Jürgen Kurbjuhn (born July 26, 1940 in the town of Tilsit) is a former German football player.

Kurbjuhn had excelled as a youth-international for West Germany during his time with amateur club Buxtehuder SV and joined Hamburg's biggest, Hamburger SV, in 1960 when the club had just been crowned German football champion. In 1961 he was part of the Hamburg side reaching the semi-final of the European Cup against Barcelona and part of the 1963 German Cup winning side of the club. He retired, because of injury, after ten goals in 242 Bundesliga matches in 1972.

His West Germany career lasted for only five matches in the space of April 1962 to May 1966, allowing him to stay unused by Sepp Herberger at the 1962 FIFA World Cup but keeping him off another participation as he did not make it into the squad of Herberger's successor Helmut Schön for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He played his last international on May 4, 1966, when the West Germans beat Ireland 4-0 in a friendly.

From 1988 he owned an insurance company in Buxtehude.

The Fonte di Fata Morgana ('Fata Morgana's Spring'), locally called the Casina delle Fate ('Summerhouse of the Fates'), at Grassina, not far from Florence in the commune of Bagno a Ripoli, is a small garden building, built in 1573-4 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa "Riposo" of Bernardo Vecchietti on the slope of the hill called Fattucchia.

It is among that group of artificial garden grottoes and Nympheums made for private gardens, and less well known than more visited examples, such as in the Boboli Gardens or the Medici villa at Pratolino. The Fonte di Fata Morgana is enriched with sculptures in the manner of  Giambologna. Recently acquired by the Comune di Bagno a Ripoli, the Fonte della Fata Morgana, is being meticulously restored.

Warrington South is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.   It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

The constituency has the Press Association (PA) number 612.

 Boundaries .
The constituency is one of two covering the unitary authority of Warrington, Cheshire, the other being Warrington North.  It covers the parts of the town lying south of the River Mersey, including Appleton, Grappenhall and Stockton Heath, the town centre and the Penketh and Sankey areas in the west of the town.  It also includes the village of Lymm.

 History .

The constituency was created in 1983.  Prior to then, the Warrington constituency covered the central part of the town and surrounding area, while the southern fringes were in the Runcorn constituency and the surrounding area to the north was covered by the Newton constituency.  The current boundaries were introduced at the 1997 general election, when the number of constituencies in Cheshire were increased and the new Weaver Vale seat was created.

Politically, Warrington South is considered the more interesting of the two Warrington seats.  While Warrington North is a safe seat for the Labour Party, Warrington South is regarded as a bellwether constituency, reflecting the fate of the major parties at the national level.  As such it was held by the Conservatives from 1983 until 1992 (until 1987 by the former Runcorn MP Mark Carlisle, then by Chris Butler), when it was taken by Labour's Mike Hall.  Hall moved to the new Weaver Vale seat in 1997, and Helen Southworth (also of the Labour Party) has represented the seat since then.

Most of the borough council seats in the constituency are held by the Liberal Democrats, who nevertheless have come third in recent general elections, behind the Conservatives.

Bluebeard The Autobiography of Rabo Karabekian (1916-1988) is a 1987 fictional novel by best-selling author Kurt Vonnegut. It is told as a first person narrative and describes the late years of fictional Abstract Expressionist painter Rabo Karabekian, who first appeared, rather briefly, in Breakfast of Champions. Circumstances of the novel bear rough resemblance to the fairy tale of Bluebeard popularized by Charles Perrault.  Karabekian mentions this relationship several times during the novel.

Plot summary.

At the opening of the book, the narrator, Rabo Karabekian apologizes to the arriving guests: "I promised you an autobiography, but something went wrong in the kitchen..." He describes himself as a museum guard, who answers questions to visitors coming to see his priceless collected art. He shares the lonely home with his live-in servants and Paul Slazinger, a wounded World War II veteran.

One afternoon, Circe Berman wanders onto Karabekian's private beach. When he reaches out to greet her, she catches him by surprise with the forward statement "Tell me how your parents died." He tells her the story and proceeds to
invite her back to his home for a drink. After a drink and supper, Karabekian invites her to stay with him, as Slazinger does. After time, he finds her charm "manipulative," as she typically gets her way. Mrs. Berman does not respect his abstract art collection, including works by Jackson Pollock. She explores every inch of Karabekian's home, constantly asking him questions. The only place off limits to her is the potato barn.

The potato barn is the home of Karabekian's studio and holds his "secret". It has no windows, and Karabekian has gone through the trouble of nailing one end shut and immobilizing the other with six padlocks. The secret of the potato barn has enticed collectors to make outrageous offers and to raise suspicions of stolen masterpieces. It is to remain locked until after Karabekian's passes away.

Characters in "Bluebeard".
Rabo Karabekian   Karabekian is a 71 year old, one eyed, Armenian immigrant painter. He lives in 19-room house on the waterfront of East Hampton, Long Island, which he inherited from his second wife Edith.

Circe Berman - Circe selects Karabekian's home as a place to research and write about working-class adolescents living with multimillionaires. She is a well published novelist under the pen name "Polly Madison.";

Paul Slazinger - Slazinger is a poor, wounded World War II veteran. Though he owns his own home, he stays with Karabekian and eats from his kitchen. He refuses permanent residence on the grounds that "he can only write at home." He has had 11 novels published, but is not in the league of Circe Berman.

Dan Gregory - Karabekian became "Gregorian's" apprentice at the age of 17. A magazine article estimated him to be the highest paid artist in American history.

Marilee Kemp - Marilee was Dan Gregory's mistress, who persuaded Gregory to take Karabekian as his apprentice.

Edith Taft - Edith was Karabekian's second wife of 20 years.

Dorothy Roy - Dorothy is Karabekian's first wife. She left with their 2 boys, Terry and Henri. ;

Rabo's Parents - Karabekian's parents were survivors of the Armenian genocide.

Allison White - She is Karabekian's live-in cook, though he never refers to her as anything besides that. She has a daughter Celeste, who also lives with them.

Christian Joseph Edward Stepien (born June 13, 1978 in Toronto, Canada ) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and photographer.   Stepien's music career began in 1998 with the release of "In the middle of...", a collection of folky, acoustic tracks.  His music has since infused a more ska/reggae feel, along the lines of the seminal California group Sublime.  His first foray into poetry came in 2001 with his book "I am not here", followed in rapid succession by "I fall into oblivion" and the critically acclaimed "The Palimpsest mind of Christian Stepien" in 2003.  


The Music Scene.

When Stepien's first band split in 1998, he went solo and decided to perform under the name "Brodie".  He released a 6 song EP entitled "In the middle of..." in September of that year, and soon after Dan Parker joined him forming a duo.  For the next two years the two would release an EP and a full length album, have two of their tracks featured in a USA Network movie entitled The Stalking of Laurie Show, and play shows around Toronto meeting some of the up and coming bands in the city.  They became a staple in the scene, playing along side friends like Billy Talent and The Meligrove Band, having gone to high school with the former.  Eventually, the two went their separate ways and Christian decided to play solo for good.



As a solo artist, and still under the name "Brodie", Christian released another EP and yet another full-length album.  In 2003 he decided to drop the name "Brodie" and start performing under his own name.  

Poetry Takes Over.

In 2001, while taking a poetry course at York University in Toronto, Christian came upon the work of Allen Ginsberg.  He immediately took to the poet, reading everything he could get his hands on.  Over time, Stepien's lyrics had become more and more important to him, and he was starting to feel that it may be time to bring them out from behind the music.  That year he published his first book of poetry entitled "I am not here".  It was released in small numbers, but was a huge step for Christian as an artist.  

The following year he released "I fall into oblivion", followed in 2003 by "The palimpsest mind of Christian Stepien".  Both books were released to critical acclaim, and were accepted into some of the world s most prestigious institutional libraries such as those at Oxford, Harvard and Yale.  

Photography: A New Love.

In 2004 Christian's father gave him his original Pentax Spotmatic camera 
, which he purchased in 1972.  Stepien took to photography quickly, much like with music, and poured all his energy into this newly discovered art form.  Shooting at anything and everything, he spent the first while getting used to the camera and figuring out the technical aspects of the art.  

A few months later he discovered the work of Ansel Adams and he knew he had found his calling.  Simply put, his goal was not to 'reproduce' the shots Adams took, but create a similar 'emotion' that Stepien himself felt when he looked at Ansel's work.  He focused primarily on landscape photography, and spent much of his free time driving through the vast ridge that is the Niagara Escarpment with his brother, Damien Stepien, and girlfriend, Marina Stojanovic.  In 2006 his first gallery exhibition was held in Mississauga, Ontario along side the work of his brother Damien and fellow photographer Susie Hanes.


The Dagobah Project.
In 2006 Christian, along with his brother Damien, created The Dagobah Project, an entity under which all their creative endeavors would be released.  It is much more then an umbrella term for the brothers, however.  In Christian's words, "The philosophy behind the Dagobah Project is simple: live simple, live free, live happy. We strive to make life as peaceful as possible, using art as our vehicle".  

The name Dagobah came from George Lucas's film The Empire Strikes Back and is the planet where the character Yoda lives.  The Stepien brothers decided upon the name not simply because of their affection for all the Star Wars films, but also their admiration for Lucas who to this day remains an independent film maker.

On Art.

"I took up the guitar because I loved music, but soon came to realize that it gave me an identity.  Where once there was just an average teenager now stood a "Musician".

Later I turned to poetry because I loved the way simple words, if manipulated correctly, could evoke such strong emotions in people.  I soon came to realize that in creating poetry I was reflecting upon my life, and in doing so it gave me a sense of self.  Where once there was a simple musician now stood a self-aware human being.  

I then picked up a camera and turned to photography because I loved the way the supposedly "mundane" could have its deserved moment in the spotlight.  While making photographs I came to realize that in closely examining the world around me I was discovering where I, as an inhabitant of this world, fit in.  Where once there was an egocentric artist now stood an empathetic human being.

For me, it has nothing to do with money, fame, or even the products themselves.  For me, creating art is an exploration into the human condition.  It is about becoming attuned to the world, both natural and human, and understanding that life is simply a small flash on a ripple in the whirlpool that is the universe.  Empathy, humility, and wisdom are the goals for which I strive through a vessel that can be summed up in 3 letters: Art." - Christian Stepien

<doc id="617243" title="Dreamtime (album)" nonfiltered="7" processed="7" dbindex="1480006">


Dreamtime is a studio album by The Cult. Out of the shadows of gothic rock, Dreamtime was a bold attempt to fuse the mysticism of The Doors with the passion of The Sex Pistols and giving the first steps to their future hard rock direction. Conjuring up Native American imagery, the album was a curious and romantic creature on the evolutionary path to alternative rock. 
Released on 31 September 1984, it reached #21 in the UK, was certified platinum after having sold 100.000 copies in Britain, and the first single, 'Spiritwalker' reached #1 on the indie charts. Dreamtime has subsequently been reissued (or in some cases bootlegged) in roughly 30 countries worldwide. 

Lyrics to the song 'Horse Nation' are taken almost verbatim from the book titled 'Bury my heart at Wounded Knee'.
'Spiritwalker' is a reference to shamanism, 'Dreamtime' is inspired by the Australian Aborigines, 'Butterflies' is in reference to the Hopi ceremonial butterfly dance.
'A Flower in the Desert' is a reworking of the Southern Death Cult's song 'Flowers in the Forest'.

The record was originally being produced by Joe Julian, but after having recorded the drums tracks the band decided to replace him, and Beggars Banquet suggested John Brand. The record was ultimately produced by Brand, but guitarist Billy Duffy has said that the drum tracks used on the record were those produced by Julian, as Nigel Preston by that time had become too unreliable.

Track listing.
All songs written by Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy, except where noted.
A1 "Horse Nation"   3:45 ;
A2 "Spiritwalker"   3:39 ;
A3 "83rd Dream"   3:38 ;
A4 "Butterflies"   3:00 ;
A5 "Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)"   3:59 ;
B1 "Gimmick"   3:33 ;
B2 "A Flower in the Desert" (Astbury/Jepson/Burroughs/Quereshi)   3:42 ;
B3 "Dreamtime"   2:47 ;
B4 "Rider in the Snow"   3:11 ;
B5 "Bad Medicine Waltz"   5:55 ;
 "BoneBag"   3:47 (CD bonus track);
 "Sea and Sky"   3:32 (CD bonus track);
 "Resurrection Joe"   6:07 (CD bonus track);
 "Love removal Machine" ("Peace" version) (Russian and eastern Europe only);
 "Zap City" (Russian and eastern Europe only);

There is a slightly longer version of 'Spiritwalker', with a running time of 3:54.

The record was largely recorded at Rockfield studios, in Monmouth, Wales, in late March and early April 1984. Mixed at Eel Pie, Twickenham, 16 - 24 April 1984. Mastered on 27 April 1984.  
This record was originally intended to be released on Situation Two, with a catalogue number SITU 57 (or 12). This pressing was to include the original version of "Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)" which uses a psychedelic phasing on the end choruses. Only a small handful of white label test pressings were made of this record, before the band decided they didn't like that version. They subsequently recorded a new version of the song after being signed on to Beggars Banquet Records, and that second, more "finalised" version of the song was released. The rerecording of "Go West (Crazy Spinning Cirlces)" was done at Livingstone studios on 22 June 1984. The original test pressing of "Dreamtime" stands as one of the rarest and arguably most collectable of all Cult vinyl pressings.

'Bone Bag' listed as Bonebag was the original b side on the 'Spiritwalker' single. 'Sea and Sky' was the original b side of 'Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)' and 'Resurrection Joe' misspelled "Ressurection Joe" was a new single recorded in November 1984 and released on 14 December 1984. They are included as bonus tracks on the original CD pressings in all countries except the original CD pressing in the Netherlands, where only the 10 original songs are present. The first CD version in the Netherlands also uses different artwork for the back cover
Released originally with a nine song live album titled 'Dreamtime Live at the Lyceum', recorded at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 20 May 1984, and also released in the UK with different artwork, and on 23 November 1984 also as a picture disc. There were only 30.000 copies of the live record originally manufactured. This double album version was released in a thicker cardboard sleeve.

In France, a special promotional 12" record was issued, consisting of three tracks: 
 "Spiritwalker";
 "Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles) ";
 "83rd Dream (recorded live at the Lyceum on 20 May 1984)";
The full album was later released in France, packaged with the live album 'Dreamtime live at the Lyceum'.

The Japanese LP features a photo of the band on the front cover, instead of the original artwork.
When remastered and reissued on CD in 1996, only the 10 original songs were included. 

On the original Canadian vinyl pressing, the tracklisting is re-arranged for unknown reasons:

A1 "Gimmick"   3:33 ;
A2 "Spiritwalker"   3:39 ;
A3 "83rd Dream"   3:38 ;
A4 "Butterflies"   3:00 ;
A5 "Bad Medicine Waltz"   5:55 ;
B1 "Horse Nation"   3:45 ;
B2 "A Flower in the Desert" (Astbury/Jepson/Burroughs/Quereshi)   3:42 ;
B3 "Dreamtime"   2:47 ;
B4 "Rider in the Snow"   3:11 ;
B5 "Go West (Crazy Spinning Cirlces)"   3:59;

In Czechoslovakia in January 1991, two versions of this record were released by Globus International: one is on black vinyl, and the other is on blue vinyl. The blue vinyl version is apparently quite rare. Both Czechoslovakian pressings use the artwork from the second British pressing.
In 2003, the album was remastered and reissued on CD in the Russian Federation, Belarus and Lithuania with the three bonus tracks and different artwork. In October 2004 the record was also remastered and reissued on CD with different artwork in Japan.

There is also a misprinted British CD, which uses correct artwork, but includes reggae music on the disc itself, instead of anything by The Cult.

The Persian Encyclopedia (                  ) is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative Encyclopedias written in the Persian language. It is a two-volume encyclopedia published as three physical volumes.

The encyclopedia was based, in part, on the 1953, 1960, and 1968 editions of The Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia. It was initially published under the supervision of Gholamhossein Mosaheb, who started the project in 1955 in the Franklin Book Programs office in Tehran. Mosaheb left the project after the first volume (words starting with Alef to Seen) was published in 1966.

The second volume was actually published in two "parts", making the encyclopedia three physical volumes. The first part (Sheen to Lam) was published in 1978, ten years after the first volume. it was supervised by Reza Aghsa. 

The Iranian revolution in 1979, the death of Mosaheb in the same year, and the takeover of the assets of the Franklin office in Tehran by the government delayed further publication. 

The second part (Meem to Yeh) was published by Amirkabir in 1996, eighteen years after the first part of the volume, but not mentioning a new supervisor's name. 

The encyclopedia total is 3385 three-column pages. Unfortunately, the number of entries in the encyclopedia is not mentioned.

The three volumes were republished with minor changes by Amirkabir in 2002 (ISBN 964-303-044-X).

The first USS McLanahan (DD-264) was a Clemson-class destroyer in the United States Navy and transferred to the Royal Navy where she served as HMS Bradford (H72) during World War II. 

As USS McLanahan.

Named for Tenant McLanahan, McLanahan was laid down 20 April 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 22 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Charles M. Howe; and commissioned 5 April 1919, Commander R. B. Coffey in command.

After shakedown off the Massachusetts coast, McLanahan was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. At San Diego, California in October 1919 she was placed in reserve and decommissioned in June 1922. She remained at San Diego until recommissioning 18 December 1939. Then, following overhaul and fitting out, she steamed to the east coast. On 8 October 1940 she decommissioned as a U.S. Navy ship at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and commissioned in the Royal Navy, under the terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, as Bradford (H72).

<doc id="7952748" title="Frank Edwards (Irish Communist)" nonfiltered="11" processed="11" dbindex="1480010">
Frank Edwards (1907 7 June 1983) was a teacher and prominent Irish communist.

Edwards's parents were Belfast Catholics who relocated to Waterford.  His father served, and died, in the British Army during the First World War. His elder brother, Jack Edwards, was the Waterford organiser of the one-day general strike against the enforcement of conscription in Ireland.  Jack was active in the Irish War of Independence and then joined the Irregulars in the Irish Civil War.  In Kilkenny Gaol, he was shot "trying to escape" as a reprisal for a Free State officer killed in Waterford.

While teaching at Mount Sion Christian Brothers School, Waterford, Frank Edwards became the Waterford leader of the Republican Congress in 1934. The Roman Catholic Church had denounced the Congress and advised against participation in its foundation meeting.  When Edwards denounced local slum-landlords, not realising that some of the property was owned by the Catholic church, this brought him to the notice of Archdeacon Byrne. Edwards was investigated by the Church authorities and Bishop Kinnane ordered he leave his teaching post.  Edwards was supported at first by his union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and a national scandal ensued; but the Church stood firm, stating that the Congress had betrayed "The Republic" and sought to install "the Russian model".

In late 1936 Edwards went to Spain as a member of the Connolly Column, fought in the Front at Lopera (where only 66 of the 150 Irish engaged did not become casualties) and was wounded at Las Rozas on the Madrid Front.

He returned to Ireland, where he was now blacklisted, lost a post with Pye Radio for organising a union, worked as a labourer laying pipes, and, at the outbreak of the Second World War, found a teaching post at Zion School, a Jewish foundation on the South Circular Road.  He retired thirty years later from this "temporary" post.

Edwards was a founder in 1946, and Secretary from 1955 of the Ireland-Soviet Friendship Society.  This led to his reputation as "the Kremlin's man in Dublin".  He died in 1983 after a long illness.

A twisted horseshoe roll is a roller coaster element in which there are two inversions (much like a cobra roll or batwing). It begins with a clockwise corkscrew, a 180 degree banked turn, and ends a second corkscrew, this one going counter-clockwise. 

Despite having a similar name, this element bears no real resemblence to the roller coaster element known as a horseshoe.

The only roller coaster in existence with such an inversion is the as-of-yet-uncompleted Maverick at Cedar Point. On Maverick, the trains exit the twisted horseshoe roll going in the same direction as when they entered, though it would not necessarily be impossible to build such an element in which the trains exit going in the opposite direction (as is the case of a cobra roll or batwing).

George Batten (1854-1918) was a New Jersey native, the former Ayer employee opened George Batten Newspaper Advertising Agency on Park Row in New York in 1891. Fiercely religious and humorless, he endeavored to make his ads 100% accurate. His values and personal dignity are credited with adding respectability to the ad profession. His $8 million-billing agency was merged with the $23 million Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BDO) in 1928, after both agencies had moved into the new office building at 383 Madison Ave., to create BBDO -- and Madison Avenue.

Asa Whitney (1797 - August 1872) was an American merchant and railroad projector.

He was one of the first backers of an American Transcontinental Railway. It was as early as 1830 that Whitney first became enthralled with railroads and foresaw their future role in business and transport. He first stopped on a buying trip, to ride the newly formed Liverpool and Manchester Railway. 

He made one of the first formal proposals to the US Government on building a Transcontinental Railroad. For years he was rejected and continued to write revised memorials and take expeditions through what was then known as Indian Territory to support his cause. After more than ten years of trying he at last gave up. 

Later Whitney's dream was realized through the efforts of Theodore Judah, a young ambitious engineer who tirelessly worked to make the railroad possible.

A fire hazard is any situation in which there is a greater than normal risk of harm to people or property due to fire. Fire hazards can take the form of ways that fires can easily start, such as a blocked cooling vent, or overloaded electrical system, ways fires can spread rapidly, such as an insufficiently protected fuel store or areas with high oxygen concentrations, or things which, in a fire, pose a hazard to people, such as materials that produce toxic fumes when heated or blocked fire exits.

The "spot" resolutions were offered in the United States House of Representatives on 22 December 1847 by Abraham Lincoln, Whig representative from Illinois. The resolutions requested President James K. Polk to provide Congress with the exact location (the "spot") upon which blood was spilt on American soil, as Polk had claimed in 1846 when asking Congress to declare war on Mexico. So persistent was Lincoln in pushing his "spot resolutions" that some began referring to him as "spotty Lincoln." Lincoln's resolutions were a direct challenge to the validity of the president's words, and representative of an ongoing political power struggle between Whigs and Democrats. 

According to Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald, "nobody paid much attention to his resolutions, which the House neither debated nor adopted". Many Democrats regarded the resolutions as unpatriotic; some Whigs cautioned that criticism of the war would hurt the Whigs politically. Lincoln, however, was not speaking out against the war itself, but rather against Polk's conduct of it. The Whigs would in fact nominate as their candidate Zachary Taylor, a hero of the war, whom Lincoln supported.

In Polk's report, the President stated that the American soldiers fell on American soil, but they actually fell on disputed territory that Mexico had historical claims to. To find out where the soldiers fell was important because Congress was near to declaring war on Mexico.

Rusyn is an East Slavic language (along with Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian to which it shares a common linguistic ancestry) that is spoken by the Rusyns.  There is controversy among linguists concerning whether Rusyn is a separate East Slavic language or a dialect of Ukrainian .

It is spoken in the Transcarpathian Region of Ukraine, in eastern Slovakia, southern Poland (where it is often called  emkowski 'Lemko', from their characteristic word lem/    'only'), and Hungary. The Pannonian Rusyn language in Serbia is sometimes considered part of the Rusyn language, although some linguists consider that language to be West Slavic. In Ukraine, Rusyn is often considered a dialect of Ukrainian, as it is very close to the Hutsul dialect of Ukrainian, but speakers sometimes prefer to consider themselves distinct from Ukrainians.

Attempts to standardize the language suffer from its being divided between four countries, so that in each of these countries there has been devised a separate orthography (in each case with Cyrillic letters) and grammatical standard, based on different Rusyn dialects. The cultural centres of Carpatho-Rusyn are Pre¨ov in Slovakia, Uzhhorod and Mukacheve in Ukraine, Krynica and Legnica in Poland, and Budapest in Hungary. Many very active Rusyns also live in Canada and the USA.

It is very difficult to count the speakers of Rusyn, but their number is sometimes estimated at almost a million, most of them in Ukraine and Slovakia. The first country to officially recognize Rusyn, more exactly Pannonian Rusyn, as an official language was former Yugoslavia. In 1995, Rusyn was recognized as a minority language in Slovakia, enjoying the status of official language in municipalities where more than 20% of the inhabitants speak Rusyn.

 The Rusyn language is divided as follows: ;
 Hutsul is spoken in the mountainous part of Suceava County and Maramures County in Romania and the extreme southern parts of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (as well as in parts of the Chernivtsi and Transcarpathian Oblasts, and on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains. ;
 Boyko is spoken on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. It can also be heard across the border in the Subcarpathian Voivodship of Poland ;
 Lemko is spoken outside Ukraine in the Pre¨ov Region of Slovakia along the southern side of the Carpathian Mountains. ;
 Dolinian Rusyn or Subcarpathian Rusyn is spoken in the Transcarpathian Oblast.;
 Pryashiv Rusyn is the Rusyn spoken in the Pre¨ov (in Rusyn: Pryashiv/Pryashuv)  region of Slovakia, as well as by some émigré communities, primarily in the United States of America. ;
 Ba ka Rusyn is spoken in northwestern Serbia and eastern Croatia. Rusin language of the Ba ka dialect is one of the official languages of the Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina).

In the introduction to the book "Slavic languages," written in 1973, ten years before glasnost, Samuel Bernshtein writes about "western Ukrainians" and the "literary language" which they "until recently 1973" had.

The North Side Gang, also known as the North Side Mob, was the dominant Irish-American criminal organization (although a large number of Polish and German-Americans were members as well) within Chicago during the Prohibition from the early to late 1920s and principal rival of the Johnny Torrio-Al Capone organization, later known as the Chicago Outfit. 

Impact of the North Side Gang. 


History of the North Side Gang.
Early history.
The North Side Gang, like many other Chicago based Prohibition gangs, originally formed from the numerous street gangs in existence during the turn of the century, particularly the Market Street Gang. A street gang made up of pick pockets, sneak thieves and labor sluggers which occupied the 42nd and 43rd Wards prior to World War I, the group especially distinguished itself during the "Circulation Wars" of the early 1910s between the newspapers Chicago Examiner and Chicago Tribune. It was during the Circulation Wars that future Northside leader Dion O'Bannion, then a member of the juvenile satellite Little Hellions, who would develop valuable contacts including politicians and journalists. O'Bannion and other members of the Northsiders would be mentored by safecracker Charles Reiser prior to Prohibition. Upon the announcement of the Volstead Act in 1919, O'Bannion was one of the many members of the Market Streeters to enter bootlegging during the first years of Prohibition.

Prohibition.
Originally based on the North Clark Street restaurant McGovern's Saloon and Cafe, the Northsiders, upon taking control of the breweries and distilleries in operation following the passage of the Volstead Act (thus ensuring a near monopoly on supplying real beer and high quality whiskey compared to the rotgut liquor and moonshine of rival competitors), would soon control the working class neighborhoods of the 42nd and 43rd Wards within months of Prohibition (although they continued committing burglary of local stores and warehouses and running illegal gambling operations). Strengthening his political protection through election fraud as well as a publicity campaign with large scale donations to orphanages and charities as well as giving out food and loans to the poor and unemployed in the neighborhoods of Chicago's North Side. 

As Sicilian and other Italian-American gangs arose in Chicago's Southside, such as the Gennas and later arrival of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone, O'Bannion's steadfast resistance to sell portions of North Side distilleries (as well as pre-existing hostility between Irish and Italian-Americans) would cause tensions to rise between the two groups. During several meetings arranged by Torrio, O'Bannion would often provoke the Italians weither by direct insults or through hijacking beer shipments and selling it back to the owners. However, the North Side Gang would also have trouble with other ethnic gangs, including a 1921 incident in which O'Bannion shot Ragen's Colts member Davy "Yiddles" Miller after insulting a North Side member at a local opera. 

Although O'Bannion and Weiss were arrested and charged with burglary in 1922, the North Side Gang enjoyed considerable police protection from the Chicago police department despite a later investigation by Chicago reform Mayor William E. Dever following the attendance of several high ranking police officials including Chief Detective Michael Hughes and Lieutenant Charles Evans (as well as County Clerk Robert Sweitzer and Public Works commissioner Colonel Albert A. Sprague with a large number of Democrat and Republican politicians) at a banquet hosted in honor of O'Bannion, later dubbed by the press as the "Balshazzar Feast". Chicago police would also assist the North Side Gang, most notably in the 1924 robbery of the Sibly Distillery, then under federal guard since the beginning of Prohibition, when O'Bannion gunmen looted the distillery in broad daylight carrying away 1,750 bonded whiskey worth around $1 million and were escorted by Police Lieutenant Michael Grady and four detective sergeants (although later indicted, charges against Grady and the other police officers were quickly dismissed). 

Although agreeing in early 1924 to an uneasy alliance with Torrio and Capone, largely brokered by Mike Merlo, relations between the two organizations quickly began to dissolve following O'Bannion's demands to collect a $30,000 gambling debt from "Bloody" Angelo Genna (who, with members of his gang, were allowed to be exempted from payment) from losses at the co-owned gambling casino The Ship. 

Although Torrio persuaded Genna to pay his gambling debt, O'Bannion further provoked Torrio after arranging a police raid on one of his own breweries when he attempted to sell Torrio the valuable Sieben Brewery on May 19. It was after Torrio's release, after demands from the Gennas, that he agreed the gang leader be killed. 

On November 10, shortly after the death of Merlo, O'Bannion was killed when three unidentified men entered his flower shop and shot him several times. This was to be the beginning of a five year gang war between the North Side Gang against Johnny Torrio's Chicago Outfit that would end only with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929.

War with the Chicago Outfit.
After the death of Dion O'Banion, Hymie Weiss assumed leadership of the gang and on January 12, 1925, Weiss, with Bugs Moran and Vincent Drucci, attempted to kill Al Capone at a Chicago South Side restaurant, firing at Capone's car and injuring chauffeur Sylvester Barton although Capone was unharmed.

On January 24, shortly after the assassination attempt on Capone, Weiss, again with Moran, Drucci, and Frank Gusenberg ambushed Torrio as he returned from shopping with his wife. Shooting him several times, Torrio was wounded along with his chauffeur Robert Barton. As George Moran was about to kill the wounded Torrio, the gun misfired and the gang members were forced to flee the scene as the police arrived. Although surviving the attack, Torrio quickly decided to retire to Italy and gave leadership of Torrio's organization to his lieutenant Al Capone.

The Northsiders under Weiss, Drucci and Moran. 


St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
On February 14, 1929 four unidentified men, dressed as Chicago police officers, stormed into a North Side Street garage and ordered seven members of the North Side Gang against a wall where they were gunned down. The only member to survive, Peter Gusenburg, died hours later at a nearby Chicago hospital refusing to name his attackers. Known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the attack effectively ends the five year gang war between Al Capone and Bugs Moran.

Aftermath.
Although Moran had survived the attempt on his life, as had Torrio only years before, much of the gangs veteran gunmen were killed in the attack. The North Side Gang still held control over the 42nd and 43rd Wards, and although an attempt would be made to hold their territory against rivals such as Frank McErlane in 1930, the power of the North Side Gang slowly declined during the early 1930's. It was later suspected Moran was part of the gunmen who killed Jack McGurn, organizer of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in 1936. However, Moran was powerless to stop the National Crime Syndicates takeover of the North Side's gambling operations, the organizations only remaining source of income following the end of Prohibition, and by the end of the decade Moran had left the Chicago underworld leaving the North Side territory to be absorbed into the Chicago Outfit.

<doc id="5268509" title="Dead Moon (game)" nonfiltered="38" processed="38" dbindex="1480037">


Dead Moon (     - Tsuki Sekai no Akumu in Japan) is the title of a video game released for the TurboGrafx-16. It was developed and published by Natsume Inc. and released on February 22, 1991 in Japan and later in 1991 in the United States. It is a side scrolling action shooter with the player piloting a space ship in order to stop an alien infestation of the Moon. The game starts out on Earth but then sends the player into outer space to combat the attack.

Storyline.
200 years after man began exploration of the solar system, an event occurred. A comet was detected near Pluto that was entering our system and approaching Earth. It was calculated to miss the planet by 1.2 billion kilometers. As probes were sent to monitor the comet, the comet sought them out and destroyed them, after which it set its course directly for Earth. The UN scrambled to avert certain distaster by sending out orbit shifting (ATFI) missiles to stop the comet. Upon their impact, the comet's course changed and it crashed into the Moon. When probes were sent to inspect the damage, what they found was a host of alien military space crafts.

Gameplay.
The game starts off with two ships in reserve and three cluster bombs. The spaceship moves left-to-right, with the screen being at rest only at certain areas, such as boss battles. Periodically during enemy barriages, supply ships will enter the screen near the top or bottom and, if shot, will release upgrades. Multiple pickups of the same color/upgrade will increase the potentcy of the weapon to a maximum of three and allow the ship to take one more extra hit per pickup to a maximum of three. With each hit, the ship will lose one level of weapon increase and once the ship is at its base weapon level, it will be destroyed on the next hit. If the ship gains a certain color/upgrade once it has reached its three upgrade limit, the ship will gain one cluster bomb per pickup. There are six levels (called scenes), each with a mid-level boss and scene boss.
Weapon upgrades.

Circular spreader - red - This upgrade enable the ship to shoot out circular energy clusters in a wide area. As multiple red canisters are picked up, this area increases.
Laser beam - blue - Three laser beams fire from the craft and rotate around in the air towards the other end of the screen. As multiple blue canisters are picked up, the number of beams increases as well as the area the beams cover.
Waves - green - An upgrade that provides laser beams that looks like waves. As multiple green canisters are picked up, the wave increases in width.
Standard spreader - yellow - This is a modification of the standard weapon, increasing the weapon range diagonally in a spread-like area. As multiple yellow canisters are picked up, the spreader area increases and also shoots out the rear of the ship.
Ship upgrades.
Homing missile - This upgrade adds homing missiles being deployed ever time the regular gun is fired. They appear from the top and bottom of the craft. With each multiple pickup, the number of missiles and their frequency increases.
Defensive orbs - This upgrade provides the ship with orb-like objects that can take hits unharmed. With each multiple pickup, the number of orbs increases and they will start to rotate instead of being stationary.
Levels.

 City - first level - The game starts with the ship over a city skyline, where the aliens have begun to invade. The mid-level bosses here are two typical looking flying saucers. At the end of the level is a giant skeleton bird whose weak spot is its heart. Once this creature is defeated, the ship blasts off to the Moon in the background.
 Space - second level - This level takes you from just outside the atmosphere of Earth to the Moon. Along the way, the ship has to contend with asteroids and space debris as well as the alien ships. The mid-level bosses are F-15-looking ships. At the end of the level is a giant turtle that recedes in its shell in order to bounce around the screne at the ship. It also breathes fire.
 Moon - third level - The next scene takes place on the surface of the Moon. As the ship skims the surface, alien enemies both on the ground and above it attack. The mid-level boss here is a large battle space ship. The boss at the end of the level is a skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus. Similar to the first level boss, its weak spot is also its heart.
 Cave - fourth level - Upon beating the boss on the Moon surface, the ship descends into a crater. Inside is a cave with a river, which the ship parallels. The mid-level boss, which shows up twice in the level, is a ship that is similar in style to a shellfish. It opens and closes to shoot at the ship. The boss at the end of the level is a bi-pedal bird similar to an ostrich. After defeating it, the ship lowers into the river.
 Lake - fifth level - Inside the lake, aquatic looking alien ships attack the ship. The mid-level boss is a Robotic woman jutting out of a snail shell. The level boss is a giant skeletal fish that swims back and forth from either side of the screen. From this battle, the ship approaches the surface of the water.
 Core - sixth level - Now in the core of the Moon, the ship must face the true alien enemies, which now come fast and furious. There is no mid-level boss, just a three part final boss battle. It starts with two skeletal hands that try to grab at the ship. Once these are defeated, they retreat and join with the rest of the skeletal human-like body, which spews flames. Once this part is defeated, the final part is the head of the creature, which can call forth four other duplicate heads to rotate around it. Once it is defeated, the game credits roll and the player starts the game over on a higher difficulty level where enemies need to take twice as much damage in order to be destroyed.

Monster-in-Law is a 2005 romantic comedy film, directed by Robert Luketic. It marks a return to cinema for Jane Fonda; her first film in 15 years. The screenplay is written by Anya Kochoff. The original music score is composed by David Newman and Rosey.

Tagline 1: She met the perfect man. Then she met his mother.
Tagline 2: This relationship is going to be a real mother.

Plot summary.

Charlie Cantilini (played by Jennifer Lopez) is a dogwalker from Venice Beach, California, who meets surgeon Kevin Fields (played by Michael Vartan). Kevin asks her out, and Charlie believes that she's finally found the right man.

Things start to go wrong when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola Fields (played by Jane Fonda). Viola has recently been replaced as a newscaster for someone younger, and is in meltdown. Loathing Charlie from the outset, and fearing that she'll lose her son the same way she lost her career, she decides to destroy her son's relationship. With her trusted assistant, Ruby (played by Wanda Sykes) who is secretly working against her, she tries everything possible to drive Charlie away but she does not succeed until Kevin and Charlie's wedding day. Viola turns up wearing a white dress. Charlie decides to back down as she cannot take living life with her mother-in-law trying to destroy her relationship. Then Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Gertrude, appears and they have an argument. Gertrude bears a strong resemblance to Viola. It is then after the argument that Viola realises that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile.

 Reaction.
The movie was generally panned by critics (, ), but the $43-million movie became a box-office success, earning $83 million ($153.8 worldwide)  during its theatrical run in summer 2005. This was considered good news for Jennifer Lopez, for this is her second box-office hit (the previous one was  2004's Shall We Dance?) following the notorious failure Gigli (2003). It was also good for Jane Fonda, since it was her first film since 1990's Stanley and Iris, and the two actresses were among the film's strongest points.

James Tully (18 September 1915 - 20 May 1992) was a prominent Irish trade unionist, politician and Deputy Leader of the Irish Labour Party who served as a minister in a series of Irish Fine Gael-Labour coalition governments.

James (Jim) Tully was born in Carlanstown, near Kells in County Meath. He was educated in Carlanstown NS and in St. Patrick's Classical School in Navan. He served as TD for Meath from 1954-1957 and from 1961-1982. When Labour entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael in 1973, he was appointed Minister for Local Government. In that role he became famous for two things; a massive increase in the building of public housing and an attempt to gerrymander Irish constituencies to ensure the re-election of the National Coalition in the 1977 general election. His attempt, which came to be called a Tullymander, backfired spectacularly and helped engineer a landslide for the opposition.

Tully was appointed Deputy Leader of Labour under Michael O'Leary in 1981, and was appointed Minister for Defence in the shortlived 1981-82 Fine Gael-Labour government. He suffered a shrapnel injury to his face when, while attending a military parade in Cairo as a guest of President Anwar Sadat, Sadat, whom Tully was beside, was assassinated.

Tully retired from politics in 1982.

Publius Petronius Turpilianus was a Roman politician and general.

He was consul in AD 61, but in the second half of that year he laid down that office and was appointed governor of Britain, replacing Gaius Suetonius Paulinus who had been removed from office in the wake of the rebellion of Boudica. In contrast to Suetonius's punitive measures, Petronius took a conciliatory approach, and conducted few military operations. In 63 he was replaced by Marcus Trebellius Maximus, and was appointed curator aquarum (superintendent of aqueducts) in Rome.

In 65 he was given a triumph, apparently for his loyalty to the emperor Nero. Following Nero's death in 68, Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was named Emperor by the Senate. During his march from Spain to Rome, Galba had Petronius summarily executed (or ordered him to take his own life) as a commander appointed by Nero.

He was the (adopted?) son of Publius Petronius and Plautia, sister of Aulus Plautius, the conqueror and first governor of Britain.

<doc id="5953647" title="Revenue-cap regulation" nonfiltered="44" processed="44" dbindex="1480043">


Revenue-cap regulation regulation is a system for setting the prices charged by regulated monopolies. It is contrasted with rate-of-return regulation, in which utilities are permitted a set rate of return on capital, and with price-cap regulation where total revenue is the regulated variable.

As with price-cap regulation, the system  uses "CPI - X", or, in the United Kingdom "RPI-X"   to set revenue caps. This takes the rate of inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (UK Retail Price Index, RPI) and subtracts expected efficiency savings X.  The system is intended to provide incentives for efficiency savings, as any savings above the predicted rate X can be passed on to shareholders, at least until the price caps are next reviewed (usually every five years). A key part of the system is that the rate X is based not only a firm's past performance, but on the performance of other firms in the industry: X is intended to be a proxy for a competitive market, in industries which are natural monopolies.

The choice of a revenue-cap rather than a price cap means that the regulated enterprise does not face any quantity risk. This may be appropriate in cases, such as electricity distribution, where the quantity demanded is largely outside the control of the regulated firm, and where costs may be insensitive to short-term variations in quantity demanded.

In practice, the distinction between revenue-cap and rate-of-return regulation may be lost, as regulators may end up making implicit decisions on the acceptable real rates of return on capital employed in order to arrive at price limit determinations.

Mount Guiting-Guiting is saw-tooth shaped mountain located in the heart of Sibuyan Island, one of the seven islands of Romblon Province in the Philippines. Guiting-Guiting, in the local dialect means "jagged", which explains the name of the mountain. 

In May 1982, under the leadership of Arturo T. Valdez, a joint team from the Bacolod-based Philippine Mountaineering Society (PMS) and the University of the Philippines (UP)-Mountaineers arrived in the small town of Magdiwang in the island of Sibuyan, Romblon.

With the kind cooperation of Hon. Don Morgado, then Mayor of Magdiwang, the team assaulted the mountain- the attempt of which was to be the first in the history of Romblon Province.

It was during this expedition that one of the peaks, now known as "Mayo's Peak" was named after one of the team members, Mayo Monteza, who celebrated his birthday during the climb, while one of the water spring sources now known as "Bulod's Spring" was named after one of the local guides, Bulod, who volunteered (along with another local)to join the climb.  
The team failed to take the summit on this first attempt, but came back two weeks after to finally make the final conquest.  

In the first week of June of 1982, four climbers became the first to stand at the summit of Mt. Guiting-Guiting.  

They were: Mon Ruiz; Kim Valino; Bubot Tan Torre; (all of UP Mountaineers) and Edwin Gatia of the PMS team.

For the first time in Philippine mountaineering history, a first ascent was attempted and successfully accomplished at the seemingly invulnerable and formidable Mt. Guiting-Guiting.

The Cruces River (spanish: Río Cruces) is an important river near Valdivia, Chile. Río Cruces originates from some hills near Villarica volcano and then flows southward. The southern and final part of the river follows the Valdivian Coastal Range. At the latitude of Valdivia it becames part of the Valdivia  River. The small village of Punucapa is the main centre for tourism in Río Cruces.

History.

From the beginnings the river was used by the indians to transport food for commerce. In its early days the city of Valdivia received vegetables from villages via the Cruces River. Before Valdivia became isolated from the rest of the Spanish empire due to the Arauco War, its main land route (Camino Real in spanish)  to Concepcion was drawn following the Cruces river. The river is home to thousands of birds that live in its wetlands. The wetlands were created when the soil that surrounded the river sunk during the Great Chilean Earthquake. The most known bird of the place is the Black-necked Swan. In 2004 a pulp mill opened near San José de la Mariquina, and begun to contaminate the wetlands of the river.

<doc id="5565608" title="Archdiocese of Valencia" nonfiltered="48" processed="48" dbindex="1480047">
The Archdiocese of Valencia (Latin, Valentina) is a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical territory located in north-eastern Spain, in the province of Valencia, part of the autonomous community of Valencia.  The archdiocese heads the ecclesiastical province of Valencia, having Metropolitan authority over the suffragan dioceses of Ibiza, Mallorca, Minorca, Orihuela-Alicante and Segorbe-Castellón.

 Overview .
Diocese created in Roman times, Pope Innocent VIII elevated it to an archdiocese in 1492.


The cathedral in the early days of the Reconquest was called Iglesia Mayor, then Seo (Sedes), and at the present time, in virtue of the papal concession of 16 October, 1866, it is called the Basilica metropolitana.  It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood.  In Gothic times it seems to have been dedicated to the most Holy Saviour; the Cid dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin; king Jaime the Conqueror did likewise, leaving in the main chapel the image of the Blessed Virgin which he carried with him and which is believed to be the one which is now preserved in the sacristy.  The Moorish mosque, which had been converted into a Christian church by the conqueror, appeared unworthy of the title of the cathedral of Valencia, and in 1262 Bishop Andrés de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building, with three naves; these reach only to the choir of the present building.  Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the magnificent chapter hall, and Jaime de Aragón added the tower, called "Miguelete" because it was blessed on St. Michael's day (1418), which is about 166 feet high and finished at the top with a belfry.  

In the fifteenth century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance.  Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the over-ornate style of that decadent period.  At the beginning of the eighteenth century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the façade of the main entrance.  The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the fourteenth century, the other is that of the Paláu.  The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height.  The eighteenth century-restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls.  The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows.  There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the presbyterium. It contains many paintings by eminent artists.  A magnificent silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a very beautiful little Renaissance chapel built by Pope Callixtus III.  Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Virgen de los desamparados.

In 1409 a hospital was founded and placed under the patronage of Santa María de los Inocentes; to this was attached a confraternity devoted to recovering the bodies of the unfriended dead in the city and within a radius of three miles around it. At the end of the fifteenth century this confraternity separated from the hospital, and continued this work under the name of Cofradía para el amparo de los desamparados.  King Philip IV and the Duke de Arcos suggested the building of the new chapel, and in 1647 the Viceroy Conde de Orpesa, who ad been preserved from the bubonic plague, insisted on carrying out their project.  The Blessed Virgin under the title of Virgen de los desamparados was proclaimed patroness of the city, and Archbishop Pedro de Urbina y Montoya, on 31 June, 1652, laid the corner-stone of the new chapel of this name.

The Archiepiscopal Palace, a grain market in the time of the Moors, is simple in design, with an inside cloister and a handsome chapel. In 1357 the arch which connects it with the cathedral was built. In the council chamber are preserved the portraits of all the prelates of Valencia. 

Among the parish churches those deserving special mention are:
 Sts. John (Baptist and Evangelist), rebuilt in 1368, whose dome, decorated by Palonino, contains some of the best frescoes of Spain.
 The Temple (El Templo), the ancient church of the Knights Templar, which passed into the hands of the Order of Montessa and which was rebuilt in the reigns of Ferdinand VI and Charles III.
 The former convent of the Dominicans, at present the headquarters of the capital general, the cloister of which has a beautiful Gothic wing and the chapter room, large columns imitating palm trees.
 The Colegio del Corpus Christi, which is devoted to the exclusive worship of the Blessed Sacrament, and in which perpetual adoration is carried on.
 The Jesuit college, which was destroyed (1868) by the revolutionary Committee, but rebuilt on the same site.
 The Colegio de San Juan (also of the Society), the former college of the nobles, now a provincial institute for secondary instruction. ;

The Seminary was built in 1831; from 1790 it was situated at he former house of studies of the Jesuits. Since the Concordat of 1851 it ranks as a central seminary with the faculty of conferring academic degrees.

There have been in Valencia, since very remote times, schools founded by the bishops and directed by ecclesiastics.  In 1412 a studium generale with special statutes was established. Pope Alexander VI raised it to the rank of a university on 23 January, 1500.  King Ferdinand the Catholic confirmed this two years later.  In 1830 the building was reconstructed; a statute of Luis Vivés adorns the corridor.

Among the hospitals and charitable institutions may be mentioned:
 The Casa de Misericordia.
 The Provincial hospital.
 The orphan asylum of San Vicente.
 The Infant Asylum of the Marqués de Campo.

In Gandia there was a university, and the palace of St. Francis Borgia, now the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, is preserved.

 History .
Roman period (until the 5th century):.

The city of Valencia is in the region known in ancient days as Edetania. Florus says that Junius Brutus, the conqueror of Viriathus, transferred thither (140 B.C.) the soldiers who had fought under the latter. Later it was a Roman military colony. In punishment for its adherence to Sertorius it was destroyed by Pompey, but was later rebuilt, and Pomponius Mela says that it was one of the principal cities of Hispania Tarraconensis. 

Nothing positive is known about the introduction of Christianity into Valencia, but at the beginning of the fourth century when Dacianus brought the martyrs St. Valerius, Bishop of Saragossa, and his deacon, St. Vincent of Huesca, to Valencia, the Christians seem to have been numerous. St. Vincent suffered martyrdom at Valencia; the faithful obtained possession of his remains, built a temple over the spot on which he died, and there invoked his intercession.

Visigoth period (5th to 7th centuries):.

The first historically known Bishop of Valencia is Justinianus (531-546), mentioned by St. Isidore in his Viri illustres. Justinianus wrote Responsiones, a series of replies to a certain Rusticus.

Bishops of Valencia assisted at the various councils of Toledo. Witisclus, present at the Sixteenth Council of Toledo (693), was the last bishop before the Mohammedan invasion.

Muslim period (ca. 712-1238):.

Abdelazid, son of Muzza, took the city in ca. 712 and, breaking the terms of surrender, pillaged it; he turned the churches into mosques, leaving only one to the Christians. This was without doubt the present Church of San Bartolomé or that of San Vincente de la Roqueta. 

Valencia was in the power of the Moors for more than five centuries.

It is said that at the time of the Moorish invasion the people of Valencia placed the body of St. Vincent in a boat and that the boat landed on the cape which is now called San Vincente. The King of Portugal, Alfonso Enriquez, found the body and transferred it to Lisbon.

The Cid (Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar) reconquered Valencia for the first time on 15 June, 1094, turned nine mosques into churches, and installed as bishop the French monk Jérôme. On the death of the Cid (July, 1099), his wife, Doña Ximena, retained power for two years, when Valencia was besieged by the Almoravids; although the king Alfonso VI of Castile drove them from the city, he was not strong enough to hold it. The Christians set fire to it, abandoned it, and the Almoravid Masdali took possession of it on 5 May, 1109.

Diocese of Valencia (1238-1492):.

Jaime the Conqueror, with an army composed of French, English, Germans, and Italians, laid siege to Valencia in 1238, and on 28 September of that year forced a surrender. 50,000 Moors left the city and on 9 October the king, followed by his retinue and army, took possession. The principal mosque was purified, Mass was celebrated, and the Te Deum sung.

The see was re-established, ten parishes being formed in the city; the Knights Templar and Hospitallers who had helped in the conquest, also Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, Mercedarians, and Cistercians, opened houses. The Church of San Vincente outside the walls was rebuilt and beside it a hospital. 

The consecration of the Dominican Berenguer de Castellbisbal, bishop-elect of the See of Valencia after the reconquest, was prevented because of the dispute between the Archbishops of Toledo and Tarragona for jurisdiction over the new see. Pope Gregory IX decided in favour of Tarragona, and, as Berenguer had been appointed Bishop of Gerona in the meantime, Ferrer de San Martín, provost of Tarragona (1239-43), was appointed Bishop of Valencia.

He was succeeded by the Aragónese Arnau de Peralta (1243-48) who drove the Bishop of Segovia, Pedro Garcés, from his see. The third Bishop of Valencia, the Dominican Andrés Albalat (1248-76), founder of the Carthusian monastery, began the construction of the cathedral; this was continued and finished by his successors: Gasperto de Botonach, Abbot of San Felin (1276-88); the Aragónese Dominican, Raimundo de Pont (1288-1312); the Catalonian Raimundo Gastón (1312-48); Hugo de Fenolet, formerly Bishop of Vich (1348-56); and Vidal de Blanes (1356-69).

Jaime de Aragón, Bishop of Tortosa and first cousin of king Pedro IV, succeeded to the see in 1369. Hitherto the chapter had elected the bishops, but owing to the dissensions at the death of Bishop Vidal de Blanes, Pope Urban IV reserved the right to name the bishops until 1523, when the right of presentation was granted to the Spanish kings.

At the death of Jaime de Aragón (1396), the antipope Benedict XIII kept the see vacant for more than two years, and then appointed Hugo de Lupia, Bishop of Tortosa (1398-1427).

He was succeeded by Alfonso de Borja (then Pope Callixtus III). The latter appointed Rodrigo de Borja (then Pope Alexander VI) to the See of Valencia.

Archdiocese of Valencia (since 1492):. 

Rodrigo de Borja obtained from Pope Innocent VIII the rank of metropolitan for his see (1492) and, after he was raised to the papacy (Pope Alexander VI), confirmed this decree. He also raised the studium generale of Valencia to the rank of a university, conferring upon it all the privileges possessed by other universities.

César Borgia bore the title of Archbishop of Valencia, and was succeeded by Juan de Borja y Llansol, Pedro Luis de Borja, and Alfonso de Aragón, illegitimate son of Ferdinand the Catholic and also Archbishop of Saragossa (1512-1520). 

The episcopate of the Augustinian St. Thomas of Villanova (1544-55), founder of the Colegio de la Presentación de Nuestra Señora, called also Colegio de Santo Tomás, was one of the most notable in the history of Valencia. St. Thomas was beatified (1619) by Pope Paul V, and canonized (1658) by Pope Alexander VII. His successors, Francisco de Navarra and Martín Pérez de Ayala, who attended the Council of Trent, were also men of distinction.

Perhaps the most noted of all the archbishops of Valencia was the Patriarch Juan de Ribera (1569-1611). He decided to expel the Moors from the city, after exhausted all possible means to bring them to submission. He founded the Colegio de Corpus Christi and furthered the work of monastic reform, especially among the Capuchins, whom he had brought to Valencia.

Many holy men shed lustre upon this era, including St. Louis Bertram, the Franciscan Nicolás Factor, the Carmelite Francisco de Niño Jesús, and the Minim Gaspar Bono. The archbishop and inquisitor general, Juan Tomás Rocaberti, publicly punished the Governor of Valencia for interfering in ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Andrés Mayoral Alonso de Mella (1738-69) improved the system of charities and public instruction, founded the Colegio de las Escuelas Pías, and the Casa de Enseñanza for girls. He collected a library of 12,000 volumes; this was burnt in the War of Independence. The See of Valencia has had two cardinals, Mariano Barrio y Fernández and Monescillo y Sancho.

Voice chat is a modern form of communication used on the Internet. The means of communicating with voice chat is through any of the messengers, mainly Yahoo!, AOL or MSN Messenger. Voice chat has led to a significant increase in distant communications where two people from opposite ends of the world can talk almost free of cost.

Rocket Messenger and AOL were among the first to offer voice chat facilities. They were followed by Paltalk which became a quick hit.  Later Yahoo! Messenger became the most dominant voice chat service as it provided unique features.  These included individual voice chat with another person, as well as voice chat facilities categorized in Yahoo! Rooms.

Many video games with online multiplayer allow players to communicate via voice chatting. In 2001, Sony released the Network adapter for their PlayStation 2 video game console, which allowed voice chatting with a headset. In 2002, Microsoft launched the Xbox Live service, which supports voice chatting through a headset bundled with the Xbox 360 premium package and the official starter kit. In 2005, Nintendo launched the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, an online multiplayer service for both the Nintendo DS and the upcoming Wii. In March 2006, Metroid Prime: Hunters was released, making it the first game to allow voice chatting through the Nintendo DS's microphone.

Written in 2005, Moscow, 
 Rough Draft is a fantasy novel of a "parallel world" genre. by Sergey Lukyanenko

Plot introduction.
The story features a Moscow person Kirril, who one day discover that he has the ability to go to other parallel world of the Earth we are living.
 
Plot summary.

The story starts with the hero, Kirril, being "erased" from daily life in present Moscow. Everybody forget him (even his parents and dog), other person lives in his apartment, all IDs and files in all offices disappear. After a while he is phoned and proposed to go in an old water tower   but inside is his future home and working place. There he was revealed that he is able to open doors, leading to other worlds   although at first all but one are locked. After first opened each door becomes rigidly connected to some world, but which one can't be said before. All of worlds have mostly similar environment and seem to be on the planet Earth but societies and people are different.

After a while Kirril met a special group of functionals, called so because they gained supernatural abilities making them excellent in some profession . They serve other people, but mostly other functionals. They say Kirril has become one of them   a customs officer. He benefits from taxes paid by people who pass through his tower. Also he holds a superhuman strength and is almost immortal, but only within some range (10 km) from his tower.

Kirril enjoys new worlds, people and abilities. A politician Dima meets him and asks to find a national idea for Russia. He informs Kirril about the world number One, which nobody can access and which seems to be exactly our world living 30 years later. Critical information from this world may enhance the prestige of the country.

Kirril also encounters underground, that is few people fighting against 'corporate laws' of functionals and their working for themselves or elites of worlds. But he remains untouched by rhetorics of the underground, justifying most of this. Ideas of armed opposition are alien if not to say ridicilous for him. But a younger 20-aged girl who Kirril fell in love with is a genuine underground activist...

The last door opened leads to the world number one: A lovely Moscow filled with smiling people; there were no Second World War and no horrors of revolution, due to this world lags for 30 years and rulers of it carefully study mistakes of others. It's just what Dima proposed to Kirril, but applied reversly.

Upon rather bloody returning to our world, Kirril faces troubles with his girl. Hating system of functionals, she manifests disobedience. But their laws don't forgive this, and functioner Natalie murders her, Kirril being unable to resurrect her...

"An extreme foolishness," said I, "All these loud words and beautiful poses... 'they will not pass', 'yet it moves', 'motherland or death', 'am able to die for my beliefs'   all of this becomes nonsense when real death comes... All of this is for kids. And for adults who handle them...";
Natalie nodded with approval.;
"But yet it moves" said I, "Doesn't it? It moves, and they will not pass, and motherland remains motherland even if death becomes death, and nobody is ready to die, but sometimes it's easier to die than to betray...";

In Kirril's fighting Natalie, his tower became devastated, this ceased his being a functional and restored his former life. The ending of this story we will learn from the second book of the future duology.

Lopoliths are generally concordant with the intruded strata with dike or funnel-shaped feeder bodies below the body. The term was first defined and used by Frank Fitch Grout during the early 1900s in describing the Duluth gabbro complex in northern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario.

Lopoliths typically consist of large ultramafic to mafic layered intrusions that range in age from Archean to Eocene. Examples include the Duluth gabbro, the Sudbury intrusion of Ontario, the Bushveld igneous complex of South Africa, the Skaergaard complex of Greenland and the Humboldt lopolith of Nevada. The Sudbury and Bushveld occurrences have been attributed to impact events and associated crustal melting.

The 21st SS Division Skanderbeg was a Waffen SS Mountain division set up by Heinrich Himmler in March 1944, officially under the title of the 21st Waffen-Gebirgs Division der SS Skanderbeg (albanische Nr. 1). It was named after George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, a national hero of Albanians who resisted Ottoman invasion for 25 years.

Formation.

The names of 11,398 recruits were submitted to Berlin. Of these, 9,275 were deemed suitable for drafting, and 6,491 were actually drafted into the Waffen SS. The final division was formed up by these recruits, three hundred ethnic Albanians transferred from the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar and some German veterans from Austria and Volksdeutsche officers, NCOs and enlisted men. The final total strength of the division was at 8,500 to 9,000 men, consisting of two infantry regiments, a single artillery regiment, a reconnaissance battalion, a mountain combat engineer battalion, a signals battalion and an anti-tank battalion. 

Many Albanians in Kosovo saw the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by Axis Powers as an opportunity to secede from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (who treated Albanians as second class citizens in the kingdom ), and eventually merge with Albania. In 1941 Albania, Western Macedonia, and majority of Kosovo were under Italian control. Following the surrender of Fascist Italy in 1943, the territories under discussion, inhabited largely by Albanians were occupied by Nazi Germany. The 21st Waffen SS Mountain Division was the only fully ethnic Albanian division to be recruited during the Second World War. It was established originally to combat partisans with the promise that the territories with a majority Albanian population were to become an independent and unified state to include Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia or what Albanian nationalists called  natural Albania  or "Great Albania".

The division was placed under the command of SS-Standartenfuhrer August Schmidhuber, later promoted to SS-Oberfuhrer. It fought partisans who were on the increase and consolidating their actions, both in Albania and Yugoslavia as the Second World War was drawing to an end. In Kosovo, the division embarked on ethnic cleansing of the Serbs, especially those who were previously settled in Kosovo through agrarian reform and colonization of Kosovo with Serbs and Montenegrins, through the program the Kingdom of Yugoslavia implemented from 1918-1941. At least 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the pursecution while around 10,000 Serbs lost their lives during the ethnic cleansing.

In Kosovo, Albanian families worked to save Jews , although not all Jews survived. On the eve of World War II there were 520 Jews living in Kosovo, but during WWII, the Albanian Waffen SS Skanderbeg division were responsible for turning over some 210 Jews in Kosovo to the Gestapo, who shipped them to concentration camps. Nevertheless, the highest Jewish survival rate in ex-Yugoslavia during WWII was in Kosovo, with some 62% percent of Jews surviving.

The life of SS Skanderbeg from its establishment to surrender and dissolution was approximately one year (March 1944   March 1945). The division began disintegrating as early as October 1944 when the Germans began withdrawing from the area and partisans were closing in. By the end of November, 3,500 members of the division had  deserted from its ranks. Whatever remained of the division was reorganized into the 21st SS Mountain Skanderbeg Division, concentrated at Skopje, leading to its defense, alongside the Prinz Eugen Division, of the Vardar River valley in Macedonia, allowing German General Alexander Lohr's Army Group E to retreat from Greece. By January 1945, a group of the Skanderbeg Division retreated to Kosovka Mitrovica in Kosovo and then to Brcko in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They finally reached Austria in May, 1945, and fought until Germany's surrender. The division surrendered to Western Allied personnel. The remainders were scattered in many directions. A small number went into hiding and melted away with the population and survived. Some managed to emigrate as civilians to Western countries and a few reached even Australia. Many of the remainders, however, were executed by the partisans (communists).

SS-Brigadef hrer August Schmidthuber, one of the commanders of the 21st SS Mountain Division "Skanderbeg , was captured in 1945 and turned over to Yugoslav authorities. He was put on trial in February 1947 by a Yugoslav military tribunal at Belgrade, on charges of participating in massacres, deportations and atrocities against civilians. The tribunal sentenced him to death by hanging. He was executed on February, 27th 1947. (History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War p. 528, United Nations War Crimes Commission, London: HMSO, 1948).

The division arm patch consisted of a black double-headed eagle on a red background. Albanian recruits wore a white fez-style cap, and later the SS issued grey headgear in the same style, with the Totenkopf sewn on the front.

The duo of Pete and Geoff were DJs Pete Mitchell and Geoff Lloyd, who from January 2003 to December 2005 hosted the breakfast show on Virgin Radio. In the early 1980's, Mitchell was an aspiring musician who moved into management and production. In 1988 he joined Manchester's Piccadilly Radio and went on to be an enthusiastic champion of indie bands of the "Madchester" scene in the early nineties. He was introduced to Geoff Lloyd around this time. Lloyd was an aspiring comedy writer and performer, and a fellow radio presenter. In 1996 they were asked by Key 103 to co-present their afternoon show.

The duo rapidly established a cult following with their witty and slightly risque banter, and in 1998 won a Sony radio academy award for their show. They were subsequently recruited by Virgin Radio and again rapidly built up a significant audience for their Drivetime Show. By 2003 they were the most popular DJs on the station and were moved to the Breakfast Show in order to increase the audience. This they did very successfully, sticking to their well-established formula of slightly risque banter about contemporary news and culture, with Mitchell tending to play the "straight man" to the more outrageous Lloyd. Lloyd occasionally courted controversy with some of his remarks, most notoriously when he expressed willingness to eat the limbs of a dead baby to ease poverty. A complaint against the station was upheld and Lloyd was reprimanded for his comments. Nevertheless, the audience for the show remained strong, despite (or possibly because) of Lloyd's willingness to stray to the edge of acceptability with his remarks.

On 28 November 2005, to the dismay of their listeners, the duo announced that they were splitting up and leaving the Breakfast Show on Virgin Radio.  Their final show together took place on 16 December.  Geoff Lloyd remained at Virgin Radio, hosting the Late Show, whilst Pete Mitchell left the station to pursue other projects.  Christian O'Connell, from the Breakfast Show on XFM London replaced the pair as host of the Breakfast Show.

Geoff appeared on the Channel 4 show Richard & Judy on Thursday 8th December 2005 to celebrate the life of former Beatle, John Lennon.

The Comstock Lode is the richest known U.S. deposit of silver ore discovered under what is now Virginia City, Nevada on the eastern slope of Mt. Davidson, a peak in the Virginia range. After the discovery was made public in 1859, prospectors rushed to the area and mining camps in the vicinity, which became thriving centers of fabulous wealth. The excavations were carried to depths of more than 3200 feet (1000 meters), until the inflow of hot water brought operations to a halt. Between 1859 and 1878, it yielded $400 million in silver and gold, equivalent to approximately $500-600 billion dollars in 2005, as a relative share of GDP.  It is notable not just for the immense fortunes it generated and the large role those fortunes had in the growth of Nevada and San Francisco, but also for the advances in mining technology that it spurred. Exhaustion of the mines by wasteful and intensive exploitation started a decline about 1874 that ended in the abandonment of the lode in 1898.

 The discovery of silver .
The discovery of silver in Nevada in 1858 (then Western Utah Territory), caused considerable excitement in California and throughout the United States.  The excitement was one not seen since the discovery of gold in California ten years earlier.  According to Dan De Quille, a journalist of the period "the discovery of silver undoubtedly deserves to rank in merit above the discovery of the gold mines of California, as it gives value to a much greater area of territory and furnishes employment to a much larger number of persons".

Gold was discovered in this region in the spring of 1850.  It was discovered in Gold Canyon, by a company of Mormon emigrants on their way to the California Gold Rush. After arriving too early to cross the Sierra, they camped on the Carson river in the vicinity of Dayton, Nevada, to wait for the mountain snow to melt.  They soon found gold along the gravel river banks by panning, but left when the mountains were passable, as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching California.  Other emigrants followed, camped on the canyon and went to work at mining.  However, when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer, they continued across the mountains to California.  The camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of 1852-53, when there were 200 men at work along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers, Long Toms and sluices.

The gold from Gold Canyon came from quartz veins, toward the head of the vein, in the vicinity of where Silver City and Gold Hill now stand.  As the miners worked their way up the stream, they founded the town of Johntown on a plateau.  In 1857, the Johntown miners found gold in Six-Mile Canyon, which is about five miles North of Gold Canyon.  Both of these canyons are on what is now known as the Comstock Lode.  The early miners never thought of going up to the head of the ravines to prospect the quartz veins, spending their time on the "free" gold in the lower elevation surface deposits of earth and gravel.

Credit for the discovery of the Comstock Lode is disputed.  It is said to have been discovered, in 1857, by Ethan Allen Grosh and Hosea Ballou Grosh, sons of a Pennsylvania minister,trained mineralogists and veterans of the California gold fields.  Hosea injured his foot and died of tetanus in 1857.  In an effort to raise funds, Allen and an associate, Richard Burke, set out on a trek to California with samples and maps of their claim.  Henry Thomas Paige Comstock was left in their stead to care for the Grosch cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery. Grosch and Burke never made it to California, suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the Sierran trails.  The two suffered from gangrene and at the hands of a miner-surgeon lost their limbs through amputation, a last ditch effort to save the lives of the pair.  Allen Grosch died on December 19, 1857.  Richard Burke lived, but upon his recovery returned to his home in Canada.

When Henry T. P. Comstock learned of the death of the Grosch brothers, he took it upon himself to claim the cabin and the lands as his own.  He also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man.  What he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein.  He continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the Grosch brothers' find was still unclaimed.  Upon learning of a strike on Gold Hill which uncovered some bluish rock (Silver Ore), Comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area.  

The four miners that discovered the Gold Hill outcropping were James Fennimore ("Old Virginny"), John Bishop ("Big French John"), Aleck henderson and Jack Yount.  Their discovery was actually part of the Comstock Lode, but not a main vein.  The four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the Grosch brothers.

 Tragic fates of the discoverers .
Those who discovered the famous mine were ignorant and not well educated in mineral sciences.  The "blue stuff" kept clogging the rockers, and eventually the men grew frustrated and discouraged from their gold mining.

Patrick McLaughlin sold his interest in the Ophir claim for $3,500 which he soon lost.  He then worked as a cook at the Green mine in California.  He died working at odd jobs.

Emanuel Penrod sold his share of the interest for $8,500 .  

Peter O'Riley held on to his interests collecting dividends, until selling for about $40,000.  He erected a stone hotel on B Street in Virginia City called the Virginia House, and became a dealer of mining stocks. He began a tunnel into the Sierras near Genoa, Nevada, expecting to strike a richer vein than the Comstock.  He lost everything, went insane and died in a private asylum in Woodbridge, California.

Comstock traded an old blind horse and a bottle of whiskey for a one-tenth share formerly owned by James Fennimore ("Old Virginny"), but later sold all of his holdings to Judge James Walsh for $11,000 .  He opened trade good stores in Carson City and Silver City.  Having no education and no business experience, he went broke.  After losing all his property and possessions in Nevada, Comstock prospected for some years in Idaho and Montana without success.  In September 1870, while prospecting in Big Horn country, near Bozeman, Montana, he committed suicide with his revolver.

 Early mining and milling .

The ore was first extracted through surface diggings, but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies.  Unlike most silver ore deposits, which occur in long thin veins, those of the Comstock Lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick.  The ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel.  Although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated, the weakness of the surrounding material resulted in frequent and deadly cave-ins.

The cave-in problem was solved by the method of square-set timbering invented by Philip Deidesheimer, a German who had been appointed superintendent of the Ophir mine.  Previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings capped by a third horizontal member used to support the excavation.  However, the Comstock ore bodies were too large for this method.  Instead, as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side.  Thus, the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice.  Often these voids would be re-filled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete. By this method of building up squares of framed timbers, an ore vein of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth.

Early in the history of Comstock mining, there were heavy flows of water to contend with. This called for pumping machinery and apparatus, and as greater depth was attained, larger pumps were demanded. All the inventive genius of the Pacific Coast was called into play, and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found in any part of the world.  Initially, the water was cold, but the deeper workings cut into parts of the vein where there were heavy flows of hot water.  This water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly. Lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the vein.  The hot water called for fans, blowers and various kinds of vertilation aparatus, as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air.

Compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the Comstock mines. Diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable.  Several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed.

Great improvements were also made in the hoisting cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As the depth of the diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their breaking load.  The solution to this problem came from A. S. Hallidie in 1864 when he developed a flat woven wire rope.  This wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars.

In 1859 the Americans, as a people, knew nothing about silver mining.  In the California placer mines there were however, a large number of Mexicans, who had worked silver mines in their own country.  Initially, the Comstock miners endeavored to partner with Mexicans, or at least hire a Mexican foreman to take charge of the mine.  The Mexicans adopted their methods of arastras, patios and adobe smelting furnaces to process silver ore.  These methods proved to be too slow for the Americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted. The Americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore, and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation. The process of amalgamating crushed ore reduced the required days by the patio process, to hours by using steam-heated iron pans. Some of the German miners, who had been educated at the mining academy of Freiberg, were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores.  They introduced the barrel process of amalgamation and the roasting of ores.  While the barrel process was an improvement on the patio, it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the Comstock ores as the newly invented pan process. By these efforts it was found that the free milling ores of the Comstock were not required to be roasted.

In the early days of pan processing of ores, there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver (mercury). Almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore. They tried all manner of trash, both mineral and vegetable, including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea. At that time, untold millions in gold, silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings, as the ore on which these experiments were tried was almost pure silver.  Although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented, there was much room for improvement. Improvements were made from time to time, resulting in reductions in losses of metals, but none of the apparatus in use on the Comstock was perfect.

 The days of "bull teams" and the Virginia & Truckee Railroad .

Before railroads were built, all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from 10 to 16 horses or mules. Ore was hauled to the mills by these teams, which also brought to the mines all the wood, lumber and timber required. Teams also hauled over the Sierras all the mining machinery, all supplies required by both mines and mills, and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses. Each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons. When the large reduction works of the Ophir Mining Company were in peak operation, lines of teams from one to three miles in length moved along the wagon roads, and sometimes blocked Virginia City streets for hours.

In 1859, 1860 and 1861, great quantities of goods were transported across the Sierras to and from California on the backs of mules. When the Central Pacific Railroad line was completed, this hauling was from Virginia City to Reno via the Geiger grade wagon road, for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west.

Ground was broken on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad on February 19, 1869 and eight months thereafter, the most difficult section from Virginia City to Carson City was completed. Rails were extended North across the Washoe valley, from Carson City to Reno, where it connects with the Central Pacific.  Between Virginia City and Carson City, at Mound House, the railroad also connects with the Carson and Colorado Railroad.

 The Virginia City and Gold Hill Water Company .

When silver was first discovered on the Comstock, the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of Virginia City and Gold Hill, Nevada. As population increased wells were dug for domestic needs, and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply. As the mills and hoisting works multiplied, the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents, now thousands in number.  In this need, the Virginia City and Gold Hill Water Company was formed, being the first non-mining incorporation on the Comstock Lode.

Water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted. It became imperative to look toward the main range of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where there is an inexhaustible supply. Between the Sierra and the Virginia ranges lay the Washoe valley, a great trough nearly 2,000 feet in depth. Herman Schussler, a Swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in San Francisco, was brought to the Comstock to plan and design the new works. Surveys were made in 1872, the first sections of pipe laid June 11, 1873 and the last on July 25 the same year.

The initial pipe was made of wrought iron, a total length of over 7 miles, with an interior diameter of 12 inches and a capacity of 92,000 gallons per hour. The pipe traversed the Washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon, and at the lowest point having a pressure of 1,720 feet of water, or 800 pounds per square inch. The inlet being 465 feet above the outlet, the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure.  Water was brought to the inlet in the Sierra Nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes, and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of 12 miles to Virginia City. The pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together, each section fastened with three rows of rivets. Lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section. The first flow of water reached Gold Hill and Virginia City on August 1, 1873 with great fanfare. This accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world, having superseded the water system at Cherokee Flat, California also designed by Schussler.

The water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in 1875, and a third pipe in 1877.  These pipes of lap welded joints deliver more water, there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water.  Additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply.

 The Sutro Tunnel .

While there was a scarcity of water on the surface, there was an excess of water underground in all the mines. Floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped. Intrusion of scalding-hot water into the mines was a large problem, and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased.  To overcome these troubles, Adolph Sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the Comstock Lode from the lowest possible point. A survey was made by Schussler and work commenced in October 1869.  The Sutro Tunnel was completed from the valley near Dayton through nearly four miles of solid rock to meet the Comstock mines approximately 1,650 feet beneath the surface. From the main tunnel, branches were run north and south along the vein a distance of over two miles, connecting to various mines. The tunnel is 16 ft wide and 12 ft high. Drain flumes are sunk in the floor and over these are two tracks for horse carts. It required over eight years to complete construction. The tunnel provide drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravity-assisted ore removal.  However, by the time it reached the Comstock area mines, most of the ore above 1,650 feet had already been removed and the lower workings were 1,500 feet deeper still.  Although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel, the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served. The ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by the use of pneumatic drills.

 Big Bonanzas .

Peak production from the Comstock occurred in 1877, with the mines producing over $14,000,000 of gold and $21,000,000 of silver that year.  Production decreased rapidly thereafter, and, by 1880, the Comstock was considered to be played out.  The deepest depth was struck, in 1884, in the Mexican Winze at 3,300 feet below the surface.  Underground mining continued sporadically until 1922, when the last of the pumps was shut off causing the mines to flood. Re-processing of mill tailings continued through the 1920s, and exploration in the area continued through the 1950s.

Nevada is commonly called the "Silver State" on account of the silver produced from the Comstock Lode.  However, since 1878, Nevada has been a relatively minor silver producer, with most subsequent bonanzas consisting of more gold than silver.

 Four Kings .

George Hearst, a highly successful California prospector, became head of Hearst, Haggin, Tevis and Co., the largest private mining firm in the United States, owned and operated the Ophir mine, on the Comstock Lode, as well as other gold and silver mining interests in California, Nevada, Utah, South Dakota and Peru.  Hearst was a member of the California State Assembly and became a United States Senator from California.  George Hearst was the father of the famed newspaperman, William Randolph Hearst.

William Chapman Ralston, founder of the Bank of California, financed a number of mining operations, repossessed some of those mines as their owners defaulted, and ultimately made enormous profits from the Comstock Lode.

William Sharon, a business partner of William Chapman Ralston, was the Nevada agent for the Bank of California, and acquired Ralston's assets when his financial empire collapsed.  William Sharon became the second United States Senator from Nevada.

William M. Stewart, who abandoned mining to become an attorney in Virginia City, Nevada, participated in mining litigation and the development of mining on the Comstock Lode.  As Nevada became a State in 1864, Stewart assisted in developing the State constitution and became the first United States Senator from Nevada.

 History .
Maud is on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway near U.S. Highway 67 ten miles south of Boston and is seventeen miles southwest of Texarkana in southern Bowie County. The territory around Maud, known before the Republic of Texas era as the Red River Country, was among the earliest settled areas, but Spanish claims to the land, outlaws from the Neutral Ground, and general lawlessness discouraged extensive development. After the railroad reached the site in 1870, a community gradually began to emerge. The town was named for Maud Knapp, daughter of Samuel D. Knapp, the first postmaster and the donor of land for the townsite. A post office opened in 1881, closed the next year, then reopened in 1893. By 1910 the population of the town had reached 300, and by 1940 it had grown to 750. During World War II the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant were built six miles north of the community. These two facilities provided jobs for many Maud citizens. In 1982 Maud had eleven rated businesses and an estimated population of 1,059. The two military installations remained the largest employers of Maud residents. In 1990 the community population was 1,049.

Education.
The City of Maud is served by the Maud Independent School District.

<doc id="5558649" title=""Dawn-to-dusk" transcontinental flight across the United States" nonfiltered="69" processed="69" dbindex="1480069">
The "Dawn to dusk" transcontinental flight across the United States was a pioneering aviation record established June 23, 1924. It marked the first crossing of the North American continent within the hours of daylight.

The record was set by 1st Lt. Russell L. Maughan, a U.S. Army Air Service test pilot at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, the site of the Air Service Engineering Division and its major flight-test center.

Concept and flight plan.
The plan for the flight was conceived by the Air Service's Assistant Chief, Brig. Gen. William L. Mitchell in 1923. The Air Service since 1919 had been regularly establishing endurance, distance, altitude and speed records in airplanes to promote favorable publicity and public support for the establishment of an Air Force separate from the U.S. Army. The year before Lt. James H. Doolittle had flown a DH-4 from Florida to San Diego in a single calendar day, making just one stop in Texas for fuel. Mitchell wanted to not only improve on both the time and distance involved, but to have the stunt highly publicized by having it takeoff and land during daylight at major urban centers. The military purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate the utility of rapidly moving air units from one side of the nation to the other, a capability that the Army and Navy did not possess.

The original calculations for the flight were that in early summer, including twilight, 20 hours of daylight were available for the flight. By averaging 160 miles an hour, the distance of 2,670 miles from New York to San Francisco could be covered in 16 hours 40 minutes. Mitchell had struck a deal with Curtiss Aircraft to purchase 25 new PW-8 fighters, patterned after the R-6 Racer, if Curtiss would help modify one of the prototypes for use in the project. The D-12 engine on the PW-8 produced 435 horsepower and Mitchell's intended modifications were to enable it to make the flight at full throttle power setting. If the armament and unnecessary equipment were also removed from the XPW-8, additional fuel capacity could be installed to extend its range, and larger oil tanks for engine cooling. The flight plan calculated four stops of 30 minutes each for refueling. McCook Field; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and remote Salduro Siding, Utah, were selected as refueling points, following a recently established mail route.

Lt. Maughan was chosen to make the flight because he was an experienced test pilot and a combat veteran accustomed to dealing with in-flight emergencies, and because he had already established speed records in 1922 and 1923.

The first two attempts to set the record.
The first attempt to establish the record was flown on July 10, 1923. Lt. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field, Long Island, at 4:56 a.m. The Allegheny Mountains were obscured by a thick undercast, and unable to navigate by landmarks, Lt. Maughan flew by dead reckoning, arriving at McCook Field 90 minutes behind schedule, where a broken tail fin rib caused an additional delay. The engine of the PW-8 quit in flight over Illinois because of a clogged fuel line, and Lt. Maughan made a forced landing in a farm field, damaging the landing gear and ending the attempt. 

The second attempt to set the record was made on July 19. After a 5:08 a.m. takeoff, Lt. Maughan completed the 570-mile first leg to McCook Field at 8:35 a.m, taking off again at 8:53 a.m. After reaching Saint Joseph, where he spent 39 minutes on the ground, Lt. Maughan experienced severe nausea from oil fumes on the next leg. He reached Cheyenne, however, where a broken oil line was found and soldered together. Approximately 90 minutes after leaving Cheyenne the oil line ruptured again and the nausea forced him to land at the air mail field at Rock Springs, Wyoming. 

The first two attempts had indicated that maximum performance was stressing the engine of the PW-8, necessitating that additional time be factored into the flight plan. With available daylight already reduced by a half hour by the date of the second attempt, no further tries were made in 1923.

Setting the record.
The next attempt was made using a different plane, serial number 24-204, the fourth PW-8 production aircraft. Curtiss modified it at its Long Island plant, removing its guns and mounts and increasing the 77-gallon fuel capacity by an additional 100 gallons.

Lt. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field at 3:58 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, June 23, 1924. He flew through intermittent rain and fog but still averaged 135 mph and reached McCook Field at Dayton at 8:10 a.m. EST. Although mechanics serviced the plane around in twenty minutes, one of the field's mechanics over-torqued the filler cap, securing it to the fuel intake housing and broke off the valve. The housing had to be removed, soldered, and replaced, costing an hour's delay.  

Lt. Maughan encountered thunderstorms between Dayton and St. Joseph, but reached Saint Joseph without incident. The grass field there was soft from heavy rain, limiting the takeoff weight of his plane. Unable to take on a full load of fuel, Lt. Maughan flew to North Platte, Nebraska, where he completely filled the fuel tank, but which caused a further 20-minute delay. 

The detour to North Platte also resulted in Lt. Maughan encountering a strong headwind, slowing his average groundspeed. He landed at the air mail field at Salduro Siding, a railroad stop adjacent to the Bonneville Salt Flats, at almost 6:30 p.m. local time and calculated that reaching San Francisco by dusk was still possible.

The last leg of the flight, over Nevada and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, was characterized by cloud strata, making navigation difficult in low light conditions. Lt. Maughan, from Logan, Utah, was familiar with the terrain however and recognized sufficient landmarks to approach San Francisco Bay from the north. He used a revolving light on Alcatraz Island to guide him to Crissy Field, the military airfield at the Presidio of San Francisco, where he landed in front of an estimated 50,000 spectators at 9:46 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, reportedly a minute before dusk.

Maughan's total flight time was 20 hours and 48 minutes. In addition to the publicity value of being the first transcontinental crossing within the hours of daylight, the flight established new records for time, distance, and average speed (128.37 mph) in trancontinental flights.

Roentgenium (IPA: , formerly Unununium) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Rg and atomic number 111 making it one of the super-heavy atoms. It is a synthetic element whose longest-lived isotope has a mass of 280 and a half-life of 3.6 seconds. Due to its presence in Group 11 it is a transition metal and so probably would appear as a heavy, solid, shiny metal. Due to the inert pair effect, it should be colored like gold. 

 History .
It was discovery by  Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Münzenber and their team working at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany on December 8, 1994. Only three atoms of it were observed (all 272Rg), by the fusion of bismuth-209 and nickel-64 in a linear accelerator. (Nickel was bombarded onto the bismuth target.)

The name roentgenium was accepted as a permanent name on November 1 2004 in honor of Wilhelm Röntgen; before this date, the element was known under the temporary IUPAC systematic element name unununium (IPA: , symbol Uuu). Some research has referred to it as eka-gold.

The official baptism took place at GSI, on Friday November 17 2006, in presence of Annette Schavan, the Federal German Minister of Research.

Isotopes.
Three isotopes of roentgenium are known.  The longest-lived of these is 280Rg which decays through alpha decay and has a half-life of 3.6 s.  The shortest-lived isotope is 272Rg which decays through alpha decay and has a half life of 1.5 ms. The other known isotope, 279Rg, decays through alpha decay and has a half-life of 170 ms.

Trivia.
The elements in Group 11 used to informally be called the coinage metals, due to their historical use in coins. It is unlikely that roentgenium can be used to make coins since all of its isotopes are radioactive with very short half-lives, and nothing has been invented to hold atoms together.

The Slave craton is a relatively small Archean craton (about 300,000 km²) located in the Northwest Territories of Canada. It is dominated by ca. 2.73-2.63 Ga greenstones and turbidite sequences and ca. 2.72-2.58 Ga plutonic rock, with large parts of the craton underlain by older gneiss and granitoid units. The Slave craton is a major component of the Canadian Shield and one of the most distinct and oldest building blocks of the North American cratonic lithosphere. The cratonic block extends from the Great Slave Lake at about 61 °N to Coronation Gulf on the Arctic Ocean at 69 °N. It covers longitudinally the area between about 105 °W to 117 °W. The Slave includes the Acasta Gneiss which is one of the oldest dated rock units on Earth at 4.03 Ga. 

The crust of the Slave craton is thought have amalgamated during a 2.69 Ga collision between a proto-Slave western basement complex, known as the Central Slave Basement Complex, and an eastern putative island arc terrane (Hackett River) along a N-S suture. Along the Acasta River, this basement complex yields protolith ages up to ca. 4.03 Ga, but apart from a central core with sporadic ages >3.5 Ga (Acasta to Point Lake), the Central Slave Basement Complex is mostly younger. Primary evidence for this lies in the N-S Pb and Nd isotope boundaries, and the apparent lack of old basement in the eastern Slave craton. From the several hundreds of kimberlites now known across the craton, the following ages have been recorded: Cambrian, Siluro-Ordovician, Permian, Jurassic, Cretacous, and Eocene. (Bleeker et al., 2004)

Origins of the proto-craton and continent formations.
Zircon crystals from the Acasta Gneiss have been radiometrically dated at 4.4 billion years. Rocks this old are thought to have been formed by mantle mafic-ultramafic and crustal acid magmatism. Parts of the Central Slave Basement Complex reveal quartzite gneiss that is similar to the quartzite found in the Southern Cross Province of the Yilgarn craton. A potential supercontinent predating 2.8 Ga is cautiously hypothesized. However, the variable age uncertainties of these Archean quartzite gneisses most probably reflect an overall distribution of a global 3.0-2.8 Ga quartzite peak, rather than a direct correlation between the two cratons. This peak likely reflects progressive growth and stabilization of continental crust toward the end of the Archaean. (Bleeker, 2000).

The Slave craton's amalgamation with the Rae craton (ca. 2.0 Ga) initiated the growth of Laurentia (2.0-1.8 Ga). Within a broader context, it originated from the breakup of the much larger late Archean parental supercraton Sclavia, and is a remnant of the supercontinent Nuna. As a mere fragment of ancient crust, surrounded by Paleoproterozoic rifted margins, it is also a remnant from the break-up of a much larger late Archean landmass of the supercontinent Kenorland. The late Archean and earliest Proterozoic development of Slave crust should thus be viewed in the context of this larger supercraton (Sclavia), even though the shape and size of this earlier supercraton is unknown. The salient point is that cratons like the Slave only preserve parts of the much larger tectonic systems in which they were generated.

Post-dating the assembly of Laurentia and Nuna, the Slave craton, particularly along its margins, became partially buried beneath intra-continental Proterozoic basins. At ca. 1.269-1.267 Ga, the craton was partly uplifted and intruded by the giant Mackenzie dyke swarm, radiating from a plume center west of Victoria Island. This is the last major event affecting the core of the craton, although some younger mafic magmatic events affect its edges (e.g. the ca. 780 Ma Hottah sheets). Since that time, Slave crust has been "bobbing" gently up and down, with interior seas expanding and receding across the craton. Ordovician and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks and fossils are known as wall rock fragments in some of the central Slave kimberlites. (Bleeker, 2006).

Despite the relative stability at the surface, melting events were triggered in the subcontinental mantle lithosphere, leaving their traces as clusters of kimberlites across the craton. From the several hundreds of kimberlites now known across the craton, the following ages have been recorded: Cambrian, Siluro-Ordovician, Permian, Jurassic, Cretacous, and the Eocene. (Bleeker, 2006).

Early Archean Central Slave Basement Complex. 
The central and western parts of the craton are underlain by a large Mesoarchean to Hadean basement: the Central Slave Basement Complex (>100,000 km²). Along the Acasta River, this basement complex consists of polymetamorphic gneisses of tonalitic to gabbroic composition that yield protolith ages up to ca. 4.03 Ga. Apart from a central core with sporadic ages >3.5 Ga (Acasta to Point Lake), the Central Slave Basement Complex is mostly younger with important age modes, from detrital and protolith U-Pb zircon ages, around 3.40 Ga, 3.15 Ga, 2.95 Ga and 2.826 Ga. Data from the mantle suggest that at least part of the lithospheric mantle below the central part of the craton may be of similar antiquity. Pre-2.9 Ga supracrustal rocks have been found at the base of some greenstone belts but form only a small component. (Bleeker, 2004). Sometime after 2.85 Ga, the nucleus of the Meso- and Paleoarchean sialic crust of the Central Slave Basement Complex experienced regional uplift followed by gradual subsidence giving rise, first, to craton-scale unconformity, then to the thin transgressive veneer of crossbedded, highly mature, quartzitic sediments. This uplift-subsidence cycle is attributed to a mantle plume that gave rise to a subaerial komatiite flow, now preserved in the detrital chromite grains in the quartzite units. Following this uplift-subsidence cycle, rifting of the thermally weakened crust resulted in voluminous outpouring of pillow basalt flows and intrusion of associated dyke swarms. Much of the craton was submerged at this time so there is little sedimentary evidence left of this rifting. (Bleeker et al., 2000).

Neoarchean basement complex and Central Slave Cover Group.
By at least 2.9 Ga, the basement complex formed a thin but widespread, ca. 2.9-2.8 Ga cover sequence of siliciclastic and sedimentary rocks <200 m. thick. The basement-cover contact represents a sheared and metamorphosed unconformity. The overall topology of the greenstone belts in the western and central Slave province permits all quartzite and banded iron formations to be correlated into a single cover sequence. This lateral correlation is supported by the lithostratigraphic similarities that exist over distances of several hundred kilometers. The most distinctive lithologies are the detrital-chromite-bearing fuchsitic quartzite and thin banded iron formations that mark the onset of the Neoarchean cycle of supracrustal development.

The supermature and commonly fuchsitic quartzites mark the emergence and erosional unroofing of the basement complex in what was probably a CO2-rich atmosphere. Abundant detrital chromite suggest contemporaneous komatiitic volcanism. Similar fuchsitic quartzite sequences occur in many other cratons worldwide, particularly between ca. 3.1 Ga and 2.8 Ga. All the fuchsite in the quartzite units are considered to be the product of mica-producing metamorphic reactions during the shearing and considered to reflect detrital chromite input. In many localities fuchsitic orthoquartzite are intercalated with other clastic rocks such as polymict conglomerate and impure, mica-rich, flaggy quartzite. Pelitic schist occurs between the quartzite rocks and banded iron formation suggesting a progressive deepening of the depositional environment and trangressive migration of the shoreline. In most cases, the banded iron formations are capped with a thin sulfidic chert layer and then abruptly overlain with massive to pillowed basaltic flows. Highly magnesian mafic/ultramafic lavas have been observed at or near the base of the pillow basalt sequence (Bleeker et al., 2000). After 2.4 Ga, mature quartzites are rarely fuchsitic. The cover sequence itself is overlain by 2.73 to 2.63 Ga greenstone belts.

The Neoarchean supracrustal sequence is heavily intruded and cannibalized by plutonic suites ranging in age from 2.72-2.670 Ga synvolcanic plutons to 2.59-2.58 Ga late-orogenic batholithic granites. The supracrustal sequences, collectively known as the Yellowknife Supergroup, are represented by an early cover sequence comprising quartzite and banded iron formation (ca. 2.80 Ga), a thick dominantly tholeiitic greenstone sequence (ca. 2.70 Ga), younger arc-like sequences (ca. 2.69-2.61 Ga), extensive turbidite blankets (ca. 2.68-2.62 Ga), and finally syn-orogenic conglomerates deposited at ca. 2.60 Ga or shortly thereafter. The early cover sequence and the overlying tholeiites represent subaerial exposure and then volcanic-dominated rifting of the basement. Arc-like sequences formed in part on top of the attenuated basement and in progressively widening, juvenile, back-arc-like basins and contain some of Canada's largest undeveloped volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits. After 2.68 Ga, much of the Slave craton became overlain by the Burwash Basin, one of the largest and best-preserved Archean turbidite basins in the world, comparable in size and setting to the Japan Sea. During orogenesis, the supracrustal sequences were telescoped, thickened, and multiply folded between ca. 2.65 and 2.58 Ga, with a peak in crustal anatexis between 2.59-2.58 ga (the "granite bloom"). Numerous orogenic gold deposits formed throughout the Slave craton, either as shear- or vein-hosted deposits in deformed greenstones or within the chemical traps provided by banded iron formations in the turbidites. (Bleeker, 2004).

The Central Slave Cover Group hosts some of the more prominent banded iron formations (BIF) of the Slave craton, although most are thin (1-10 m) and variable in composition along strike, changing from oxide iron formation into silicate-rich varieties or merely ferruginous chert. Locally, however, folding has thickened the highly magnetic BIF into substantial thicknesses (e.g., at Amacher Lake, on the eastern flank of the Sleepy Dragon Complex), resulting in some of the highest amplitude total field magnetic anomalies in the Slave craton. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.73-2.66 Ga volcanism.
Wherever the thin cover sequence is recognized, it is overlain by a thick and extensive sequence of tholeiitic basalts, with minor komatiite and rhyolite tuff intercalations. In the Yellowknife greenstone belt, this basalt-dominated volcanic sequence is known as the Kam Group. Possible correlative basalt successions are known across the basement domain, as far east as the Courageous Lake belt, and at least as far north as around the Exmouth antiform in the Acasta area. This basalt sequence typically consists of several hundred meters to several kilometres of pillowed and massive flows, with thin felsic horizons, and intruded by numerous dykes and sills of several generations. (Bleeker, 2006).

Although these lavas extruded in a subaqueous environment, regional correlations suggest a basalt sequence approaching LIP proportions (areal distribution >100,000 km², typical thickness 1-6 km). Stratigraphy, dense dyke swarms, and isotopic data link this basalt sequence to the basement. Well-dated components of this widespread basalt-dominated sequence yield ages from 2.734 Ga to 2.697 Ga. The widespread basaltic volcanism probably accompanied rifting of the basement complex, possibly assisted by mantle plume activity. From a mantle perspective, it seems inconceivable that events associated with the voluminous basaltic volcanism recorded across the ancient basement terrain did not involve thinning or at least modification of the lithospheric mantle below the Central Slave Basement Complex. Large-scale melting was probably triggered by adiabatic rise of asthenospheric mantle. Perhaps, then, the ca. 2.7 Ga basaltic volcanism may have contributed to the highly depleted mantle compositions underlying the core of the craton. (Bleeker, 2006).

Post-2.70 Ga volcanism.
Following ca. 2.7 Ga basaltic volcanism and rifting, most areas in the Slave craton show a transition to calc-alkaline volcanism characterized by abundant felsic and intermediate volcanic rocks, calc-alkaline basaltic rocks, and intercalated volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks. In nearly all areas, these arc-like rocks are stratigraphically overlain by turbiditic sedimentary rocks. Ages for the arc-like volcanic rocks are typically in the range of 2.69-2.66 Ga.

The ca. 2.7 Ga rifting and basaltic volcanism initiated a complex sequence of events including craton-wide, 2.69-2.66 Ga, typically calc-alkalic volcanism and sub-volcanic intrusive activity. These largely juvenile arc-like rocks dominate the eastern part of the craton, while in the central and western part they stratigraphically overlie basement and its basaltic cover. Hence, the most likely setting appears an arc- or back arc-like environment that was constructed on highly extended continental crust. The craton-scale stratigraphic relationships and lack of a suture do not easily support models that invoke collision of an exotic, juvenile arc terrane. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.68-2.66 Ga sedimentation. 
Starting at ca. 2680 Ma, a broad turbidite basin-the Burwash Basin-developed across much of the craton and progressively buried the volcanic substrate. A persistence of volcanic intercalations up-section and late mafic sill complexes suggest a volcanically active extensional setting, perhaps best compared with modern back-arcs. The minimum size of this basin was ca. 400x800 km, comparable to that of the Japan Sea, and making it the largest and possibly best-preserved Archean turbidite basin in the world. Like the Japan Sea, the Burwash Basin was largely ensialic, in agreement with inferences by early workers. 

The Burwash Basin fill consists largely of immature greywackes and mudstones, deposited below wave base, and may locally be up to 10 km thick. Intercalated tuff layers have been dated at ca. 2.661 Ga. Across the Slave craton, the greywacke turbidites have been given different formational names: the classical Burwash Formation in the Yellowknife Domain; the Contwoyto Formation in central and northern Slave, identical in essentially all aspects to the Burwash Formation further south, except for the presence of intercalated iron formations; the Itchen Formation, a more mud-rich facies in the north-central Slave; and the Beechey Lake Group in the northeastern Slave. 

Many of the turbidite beds, particularly those of the Burwash and Contwoyto Formation, are sand dominated with only thin silt to mud sections at the top of the graded beds. In the Yellowknife Domain, thick amalgamated sand beds (2-10 m) are not unusual. Petrography, detrital zircons, and geochemical analysis indicate that the greywacke detritus consists of a mixture of mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and uplifted plutonic infrastructure, with only minor input from ancient basement rocks. The main axis of the basin and subsequent structural trends appear to have been northeast-southwest, distinctly across the north-south isotopic boundaries that track the nature of deep basement. This interpretation is based on the following observations: 

Identical Burwash Formation turbidites extend from the near Yellowknife area to the northeastern Slave. Banded iron formations in the turbidites are restricted to the northwest half of the craton, suggesting a northeast-southwest facies boundary or tectonic trend across the basin. Earliest folds in the turbidites, which formed between 2.65-2.63 Ga, have northeasterly trends after qualitative "unfolding" of younger fold generations. Early folds appear to form a systematic northeast-southwest trending fold belt. 
The earliest plutonic suite that intrudes folded Burwash strata, the ca. 2.63 Ga Defeat Suite, appears to form a northeast-southwest-trending magmatic belt across the southeastern half of the craton. With more and better U-Pb zircon ages, a tentative "volcanic line" of 2.661 Ga felsic volcanic complexes, coeval with turbidite sedimentation, has begun to emerge. This volcanic line also trends northeast-southwest and may represent the first recognition of a linear arc system. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.65-2.63 Ga closure of the Burwash Basin.
Subsequent tectonic events record the closure and folding of the Burwash Basin across the southern Slave craton with turbidite sedimentation sometime before 2.65 Ga. The latter age constraint is provided by early plutons of the Defeat Suite, a distinct and possibly subduction-related magmatic suite across the southern-southeastern Slave craton. Closure of the highly extended, but largely ensialic back-arc basin allowed considerable shortening and mobility but with a structural style dominated, at least at high structural levels, by fairly systematic, mostly upright, northeast-southwest trending fold trains. At deeper levels, e.g. along the basement-cover interface, the fold trains must have been detached allowing differential shortening of the basement and cover.

The folded Burwash strata do not represent an outboard accretionary prism (which would require a trench setting rather than the more likely back-arc setting), and there is no evidence for a discrete "Contwoyto terrane." The northeast-southwest structural grain of the fold belt is also recognized in the lithospheric mantle. Shallow subduction  may have emplaced distinct mantle slabs. These processes terminated with docking of an outboard terrane, either in the southeast or the northwest; but this terrane is not preserved, however, within the exposed Slave craton. Crustal thickening led to uplift and erosional exhumation of folded Burwash strata and the unroofing of Defeat Suite plutons. Detrital zircons of Defeat Suite age are recorded in younger sedimentary packages. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.63 Ga turbidites.
2.63 Ga turbidites exist along the northwestern margin of the craton and record a migration of tectonic activity to the northwest. Deposition was coeval with uplift and erosional unroofing of Defeat plutons and the tightly folded Burwash Formation strata. Shortly following their deposition, these younger turbidites were shortened and intruded by ca. 2.616-2.609 Ga tonalite-granodiorite plutons of the Concession suite. (Bleeker, 2004). 

In the multiply folded, metamorphosed, and intermittently exposed terrain of the western Slave craton, it has proven difficult to distinguish these younger turbiditic greywackes from Burwash Basin turbidites. There is no sharply defined demarcation line that separates the two turbidite packages and recognition of the younger sequence relies largely on the absence of Defeat Suite-age plutons and the presence of <2.64 Ga detrital zircons. Preliminary work suggests that the younger turbidite sequence contains abundant intercalated iron formations, mostly of silicate facies, those of the Damoti Lake area representing one of the more significant examples. Many of the iron formations are "lean", comprising background turbiditic greywacke variably enriched in metamorphic garnet, other Fe-rich silicates, and/or disseminated sulphides. 

A distinct, post-Burwash Basin, greywacke and/or volcaniclastic sediment package, associated with felsic volcanic rocks and subvolcanic intrusions, and dated at approximately 2.716-2.712 Ga, occurs along the tightly folded synclinal core of the High Lake greenstone belt of the northern Slave craton. This package is of significance in that it is one of the few examples of a preserved volcano-sedimentary carapace to one of the major plutonic suites, i.e. the coeval Concession Suite. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.60-2.59 Ga final orogeny.
Starting at ca. 2.6 Ga, the entire craton was affected by cross-folding and significant further shortening, characterized by broadly north-south structural trends, and probably in response to final collision along a distant active margin of Sclavia. Moderate overthickening of the crust led to HT-LP metamorphism, widespread anatexis, the appearance of S-type granites, and a hot and weak lower crust, culminating in ca. 2.59-2.58 Ga extension and the regional  granite bloom . The intrusion of carbonatites and involvement of other mantle-derived melts indicate a role for mantle processes (possible delamination). While peak temperatures were attained in the lower crust, large basement-cored domes were amplified by buoyancy driven deformation; lower crustal devolatilization reactions mobilized gold-bearing fluids; and syn-orogenic clastic basins formed and were immediately infolded into tight synclines. At least one of these syn-orogenic clastic basins formed as late as ca. 2.58 Ga. Late strike-slip faulting overprinted and truncated the synclinally infolded clastic basins. This event in the craton's evolution transferred, irreversibly, a significant fraction of heat-producing elements and lower crustal fluids to the upper crust, thus allowing cooling and stiffening of the lower crust and setting the stage for cratonization and long-term preservation. When the lower crust cooled and coupled with the mantle, the Slave (within Sclavia) finally became a craton. (Bleeker, 2004).

Northern Slave province, Acasta Gneiss and Point Lake greenstone belt.
The Acasta Gneiss is a rock outcrop of Archaean tonalite gneiss located in the western section of the northern Slave province, just west of the Emile River. The rock exposed in the outcrop formed at 4.03 Ga and is the earliest known rock to have survived intact from the Earth's early crust. Plutonic activity occurred in the underlying basement of the Acasta area at ca. 3.4 Ga. and the overlying quartzite and banded iron formation of the Acasta Gneiss Complex ar dated at 2.8 Ga. This cover sequence is conformably overlain by pillow basalt flows, and in turn by metaturbidite units. This conformably overlying strata is part of the Archaen Yellowknife Supergroup. However, as part of the Central Slave Cover Group, the Acasta gneisses are unconformably overlain by the fuchsitic quartzite, firmly placing the Earth's oldest rocks within the old cratonic nucleus of the Slave Province prior to deposition of the ca. 2.8 Ga quartzite units. The ca. 4.0 Ga rocks of the Acasta River area forms an ancient enclave in a polycyclic heterogeneous gneiss terrane that trends around the Emile River sycline east to the Point Lake gneiss domain. 

To the east of the Acasta Gneiss lies the Point Lake greenstone belt. Quartzite and a banded iron formation sequence is found beneath the belt and below a small outlying greenstone belt to the west of Point Lake near the Greenville Lake basement complex. Gneissic rocks in the Point Lake area are separated from the gneisses in the Acasta area to the west by the Emile River supracrustal belt. The Emile River belt comprises two marginal greenstone belts of deformed pillowed basalt sequences. 
(Bleeker et al., 2000).

Eastern Slave province, Back River Volcanic Complex.
The following study is by Breeman et al. (2001): The Black River Volcanic Complex is an Archaean (2.708 to ca. 2.66 Ga) stratovolcano that lies 480 km. northeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. It constitutes the Back Group of the Yellowknife Supergroup and is somewhat anomalous in the Slave craton because it has undergone only a low degree of deformation and is subhorizontal. The southern half of the complex is exposed at the crest of a small dome. This is the eroded portion of the stratovolcano that has been preserved in an upright position. The complex comprises four volcanic sedimentary sequences (Innerring, Thlewyco, Boucher-Regan, Kelsh) that correspond to the phases of growth and destruction of this stratovolcano. 

The Innerring sequence, which constitutes the oldest rocks of the complex, represents the upper part of an eroded early phase of the volcano (U-Pb zircon igneous age of 2.708 Ga). The Thlewyco sequence represents the main construction phase of the volcano and forms an outward dipping, annular succession around the Innerring sequence, with an aggregate thickness of 2500-5000 meters. Its stratigraphy changes dramatically around the crator, varying from five cycles of andesitic and rhylotic lava, followed by succession of volcanistic debris on the north side; to 30 subarial andesitic flowqs and rare pyroclastic and epivolcaniclastic units on the eastern side; to interlayered dacitic and andesitic lava and tuff overlain by a thick succession of voluminous, nonwelded, ash-flow tuff and volcaniclastic rocks on the south side. Volcanism in this sequence ended with the eruption of large rhyolite and dacite dome-flow complexes (U-Pb zircon dated at 2.692 Ga). The Innerring and Thlewycho sequences represent a complex history of explosive erruptions from numerous eruptive centers.

The Boucher-Regan sequence, with its predominance of pillowed lava flows, suggests that this northern-flank of the volcano was submerged during deposition. The Kelsh sequence on the northwestern side comprises epiclastic volcarenite, rhyolite-dacite block breccia from lava domes, polymict breccia, and a conglomerate of andesite, dacite-rhyolite clasts, and andesitic tuff. The exposed succession consists of iron-formation, oolitic-stromatolitic carbonate, sulphidic volcaniclastic rocks and graphitic slate that marks the end of volcanism. The Kelsh sequence forms a broad apron that is interpreted as a shallow, sunmarine to subaerial, clastic fan derived by degradation of the volcanic pile (U-Pb zircon dated at 2.586 Ga). (Breeman et al., 2001). 

Age determinations in the Black River complex are similar to the ages of volcanic rock found in the upper Kam Group of the Yellowknife greenstone belt as well as other volcanic centers in the western Slave province. Detrital zircon geochronology on turbiditic sequences confirm a secondary deposition of turbidite units at ca. 2.62-2.60 Ga that was widespread throughout the Slave province. (Breeman et al., 2001).

Southern Slave province, Yellowknife greenstone belt.
The Yellowknife greenstone belts consists of crossbedded orthoquartzite, together with >3.0 Ga gneissic xenoliths that cut through the belt. U/Pb geochronologic data of the greenstone belt and the adjacent granitoid rocks confirm that some of the granitoid rocks below the greenstone belt represent old basement. Plutonic activity occurred in the underlying basement at ca. 2.95 Ga. Detrital zircons in the quartzite north of Yellowknife have been dated at >3.9 Ga. (Bleeker et al., 2000). Seafloor hydrothermal deposits and alteration and minor sulphide mineralization occurs in the Yellowknife belt (e.g., the Homer Lake showing, and horizons northeast of Bell Lake). Neoarchean bimodal rift volcanic rocks overlie faulted basement in the basal greenstones of the Yellowknife belt.

The late Archean stratigraphy in Yellowknife is compatible with the rifting interpretation outlined above in the "Post-2.70 Ga volcanism" section of this article. In Yellowknife, the top of the sequence is represented by voluminous basaltic flows and intercalated felsic volcanic rocks of the Yellowknife Bay Formation, dated at ca. 2.7 Ga. In support of the overall regional correlation, similar ca. 2.7 Ga ages have been obtained from Courageous Lake and Acasta areas. Stratigraphy, dense dyke swarms, and isotopic data link the basalt sequence to the basement. At the top of the Kam Group, bimodal volcanic rocks of the Yellowknife Bay Formation become progressively more intercalated with volcaniclastic sediments, before final intrusion by thick tholeiitic sills. One of these sills, the Kam Point gabbro sill, has a preliminary baddeleyite age of ca. 2.697 Ga. (Bleeker, 2006).

For the Burwash Formation of the Yellowknife Domain refer to the above "Ca. 2.68-2.66 Sedimentation" section of this article.

Economic geology.
Proterozoic rift-related magmatic suites and arcs around the margins of the craton host a variety of mineral deposits, and several hundred Phanerozoic kimberlites support Canada's first diamond mines. Geologic interest has been renewed in the craton by the discoveries of kimberlite diamond occurrences in the region. The Eocene (ca. 55-50 Ma) kimberlite pipes of the Lac de Gras area in the central Slave craton now support two highly profitable diamond mines, Ekati and Diavik. Several other diamond mines are in various stages of development. In just over a decade, diamonds have become the most profitable commodity within this ancient craton.

The banded iron formations (BIFs) of the Slave craton appear to be of low economic value, although some may possibly host epigenetic gold mineralization and may be underexplored. However, most iron formation-hosted gold mineralization appears to be associated with BIFs hosted in low to medium-grade turbidite packages. However, the Burwash Formation metaturbidites and the Yellowknife greenstone belt do have epigenetic gold mineralization. Epigenetic gold mineralization throughout the Slave craton were caused by deformation and associated metamorphism. In the Yellowknife greenstone belt, it led to formation of the ca. 15 million ounce Con-Giant Au deposit, along a complex system of mostly reverse shear zones. As is typical for this class of deposits, the Con-Giant system occurs mostly within moderate to strongly deformed basaltic rocks, in proximity to a regional stratigraphic break, the Yellowknife River Fault Zone. An asymmetric synclinal panel of syn-orogenic conglomerates (the Jackson Lake Formation) occurs along this fault zone. Identical relationships are observed in several other major Archean gold camps, most notably Timmins, Kirkland Lake, and Kalgoorlie. The critical control common to all these camps is localization of Au mineralization within significant bends of the regional fault zones; these bends were most likely dilational during emplacement of the gold-bearing quartz veins. 

Although numerous other volcanic-hosted gold vein systems are known from the Slave craton, some of which were briefly in production in the past, only one other major camp has emerged in recent years. This camp occurs in the Hope Bay belt, on the Coronation Gulf coast of the Slave craton, and consists of a string of deposits (Boston, Doris, Madrid) that are being readied for production. Elsewhere, despite significant past exploration, overall potential for this class of deposits remains excellent. Several greenstone belts throughout the Slave craton have very similar structural-stratigraphic characteristics to that of the Yellowknife belt, including a thick, folded turbidite pile adjacent to a basaltic greenstone belt, a regional deformation zone, and a young conglomerate package. Best examples are the Point Lake and Arcadia Bay areas. (Bleeker, 2006).

Another class of mineral deposits related to final orogenesis is that of rare-element enriched granitoids, particularly highly evolved anatectic granites and their pegmatites. Tin (cassiterite) and Li (spodumene) were briefly mined from such pegmatites in the Yellowknife Domain, but other pegmatite fields are known throughout the Slave craton. From a global metallogeny point of view, these occurrences are of interest as they typically correlate with ancient, multiply recycled, felsic crust. (Bleeker, 2006).

Fuchsitic quartzites below the iron formations are enriched in detrital minerals, including highly stable heavy minerals such as chromite, zircon, and rutile. Individual, dark, detrital chromite grains are a characteristic feature of these otherwise white to grey quartzites. Commonly, these chromite grains have undergone variable reaction towards bright green fuchsitic mica during metamorphism and deformation. In a few localities, chromites are concentrated in seams of "black sand", but clearly such concentrations are too small to be of economic interest. If road access were available, some of the green-white quartzite would make attractive building or decorative stone. In Greenland, India, and Australia, similar quartzites are often quarried for this purpose. Elsewhere in the world, quartzites similar to these contain paleoplacer deposits of gold and/or uranium. (Bleeker, 2006).

The North American A-36A Apache/Invader was the ground-attack/dive-bomber version of the North American P-51 Mustang, from which it could be distinguished by the presence of rectangular, slatted dive brakes above and below the wings. A total of 500 A-36A dive bombers served in North Africa, the Mediterranean, Italy and the China-Burma-India theater during World War II before being withdrawn from operational use in 1944.

Design and development.
With the introduction of the North American Mustang I with the RAF Army Co-operation Squadrons in February 1942, the new fighter began combat missions as a low-altitude reconnaissance and ground-support aircraft. Supplementing the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks already in service, Mustang Is were first supplied to No. 26 Squadron RAF, then rapidly deployed to ten additional squadrons by June 1942. Drawing first blood over Dieppe on 19 August 1942, a No. 414 (RCAF) Squadron Mustang downed the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the first victory for a Mustang.  Despite the limiting high-altitude performance of the Allison V-1710 engine, the RAF was enthusiastic about its new mount which "performed magnificently ."

During the Mustang I's successful combat initiation, North American's president Howard "Dutch" Kindelberger pressed the newly redesignated USAAF US Army Air Force for a fighter contract for the essentially similar P-51, 47 of which had passed into the USAAF when the Lend-Lease contract with Britain ran out of funds. The P-51 utilized four 20 mm wing cannons replacing the original four .30 caliber and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns mounted in the wings and two .50 caliber "chin" machine guns. No funds were available for new fighter contracts in Fiscal Year 1942 but General Oliver Echols wanted to ensure the P-51 remained in production. 

Since appropriations were available for an attack aircraft, Echols specified modifications to the P-51 to turn it into a dive bomber. The contract for 500 A-36A aircraft fitted with bomb racks and dive brakes was in place (16 April 1942)  even before the first flight of the P-51 in May 1942.  With orders on the books, North American Aviation (NAA) began modifying the P-51 to accept the bomb shackles that were already tested in a "long-range ferry" program that the RAF had stipulated . Engineering studies totalling 40,000 hours and wind tunnel testing with a 1/8 scale model was completed in June 1942. Utilizing the basic P-51 airframe and Allison engine, structural reinforcing  "beefed up" several high stress areas and "a set of hydraulically operated dive brakes were installed in each main wing plane."  Due to the slightly inboard placement of the bomb racks and unique installation of four cast aluminum dive brakes, a complete redesign of the P-51 wing was required. 

The USAAF also had 310 P-51As on order that  were differentiated by having provision for drop tanks, an armament of only four, wing-mounted 0.50 in Browning machine guns and an Allison V-1710-81 1200 hp (91248 kgM). Like the A-36A, the P-51A was fitted with bomb racks but was not intended for use primarily as a fighter-bomber. 

The first A-36A (42-83663) was rolled out of the NAA Inglewood plant in September 1942, rapidly going through flight testing with the first flight in October and deliveries commencing soon after of the first production machines. The A-36A continued the use of nose-mounted .50 caliber machine guns along with wing armament of four .50 caliber machine guns. Another major alteration was the use of a sea level-rated Allison V-1710-87 that delivered 1325 hp at 3000 ft but had greatly reduced output above 12,000 ft. 

Operational service. 

The A-36A-1NA ("Apache," the A-36A's official name was rarely used) joined the 27th Fighter Bomber Group composed of four squadrons based at Rasel Ma in French Morocco in April 1943 during North Africa . The 27th had a mixed component of Douglas A-20 Havocs and A-36As while the second operational unit, the 86th Fighter Bomber Group (Dive) arrived in March 1943 with the first pilots trained and qualified on the A-36A.  On 6 June 1943, both of these A-36A units flew combat missions directed against the island of Pantelleria. The island fell to Allied attack and became the home base for the two A-36A groups during the invasion of Sicily. The A-36A proved to be a potent weapon; it could be put into a vertical dive at 12,000 ft, deploying its dive brakes, limiting the dive speed to 390 mph. Pilots soon recognized that extending the dive brakes after "peel-off" led to some unequal extension of the brakes due to varying hydraulic pressure, setting up an invariable slight roll which impeded aiming. Proper technique soon cured this anomaly and, subsequently, pilots achieved extremely consistent results.  Depending on the target and defences, the bomb release took place between 2,000 ft and 4,000 ft, followed by an immediate sharp "pull up." 

Dive brakes in the wings gave the A-36A greater stability in a dive, but a myth had arisen that they were useless due to malfunctions or because of the danger of deploying them and that they should be wired closed.  Capt. Charles E. Dills, 27th Fighter Bomber Group, 522nd Squadron, XIIth Air Force emphatically stated in a postwar interview: "I flew the A-36 for 39 of my 94 missions, from 11/43 to 3/44. They were never wired shut in Italy in combat. This "wired shut" story apparently came from the training group at Harding Field, Baton Rouge, LA." 

However, tactical reconnaissance training with P-51 and A-36 aircraft had delivered some disquieting accident rates. At one time, A-36 training had resulted in the type having "the highest accident rate per hour's flying time" of any USAAF aircraft. The most serious incident involved an A-36A shedding both wings when its pilot tried to pull out from a 450 mph dive.  Combat units flying the A-36A were ordered to restrict their approach to a 70° "glide" attack and refrain from using dive brakes.  This order was generally ignored by experienced pilots but some units did wire dive brakes shut until modifications were made to the hydaulic actuators. Nevertheless, the A-36 was used with great success as a dive-bomber, acquiring a reputation for precision, sturdiness and silence.

By late May 1943, 300 A-36As had been deployed to the Mediterranean Theater, with many of the first batch sent to the 27th to re-build the group following losses as well as completing the final transition to an all-A-36A unit. Both groups were actively involved in air support during the Sicilian campaign, becoming especially adept at "mopping" up enemy gun positions and other strong points as the Allies advanced. During this operation, the 27th Group circulated a petition to adopt the name "Invader" for their rugged little bomber, receiving unofficial recognition of the more fitting name.  Despite the name change, most combat reports preferred the name "Mustang" for all of the variants.  The Germans gave it a flattering if fearsome accolade, calling the A-36As, "screaming helldivers." 

Besides dive bombing, the A-36A racked up aerial victores totalling 84 enemy aircraft and an "ace," Lieutenant Michael T. Russo from the 27th Fighter Bomber Group (ultimately, the only ace using the Allison-engined Mustang).   As fighting intensified in all theaters where the A-36A operated, the dive bomber began to suffer an alarming loss rate with 177 falling to enemy action.  The main reason for the attrition was the hazardous missions that placed the A-36A "on the deck" facing murderous ground fire. German defences in southern Italy included placing cables across hill tops to snare the attacking A-36As.  Despite establishing a "reputation for reliability and performance," the one "Achilles' heel" of the A-36A (and the Mustang) remained its vulnerable cooling system leading to many of the losses.  By June 1944, A-36As in Europe were replaced by Curtiss P-40s and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts . 

A-36As had also served with the 311th Fighter Bomber Group in the China-Burma-India theater. The 311th had arrived in Dinjan, India by late summer 1943 after being shipped across the Pacific via Australia.  Two squadrons were equipped with the A-36A while the third flew P-51As. Tasked with reconaissance, dive bombing, attack and fighter missions, the A-36A was outclassed by its main oppossion, the Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa, codenamed "Oscar." The light and highly agile Japanese fighter could outfly the A-36A at all altitudes but did have some weak points- it was lightly armed and offered little protection for pilot or fuel tanks. However, the A-36A fought at a significant disadvantage, having to carry out long-range missions often at altitudes above the "Hump" that meant its Allison engine was below peak performance. In a fighter escort mission over Burma, three A-36As were lost without scoring a single victory. The A-36A CBI missions continued throughout 1943-1944 with indifferent results. The A-36A remained in service in small numbers throughout the remaining year of the war, some being retained in the US as training aircraft. 
Legacy.
"The type's relatively brief service life should not camouflage the fact that it made a major contribution to the Allied war effort"  especially in the Mediterranean and it amounted to the first USAAF combat use of a Mustang variant.

Survivors.
Relatively few A-36As survived the war and the subsequent postwar retirement and scrapping of obsolete types. One A-36A, bearing race number #44, owned and flown by Kendall Everson, was entered in the 1947 Kendall Trophy Race. The old warhorse was able to reach 377.926 mph, finishing second to the winning P-51D flown by Steve Beville.  

A-36A (USAAF Serial #42-83665/N39502) is on display as "Margie H" at the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, Ohio. There are at least three A-36s undergoing restoration. The Warhawk Air Museum in Caldwell, Indiana has A-36A (USAAF Serial #42-83738/N4607V) under restoration for future display. A-36As currently under restoration to flying condition include the A-36A (USAAF Serial #42-83731/N251A) owned by Tom Friedkin in Chino, California (presently being refurbished at the Planes of Fame Museum after her return from the Flying Legends 2002 Air Display at Duxford) and the Collings Foundation A-36A being restored in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.

<doc id="2528904" title="Mike Mordecai" nonfiltered="77" processed="76" dbindex="1480077">
Michael Howard Mordecai (born December 13, 1967 in Birmingham, Alabama) is a right-handed hitting infielder in Major League Baseball who most recently played for the Florida Marlins.

School and minor leagues.
Mordecai graduated from Hewitt Trussville High School, Trussville, Alabama in 1986 where he played baseball, basketball and football.  For the next three years he attended University of South Alabama and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame on April 27, 2001.  During his time at South Alabama, he was a two-time All-American and named to the All-Sun Belt Conference team each year.  In 1987, he helped the Jaguars to the conference title.  Mordecai majored in criminal justice and minored in sociology. 

With their sixth round selection of the 1989 MLB Draft, the Atlanta Braves drafted Mordecai. He began his minor league career at Class A Burlington and eventually worked his way up to Greenville. In 1992, he made his way to AAA Richmond on June 19. In 1993, he was selected as Richmond's Most Competitive Player. He played every defensive position with the exception of center field and pitcher that season.

Atlanta and a championship.
In 1994, Mordecai made it to the majors but only for four at bats. His first tour was from May 3-20, when he replaced Jeff Blauser on the roster. Mordecai's first hit was a game-winning three-run home run in the ninth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. He received the John M. Zwack III Memorial Award for being the most community-minded player.

Mordecai was a key cog in the 1995 World Series team as he provided depth on the bench. He made his first start at second on July 16 at San Diego. In the NLDS he went 2-for-3 with a double and 2 RBI. His pinch-hit single in the ninth inning of Game 2 gave the Braves the go-ahead run. In the World Series, he went 1-for-3.

Unfortunately for Mordecai, the Braves had Mark Lemke at second base, Chipper Jones at third and Fred McGriff at first preventing him from getting more than a reserve role with the team.  Mordecai was the Braves' starting third baseman on opening day though as Chipper Jones sat out with an injury.  On August 30, he collected the first three-hit game of his career at Chicago.

Montreal.
Mordecai's inability to stay consistent while a member of the Braves frustrated the front office and, in 1998, he joined the Montreal Expos.  Mordecai made 53 starts the next year.  He then enjoyed his best seasons there in 2000 and 2001.  On April 2, 2001, Mordecai demonstrated his versatility by playing catcher in the tenth inning of a game against the Cubs after Montreal's first catcher, Michael Barrett, was ejected and their second catcher, Sandy Martínez, was injured.

Florida and another championship.
In the midst of the 2002 trade deadline, Mordecai was hitting poorly for Montreal and was traded to the Florida Marlins.  His statistics for the season drastically improved after the trade. The following season, he was again a key part in helping the inexperienced Marlins win the 2003 World Series.  In Game 6 of the NLCS, the Marlins were five outs away from being eliminated when Cubs fan, Steve Bartman, derailed his team by preventing a foul ball from being an out.  Mordecai's three-run double blew the game open highlighting the Cubs' subsequent historic collapse in what is sometimes referred to as simply "The Inning".  Despite his heroics, it was Mordecai's last appearance of the season as he didn't play in the World Series.

On June 1, 2004, Mordecai again filled the role as emergency catcher, this time for eight innings after Ramón Castro was injured.

Mordecai took a job as manager with the Marlins minor league affiliate Jamestown Jammers in December 2004.  A few days later, the team announced that they would give him a chance to join the team in September so he could reach ten years of Major League service.

Mordecai was married on February 5 2000 and his wife, Jennifer, gave birth to son Jackson on August 2 that year. He also has a daughter, Taylor Mae, who was born on April 27 1995.

<doc id="2585864" title="Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh" nonfiltered="78" processed="77" dbindex="1480078">
Harold Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh, PC (27 March 1919   3 September 1996) was a prominent British politician of the Conservative Party, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 39 of the 42 years between 1950 and 1992. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1960.  He was created a life peer upon his retirement from the House of Commons in 1992. For three decades, he was a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club.

Family and education.
Amery's father was Leo Amery, the prominent British statesman and Conservative politician.

One of Julian's brothers, John, was a dedicated anti-Communist, and was hanged for treason by the British government at the end of World War II for having gone to Germany, joined the Nazis, and organized the British Free Corps to fight alongside the Germans against the Soviet Union.

Julian Amery was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. On 26 January 1950, he married Catherine Macmillan, a daughter of Harold Macmillan, though politically Amery was at odds with the elder Macmillan. Julian and Catherine had one son and three daughters.  Julian was widowed in 1991.

Military service.
Before World War II started, Amery was a war correspondent in the Spanish Civil War and later an attaché for the British Foreign Office in Belgrade. After the war began, he served in both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Army, eventually reaching the rank of Captain. He spent most of the war in the eastern Mediterranean (the Middle East, Malta, Yugoslavia), and served as Liaison Officer to the Albanian Resistance Movement in 1944. The following year, he went to China to work with General Carton de Wiart, then Prime Minister's Personal Representative to Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek.

Political career.
Amery won a Parliamentary seat in the first general election held after he returned to civilian life, in 1950. He was elected as the Conservative MP for Preston North, a seat he held until 1966. 

While sitting for Preston North, Amery held a number of government offices, all in governments led by his father-in-law, now the Prime Minister. He began with two Under-Secretaryships of State: for War (1957-1958) and for the Colonies (1958-1960). He was then promoted to Secretary of State for Air (1960-1962), followed by a promotion to the Cabinet post of Minister of Aviation (1962-1964).

Amery lost his seat in 1966, but was elected again in 1969 for Brighton Pavilion, a seat he would hold until 1992, when he retired and was created a life peer as Baron Amery of Lustleigh, of Preston in the County of Lancashire and of Brighton in the County of East Sussex.

Under the Heath ministry, Amery held three sub-Cabinet posts: Minister for Public Works (1970-1972), Minister for Housing and Construction (1970-1972), and Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1972-1974).

Monday Club.
For 30 years Julian Amery was an active member and later a Patron of the Conservative Monday Club, where he became friendly with General Sir Walter Walker, subsequently writing the foreword for Walker's anti-Soviet book, The Next Domino. He had been Guest of Honour at the Club's Annual Dinner at the Cutlers' Hall, in 1963. In 1965, he wrote the foreword for Club activist Geoffrey Stewart-Smith's book, No Vision Here. On May Day 1970, he was one of the Club's principal speakers at their 'Law and Liberty' rally in Trafalgar Square, held in answer to the 'Stop the Seventy Tour' campaign, designed to stop the South African cricket tour.

Julian Amery was the Monday Club's Guest-of-Honour at their Annual Dinner held at the Savoy Hotel, London, in January 1974, and again at the dinner at the end of the Club's two-day Conference in Birmingham in March 1975.

Political views.
He was, for a time, in favour of entry to the European Common Market, and also of the nuclear deterrent, both causes of some discord between himself and his old friend Enoch Powell.  He was, however, regarded by most as an Imperialist, and his father Leo noted at the time of the Suez crisis that "only Julian and Enoch Powell felt sufficiently strongly about the issue to go to the point of risking the government's existence".

In 1963, Amery took charge of Quintin Hogg's (Lord Hailsham) campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party. 189; 324.

In early 1975, he took part in a House of Commons debate on the Trades Unions Congress's invitation to Alexander Shelepin, the former Soviet KGB Chief, to visit Britain. He stated that "more and more people are beginning to look upon the TUC as a Communist-penetrated show and this invitation must strengthen that view."

According to Margaret Thatcher (in her 1995 memoirs The Path to Power), when Harold Wilson's Labour government proposed devolution for Scotland in 1976, "Julian Amery and Maurice Macmillan proved effective leaders of the anti-devolution Tory camp."

Although he was Macmillan's son-in-law, he failed to defend him when Count Nikolai Tolstoy published The Minister and the Massacres in 1986, focusing the ultimate burden of blame sharply on Macmillan for the repatriation of anti-communists and old Russian émigrés to Stalin and certain death. Amery stated that the repatriations were "one of the few blots on Harold that I can think of".

Trivia.
 Before Amery married, he had dated novelist Barbara Pym.
 Amery became a close friend of King Zog I of Albania and described him as "the cleverest man I have ever met".

<doc id="2317493" title="Ernst Nolte" nonfiltered="79" processed="78" dbindex="1480079">
Ernst Nolte (born 11 January 1923) is a German historian. Born in Witten, Germany to a Roman Catholic family, Nolte was a student of Martin Heidegger. Nolte s major interest is the comparative studies of Fascism and Communism. His work has been the object of extreme controversy. 

Fascism In Its Epoch.
Nolte first rose to fame with his 1963 book Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche (Fascism In Its Epoch; translated into English as The Three Faces Of Fascism), in which Nolte argued that Fascism arose as a form of resistance and a reaction against modernity. Using the methods of phenomenology, Nolte subjected German Nazism, Italian Fascism and the French Action Française movements to a comparative analysis. Nolte s conclusion was that fascism was the great anti-movement; namely it was anti-liberal, anti-communist, anti-Semitic, anti-capitalist, and anti-bourgeois. In Nolte s view, fascism was the rejection of everything the modern world had to offer and was an essentially negative phenomenon. The Three Faces of Fascism was much praised at the time and since as a seminal contribution to the creation of a theory of generic fascism. Roger Griffin has written that although written in an excessively arcane and obscure language, Nolte's theory of fascism as a  form of resistance to transcendence  (transcendence in German can be translated as the "spirit of modernity") marked an important step in the understanding of fascism, and helped to spur scholars into new avenues of research on fascism.

Later in the 1970s, Nolte was to reject the theory of generic Fascism that he had championed in The Three Faces of Fascism and instead embraced totalitarian theory as a way of explaining both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. In Nolte's opinion, Nazi Germany was a "mirror image" of the Soviet Union and with the exception of the  technical detail  of mass gassing everything the Nazis did, the Communists in Russia did first.

The Historikerstreit.
Nolte is best known for his role in launching the Historikerstreit (Historian s Dispute) of 1986-1987. On June 6, 1986 Nolte published an article entitled Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will ("The Past That Will Not Go Away") in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. His article was a distillation of ideas that Nolte had first introduced in lectures that he delivered in 1976 and in 1980. Nolte advanced the view that the crimes of the Nazis were only a defensive reaction against the crimes of the Soviets. In Nolte s view, National Socialism had only arisen in response to the  class genocide  and  Asian barbarism  of the Bolsheviks". Along the same lines, Nolte argued that the Holocaust, or "racial genocide" as Nolte prefers to call it, was an understandable if excessive response on the part of Adolf Hitler to the Soviet threat. Nolte labeled the Holocaust an "überschießende Reaktion" (overshooting reaction) to Bolshevik crimes. As proof of this argument, Nolte presented a letter written by Chaim Weizmann, the President of the World Zionist Organization on September 3, 1939 to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain pledging full and unconditional support to the British war effort. Nolte has called Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain a "Jewish declaration of war  against Germany" (see also "Judea Declares War on Germany"). The second piece of evidence Nolte presented was a book written in 1940 by the American author Theodore N. Kaufman called Germany Must Perish! that appealed to have all German men sterilized. Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to stage the Holocaust because Hitler concluded that entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany. From Nolte s point of view, the Holocaust was act of  Asian barbarism  forced on the Germans out of the fear over what Joseph Stalin, who Nolte charged had significant Jewish support, might do to them. Nolte has argued that after the Japanese attack on the United States in 1941, the U.S. authorities interned the entire Japanese-American population, so by the same logic, the Germans were within their rights to "intern" the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps". . 

Subsequently, Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book  Der europäische Bürgerkrieg, 1917-1945 (The European Civil War, 1917-1945) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide, totalitarianism, and tyranny, and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence, terror and population displacement. Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I, and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union, Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey in 1922-1923, and the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia. In Nolte's view, the great deciding event of the 20th century had been the Russian Revolution of 1917, which in Nolte's view, plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. In Nolte's opinion, fascism, which was Communism's twin arouse as a desperate response by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the  Bolshevik peril .  

These views ignited a firestorm of controversy. Most historians in West Germany and virtually all historians outside Germany condemned Nolte s interpretation as factually incorrect, and as coming dangerously close to justifying the Holocaust. Some of the historians who denounced  Nolte s work included Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Heinrich August Winkler, Wolfgang Mommsen, Karl-Dietrich Bracher and Eberhard Jäckel. Criticism from abroad came from Ian Kershaw, Gordon A. Craig, Richard J. Evans, Saul Friedländer, John Lukacs, Michael Marrus, and Timothy Mason. Wehler was so enraged by Nolte's views that he wrote a book Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit: ein polemischer Essay zum "Historikerstreit in 1988, which as its title indicates comprised twenty polemicial essays attacking every aspect of Nolte's views. Coming to Nolte's defence were the journalist Joachim Fest, and the historians Klaus Hildebrand, Rainer Zitelmann and Hagen Schulze.

In particular, Nolte s  evidence  for a Jewish war on Germany has been dismissed. It has been argued that Weizmann s letter to Chamberlain was written in his capacity as head of the World Zionist Organization, not on behalf of the entire Jewish people in Europe, and at any rate must be seen in the light of Weizmann s appeasing stance towards the British government in general; and that Nolte s views are based on the spurious idea that all Jews are Zionists and so follow the lead of Zionist leaders. Furthermore, it has been contended that there is no evidence that Hitler ever heard of Weizmann s letter. As for Kaufman s book, the Nazis were certainly aware of it; during the war, Germany Must Perish! was translated into German and widely promoted as an example of what Jews thought about Germans. But most historians contended that the views of one American Jew can in no way be taken as typical of what all European Jews were thinking, and to put the call for the forced sterilization of Germans that was never carried out as Allied policy in the same league as the Holocaust shows a profound moral insensitivity. Moreover, it has been shown that there is no indication that the Kaufman's book ever played any role in the decision-making progress that led to the Holocaust.

Finally, it has been contended that Nolte's comparison of the Holocaust with the internment of the Japanese-Americans is false, because Jews were sent to death camps, not concentration camps and that the U.S. government did not attempt to exterminate the Japanese-Americans in the interment camps. 

Nolte s critics have frequently charged him with having neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic sympathies. Nolte has always vehemently denied these charges, and has insisted that he is a neo-liberal in his politics. Nolte is by his own admission, an intense German nationalist and his stated goal is to restore the sense of pride in their history that he feels the Germans have been missing since 1945. Nolte s defenders have pointed to numerous statements on his part condemning Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Nolte s critics have acknowledged these statements, but go on to claim that Nolte makes arguments that can be construed as being sympathetic to the Nazis such as his defence of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order or his use of Nazi-era language such as Nolte's practice of referring to the Red Army soldiers in World War II as  Asiatic hordes . In particular, controversy has centered around an argument that Nolte made in his 1985 essay  Between Myth and Revisionism  from the book Aspects of the Third Reich. In his essay Nolte argued that if the PLO were to destroy Israel, then the subsequent history written in the new Palestinian state would portray the former Israeli state in the blackest of colors". ; in Nolte s opinion, a similar situation exists in regards to the history of Nazi Germany. Many historians such as the British historian Richard J. Evans have claimed that by making this argument Nolte is attempting to claim that the only reason why Nazism is seen is evil is because Germany lost World War II, not because of the Holocaust. Nolte has always denied these allegations of Nazi sympathies. Likewise, Nolte has pointed out that he always refused frequent offers to speak at the gatherings of the Institute for Historical Review; Nolte's critics such as Deborah Lipstadt have charged that the nature of Nolte's arguments about the Holocaust has led to these frequent invitations to speak at the I.H.R. Lipstadt has argued that in her view the nature of Nolte's work is a more insidious and dangerous form of Holocaust denial then the work of David Irving. 

In June 2000, Nolte was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize for Literature. The award attracted widespread protests and controversy. Currently, Nolte is a professor at the Free University of Berlin.

Folkspraak (other variants are common - see Name) is an international auxiliary language (IAL) project based on the Germanic languages, currently in development. It is intended to be quickly learnable by all Germanic speakers (a group including over 465 million native speakers, and an additional 300 to 900 million who speak English as a second language). It is not meant to be designed by any one individual, but is a collective work created by all interested parties, according to the Folkspraak charter guidelines. 

 Discussion and dialects .

Currently no final version of Folkspraak exists, with several developers having their own versions displaying their own preferences, though some form of homogenisation is generally the eventual aim. Thus there are currently disagreements about many rather basic areas of the language including orthography, grammar, and vocabulary. Interestingly, many of the dialects proposed tend to look most like an English-influenced version of Dutch or Low German, although many have notably North Germanic features.

The guiding idea for building the vocabulary is that a word from the same root, with the same or similar meaning, should be common or exist in three out of four core languages: (General) English, (High) German, Dutch and Swedish/Norwegian/Danish. The Scandinavian languages are often counted as one language here, and a word wouldn't need to be common in more than one of these languages. Since many common words are often found in only two core languages at most, this method has not been proven sufficient for creating a complete Germanic auxiliary language. Several different methods have been elaborated to get cross the problem, including:
 Accept that a word only found in two different core languages should hold valid. This method would often create many synonyms.
 Using more common synonyms or compounds, such as "werk-schy"/"arbeid-schy" for lazy (work-shy).
 Using smaller, less common Germanic languages, including Low German, Afrikaans, Yiddish, Frisian, Icelandic.
 Using the word most common in Proto-Germanic.
 Referring to words common in other auxiliary languages or large language families (such as Interlingua or Slovio).


 Name .

"Folkspraak" has traditionally been what the language has been referred to as, but as different 'versions' of the language have different phonemic and graphemic realisations of historical phonemes, and also different capitalization and punctuation rules, the realisation of the name changes accordingly in each 'version'. Thus some would write "Folkspraak", others "Folksprak", "folk-spraak", "Folksprâk", "Folkspræk" etc. The basic form of the word is the Proto-Germanic roots "fulka-" (source of English "folk" and German "Volk") and "sprækijo" (source of "speech" and "Sprache") meaning "people" and "language" respectively. The compound thus means "people language", with the implication "language of the people" - it is debatable whether it would be better rendered with a genitive "-s" suffix on the "fulka-" element, thus yielding something of the form "Folksspraak" with the clear meaning "people's language". 

 Middelsprake .

There is also the related Inter-Germanic conlang Middelsprake, designed independently by Ingmar Roerdinkholder (now a member of the Folkspraak Yahoo! group). Middelsprake turned out to be rather close to Folkspraak. Some of the differences are that some of the 'versions' of Folkspraak include archaic orthography and phonology which are not present in the modern Germanic languages, and, compared to these versions, Middlesprake has a more regular and simple spelling and pronunciation, and to some extent grammar. 

Middelsprake is based on the comparison between eight living Germanic languages: English, German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Low Saxon, Frisian and Nynorsk Norwegian, and is an intermediate language between West Germanic and Scandinavian varieties. Test subjects have been able to understand almost completely at first sight, including people from Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden. Even English speakers can recognize a lot of their own wordstock in it.




 F lkspræk / Folksprak .

A 'version' of Folkspraak called F lkspræk (also called Meta-Folksprak and Boksprak) has been developed by Stephan Schneider. Its phoneme inventory is based on reconstructed Proto-Germanic. Diacritic signs are used in order to represent etymological and grammatical phenomena. For instance, the ring above u in the name  F lkspræk  shows a Proto Germanic u, which turned to o in at least one of the modern Germanic languages, such as English in this case (cf. folk).

Folksprak (N.B. single 'a') is based on F lkspræk, and therefore it is based in turn on Proto-Germanic. This means, it is not, unlike Middelsprake, a blend of modern Germanic languages, but an artificial (and hopefully thus logical, and indeed simple) member of the Germanic language family. Folksprak is nonetheless very similar in realisation to the "real" modern Germanic languages, because it features phoneme shifts following those seen in the development of modern Germanic (for instance, the Proto Germanic u in the word "F lkspræk" turns to o in Folksprak, as in modern Germanic). Folksprak uses the English alphabet plus two extra vowels: æ and ø.

This division into F lkspræk and Folksprak was supposed to help the Folkspraak-developers to focus both on Proto Germanic influences on Folkspraak and orthographic simplicity.

In theory, F lkspræk is able to represent any modern Germanic word (e. g. English mouse as mûs).

The Lord's Prayer.

As an example of Folkspraak in comparison to other Germanic languages, consider five proposed versions of the Lord's Prayer next to the Dutch, standard German and English prayer:

Rowan Cahill (born 1945) is an Australian radical historian and journalist with background as a teacher, and farmhand, and has variously worked for the trade union movement as a rank and file activist, delegate and publicist.  During the Vietnam War he was a conscientious objector, and was prominent in the anti-war, student protest, and New Left movements of the period, primarily as a publicist and communicator.  These activities led to him being placed under surveillance by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).  Cahill has been widely published in socialist, trade  union, academic and mainstream publications; he has written numerous pamphlets and booklets, and is the author or co-author of three books, including a history of the militant Seamen's Union of Australia (1981).

The Church of Saint Andrew and St Paul is a Presbyterian church in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It is the regimental church of The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada.

This congregation is the 1918 merger of two congregations, both formed in the early years of the nineteenth century. 

St. Andrew's Church, Montreal was formed in 1802. It was the second such Presbyterian congregation, following the Scots Presbyterian Congregation, St. Gabriel Street Church, that began in 1787, became First PC in 1910, and is now part of Knox, Crescent, Kensington and First. 

Started in a room on Notre Dame Street, St. Andrew's was originally known as St. Peter's Street Church, and in 1820, became closer connected with the Church of Scotland. 
Buildings:
1806--St. Peter's Street;
1851-Building on Beaver Hall Hill;
1869-Building burned down and rebuilt.

In 1875, St. Andrew's remained out of the merger that joined Canadian Presbyterians; instead, remaining with the Church of Scotland until their merger with St. Paul's in 1918. 

St. Paul's Church, was formed in 1832, as a result of another conflict at the pioneer St. Gabriel Street Church, over the successor to Rev. James Somerville; between either Rev. Robert Easton, or Rev. Edward Black (both assistants to Sommerville). The conflict went over to Scotland, where it was encouraged that the Canadian Church of Scotland congregations form their own Synod to handle such matters. The result of this, in 1831, was to form a new congregation in Montreal and St. Paul's, under the leadership of Black was the miniority from St. Gabriel, placed under Easton.

In 1870, this building served as the meeting place for the delegates from the 4 Canadian Presbyterian groups, that eventually merged in 1875. St Paul's gained a few St. Andrew's families who were supportive towards the Presbyterian Church in Canada.

Buildings:
1834 Rue Ste Helene--owned by John Redpath and Peter McGill.
1867 on Dorchester Boulevard.  ;


St. Andrew and St Paul.
The present building was constructed on Sherbrooke Street at the corner of Redpath, and opened in 1932. It is in close proximity to McGill University, Concordia University (George Wlliams Campus) as well as the Guy-Concordia Metro station.

City West Link Road is a road in Sydney, Australia. It makes up a section of Metroad 4 between Leichhardt, Haberfield and Five Dock. As such, it provides an alternative route to Parramatta Road into Sydney's CBD from the Inner-West.

The City West Link, much to the dislike of some local residents, simply involved the upgrade of existing roads and streets to at least four lanes. The process was carried out in four stages:
Stage One: (December 1991) An underpass beneath Victoria Road was constructed.
Stage Two: (February 1993) Upgrades from The Crescent at Rozelle to Catherine Street at Lilyfield, using Brennan Street. This section used a temporary one-way system to deliver traffic to Lilyfield Road.
Stage Three: (May 1995) Dobroyd Parade and Wattle Street reconstruction was completed, providing four lanes between Parramatta Road and Hawthorne Canal.
Stage Four: (December 2000) Extended the road from Catherine Street to Dobroyd Parade. A new bridge was constructed over Hawthorne Canal. The City West Link then became part of Metroad 4, relieving a congested section of Parramatta Road.

Motorists began complaining early in 2004 that the road had already become congested, less than 4 years after opening. Most of the road is 4 lanes in width, whereas the section of Parramatta Road it replaced was mainly six lanes wide. Another issue with the road is that it ultimately feeds into Parramatta Road anyway. Thus congestion points on Parramatta Road have simply been moved to different areas rather than relieved altogether.

In 2005, a major bottleneck at the eastern end was removed. Previously eastbound traffic on the link had to merge from two lanes into one, just before joining Victoria Road west of the Anzac Bridge. There are now two lanes from the west link merging with the three from Victoria Road, to make four lanes over the Anzac Bridge.

The project is in some ways very similar to the South Eastern Arterial link in Melbourne, Australia. That road was built between two freeways, and ultimately had to be rebuilt without traffic signalled at-grade intersections. The only difference between the two is the available space for the Melbourne road allowed the conversion without any land resumption, whereas the City West Link Road is surrounded by properties which are in places only a few feet from the road edge. Like so many other new road projects in Sydney, the available land space and cash resources available lead to either too few traffic lanes, or at-grade intersections.

The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority had plans to connect the City West Link to the M4 motorway, completely bypassing Parramatta Road. Included in the project was the removal of the at-grade intersections on the City West Link for through traffic. The plan was complicated, and involved building bridges for the City West Link Road to pass over at-grade intersections, some of which made provision for only one traffic lane in each direction. Residents and advocacy groups have voiced fears that this will worsen current congestion problems. The whole project was cancelled in late 2004.

Claude Bolling (born April 10, 1930), is a renowned French jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and occasional actor.

He was born in Cannes, studied at the Nice Conservatory, then in Paris.  A child prodigy, by age 14 he was playing jazz piano professionally, with Lionel Hampton, Roy Eldridge, and Kenny Clarke.

He has written music for over one hundred films, mostly French, starting with the score for a 1957 documentary about the Cannes Film Festival, and including the films Borsalino (1970), and California Suite (1979).

Bolling is also noted for a series of "crossover" collaborations with classical musicians.  His Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio with Jean-Pierre Rampal, a clever and charming mix of Baroque elegance with modern swing, has been a top seller for many years, and was followed up by other works in the same vein. It was particularly popular in the United States, and it was at the top of the hit parade for two years after its release.

Following his work with Rampal, Bolling went on to work with many other musicians, from different genres, including Alexandre Lagoya, Pinchas Zukerman, Maurice André, and Yo-Yo Ma. He has also worked with, and performed tributes to many others, including Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Stéphane Grappelli, Django Reinhardt, Oscar Peterson.

In mathematics, Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups is a basic theorem of functional analysis which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H and one-parameter families of unitary operators

;

which are strongly continuous, that is 

;

and are homomorphisms:

;

Such  one-parameter families are ordinarily referred to as strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups.  The theorem is named after Marshall Stone who formulated and proved this theorem in 1932.

 Formal statement .

Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H.  Then

;

is a strongly continuous one-parameter family of unitary operators.  The infinitesimal generator of t is the operator i A. This mapping is a bijective correspondence.

A will be a bounded operator iff the operator-valued function t   Ut is norm continuous.

 Example .

The family of translation operators

;

is a  one-parameter unitary group of unitary operators; the infinitesimal generator of this family is an extension of the differential operator

;

defined on the space of complex-valued continuously differentiable functions of compact support on R.  Thus

;

 Applications and generalizations .
Stone's theorem has numerous applications in quantum mechanics. For instance, given an isolated quantum mechanical system, with Hilbert space of states H, time evolution is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on H.  The infinitesimal generator of this group is the system Hamiltonian.

The Hille Yosida theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of contractions on Banach spaces.

Ratafia is a liqueur or cordial flavoured with peach or cherry kernels, bitter almonds, or other fruits; many different varieties are made.  The same name is given to a flavouring essence resembling bitter almonds, and also to a light biscuit. It is also a cordial made from a mix of marc brandy and the unfermented juice of the grape. 

The flavorings can potentially make this liqueur toxic, as peach and cherry kernels contain high levels of hydrogen cyanide (about 1.7 mg per gram of kernel), as do bitter almonds (2.5 mg/g)..  

The name 'ratafia' might be adapted from the French of the 17th century. Walter William Skeat (Etym. Dict., 1910) quotes as a possible origin a combination of Malay araq, arak, and tafia, rum. An alternative etymology proposes that the name derives from a custom of drinking to the ratification of a deal or treaty.

Peninsula Ridge Estates Winery in Beamsville, Ontario (Niagara Region) is currently the only Canadian producer of Ratafia.

Here's one criticism I have of the creationists' universe. Aside from the fact that it just ain't so, I mean. I tell people I don't accept the idea that there's anything supernatural, but there's also another dimension there. The created cosmos is ugly, poorly constructed and patched together, lacking in depth or size. It extends but a few thousand years past and future. Rather than brought into existence out of the very substance of the world, life is imposed by some external entity, forever foreign and out of place. The sufferings of creatures are meaningless to them and evil
because they are imposed by a being who doesn't have to do that. Far from uplifting, since you aren't supposed to
ask too much, the created universe is crass and materialistic, without subtlety or continuity, much like an automated
amusement park in which turning your head at the wrong time shows the wires leading to the animals' feet and the
wooden beams propping up the hollow rocks. Dead, false, dull. Unaesthetic.

<doc id="5260722" title="VirtualGL" nonfiltered="95" processed="93" dbindex="1480095">
VirtualGL is an open source program which redirects the 3D rendering commands from Unix and Linux OpenGL applications to 3D accelerator hardware in a dedicated server and displays the rendered output interactively to a thin client located elsewhere on the network.

The Problem.
Normally, VNC and other thin client environments for Unix and Linux either do not support running OpenGL applications at all or force the OpenGL applications to be rendered without the benefit of OpenGL hardware acceleration.  Remotely displaying 3D applications with hardware acceleration has traditionally required the use of "indirect rendering."  Indirect rendering uses the GLX extension to X Windows to encapsulate the OpenGL commands inside of the X Windows protocol stream and ship them over the network from the application server to an X Windows server running on the user's desktop.  All of the OpenGL commands are executed on the user's desktop, so the client machine must have a fair amount of CPU, memory, and graphics rendering horsepower.

Indirect rendering can be shown to perform well if the network is sufficiently fast (gigabit ethernet, for instance), if the application does not dynamically modify the geometry of the object being rendered, if the application uses display lists, and if the application does not use a great deal of texture mapping.  But many OpenGL applications do not meet these criteria.  To further complicate matters, it is often the case that OpenGL extensions, such as vertex/fragment programs, vertex arrays, etc. do not work in an indirect rendering environment.  Some of these extensions require the ability to directly access the 3D graphics hardware and thus can never be made to work indirectly.  In other cases, either the server's OpenGL library or the client's X server do not provide explicit support for the needed OpenGL extension, or the extension relies on a specific hardware configuration that is not present on the client machine.

Performing OpenGL rendering on the server circumvents the issues introduced by indirect rendering, since the application now has a fast and direct path to the 3D rendering hardware.  If the rendering occurs on the server, then only the resulting 2D images must be sent to the client.  Images can be delivered at the same frame rate regardless of how big the 3D data was that was used to generate them, so performing 3D rendering on the server effectively converts the 3D performance problem into a 2D performance problem.  The problem then becomes how to stream 1-2 megapixels of image data over a network at interactive frame rates.  But commodity technologies (HDTV, to name one) already exist to address this problem.

VirtualGL's Solution.
VirtualGL uses "GLX forking" to implement server-side OpenGL rendering.  Unix and Linux OpenGL applications normally send GLX commands to the X server to bind OpenGL rendering contexts to a particular X window, obtain a list of pixel formats that the X server supports, etc.  But if the X server is in fact a thin client proxy application (such as VNC) that doesn't support the GLX X Windows extension, then these applications will fail to execute.

VirtualGL takes advantage of a feature in Unix and Linux that allows one to "preload" a library into an application, effectively intercepting (AKA "interposing") certain function calls that the application would normally make to shared libraries with which it is linked.  Once VirtualGL is preloaded into a Unix or Linux OpenGL application, it intercepts the GLX function calls from the application and redirects them onto the server's X display, which presumably has a 3D hardware accelerator attached.  In the process of redirecting the GLX calls, VirtualGL also modifies the calls in order to force OpenGL rendering to occur in off-screen pixel buffers ("Pbuffers") rather than in X windows.  Meanwhile, the rest of the function calls from the application, including non-OpenGL X Windows calls, are allowed to pass through without modification.

Internally, VirtualGL's interposer engine also maintains a map of windows to Pbuffers, matches visual attributes between the destination X server and the X server on which the 3D rendering will occur, and performs a variety of other hashing functions to assure that the GLX redirection is seamless.  But essentially, once the OpenGL context is established on the server's display, VirtualGL gets out of the way and allows all subsequent OpenGL commands to pass through unimpeded to the server's 3D hardware.  Thus, the application can automatically use whatever OpenGL features and extensions are provided by the server's hardware and drivers.

Apart from marshalling GLX commands and managing Pbuffers, VirtualGL also reads back the rendered pixels at the appropriate time (usually by monitoring glXSwapBuffers() or glFinish()) and then draws those pixels into the appropriate X window using standard X image drawing commands.  Since VirtualGL is redirecting the GLX commands away from the destination X server, it can be used both to add 3D support to X proxies (such as VNC) which lack 3D support as well as to prevent indirect OpenGL rendering from occurring in a remote X display scenario.


Using VirtualGL in concert with VNC or another X proxy allows multiple users to simultaneously run 3D applications on a single server and multiple clients to share each session.  However, VNC and its ilk are tuned to handle 2D applications with large areas of solid color, few colors, and few inter-frame differences.  3D applications, on the other hand, generate images with fine-grained, complex color patterns and much less correlation between subsequent frames.  The workload generated by drawing rendered images from an OpenGL application into an X window is essentially the same workload as a video player, and off-the-shelf thin client software typically lacks sufficiently fast image codecs to be able to handle this workload with interactive frame rates.

VirtualGL works around this problem in two ways:

 TurboVNC;
 Direct Mode;

TurboVNC.
TurboVNC is an offshoot of TightVNC which accelerates the JPEG encoding paths of the latter by taking advantage of hand-tuned multimedia primitives from Intel and Sun Microsystems.  When used with VirtualGL, TurboVNC is capable of streaming the output of a full-screen (1280x1024) 3D application at greater than 15 frames/second with perceptually lossless image quality on 100 Megabit ethernet.  TurboVNC includes further optimizations to allow it to achieve 7-10 frames/second over broadband, with noticeable but usable image quality loss.  TurboVNC also extends TightVNC to include client-side double buffering and optimized binaries for Solaris.  TurboVNC and VirtualGL are used by the Texas Academic Computing Center at UT to allow users of the TeraGrid to remotely access the 3D rendering capabilities of the Maverick terascale visualization supercomputer.

Direct Mode.

In Direct Mode, VirtualGL compresses the rendered 3D images in process using the same optimized JPEG codec that TurboVNC uses.  VirtualGL then sends the compressed images directly to a VirtualGL Client application running on the client machine.  The VirtualGL Client is responsible for decompressing the images and drawing the pixels into the appropriate X window.  Meanwhile, the non-OpenGL elements of the application's display are sent over the network using the standard remote X Windows protocol and rendered on the client machine.

This approach requires that an X server be present on the client machine, and the reliance upon the remote X Windows protocol means that Direct Mode performs poorly on high-latency networks.  Additionally, Direct Mode does not inherently support collaboration (multiple clients per session), since the images are being pushed to the client rather than pulled from the server.  But Direct Mode does provide a completely seamless application experience, whereby every application window corresponds to a single desktop window.  Direct Mode also provides better performance than TurboVNC on local area networks and reduces the server CPU load, since the 2D rendering is now occurring on the client.

The developers of VirtualGL envision the primary users of Direct Mode to be laptop users connected to the 3D server with 802.11g wireless or fast ethernet.

The 156 began on the 23rd April 1983, the route served between Morden Station and Clapham Junction (Grant Road), the route can into action as parts of the 77A and M1 were withdrawn. The 156 was operated at Merton Garage (AL) and it was operated by DMS. The PVR was Monday to Saturday 12DMS and Sunday 6DMS. In October 1984 after 7:45pm the 156 terminated at Northcote instead of Grant Road, the PVR also changed in this year Monday to Friday 9DMS, Saturday 11DMS and Sunday stayed the same at 6DMS. 

By August 1985, the 156 was extended from Clapham Junction to Vauxhall (Monday- Friday Peaks only). The Monday to Friday PVR was increased to 18DMS, Saturday and Sunday was unchanged. 2 years later in July 1987, the Monday to Saturday service between Raynes Park to Morden was withdrawn and replaced by a new route (163). The route was Monday to Saturday Rayners Park to Clapham Junction. Monday to Friday Peaks Raynes Park to Vauxhall Station. Sunday journeys ran between Morden to Clapham Junction. Monday to Saturday allocation was transferred to Stockwell Garage (SW). The PVR changed again, Monday to Friday 16DMS, other days were not changed. 

2 years on, AL Sunday service was transferred to SW so the 156 was operated daily from Stockwell Garage, the PVR for Monday to Friday was decreased by 1 bus to make it 15DMS. By March 1991 the Sunday operation at AL was transferred back, but the Monday to Friday service was still at SW, they also started to introduce Metrobuses on the 156. The PVR was currently Monday to Friday 11DMS/M, Saturday 10DMS/M and Sunday 6DMS/M. 2 months later in May the allocation was back at AL full time, and was operated by DR's. It was withdrawn between Clapham Junction and Vauxhall, also between Wimbledon and Morden. So the 156 only operated from Clapham Junction to Wimbledon. The PVR was now Monday to Saturday 9DR and Sunday 7DR. 

In 1994 AL allocated a Metrobus to the 156 for school journeys, also MRL's started appearing on the 156 with the DR's still operating. By 1996 the Metrobus was still going on the 156 but the DR buses were withdrawn so it was only operated by MRL's. 

When late 1997 came the contract was reassigned to Limebourne, it was being operated by Battersea Garage QB and the double decker school journey was being operated by Nostalgia Bus. The PVR was now Monday to Saturday 8SD, and Sunday 5SD, also 1 double decker Monday to Friday. In April 1999 the school journey double decker was transferred to Limebourne. Later on in 2001 Limebourne were taken over by Connex this was still operated at QB and a lot of the buses from Limebourne were now with Connex. The PVR was now 8DCL Monday to Saturday, Sunday 6DCL. A year later Connex converted the 156 to double deck which was being operated by Trident/Alexander's (TA's). The PVR was now increased 13TA Monday to Friday, Saturday 12TA and Sunday 10TA, from the end of 2002 the route was extended from Clapham Junction to Vauxhall. 

During 2004 Travel London took over Connex and they used the same garage and buses (TA's). The PVR is currently 13TA Monday to Friday, 12TA Saturday and 8TA Sunday's. The average journey time is between 35 and 65 minutes. The frequency for Monday to Saturday is every 10 minutes, Sunday and evenings are between every 15-20 minutes.

<doc id="914406" title="Giant Robo" nonfiltered="98" processed="96" dbindex="1480098">





, is a tokusatsu, anime and manga series created by Mitsuteru Yokoyama. It is similar to his famous manga/anime series, Tetsujin 28 (the OVA version of Giant Robo features characters from Tetsujin 28), only Giant Robo has more fantastic elements.

Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot is the name given in the U.S. to the 26-episode tokusatsu (live-action) series based on Giant Robo, produced by Toei Company Ltd. in 1967. 

The later 7-episode OVA series was produced by Mu Films in an interval between 1992 and 1998, it is considered as one of the best of the "retro-anime" produced in the 1990s, and also one of the greatest anime series ever to be produced. It is available on six VHS tapes by Manga Video and three DVDs by Media Blasters.

The 1967 Series.
The original tokusatsu TV series aired on NET (now TV Asahi) from October 11, 1967 to April 1, 1968, with a total of 26 episodes.

Plot.

The Earth is under invasion by a terrorist group called Big Fire (Gargoyle in the US version), an illuminati style organization led by the alien Emperor Guillotine, who spends almost the entire series in a multicolored space ship hidden at the bottom of one of the Earth's oceans (presumably the Pacific) from where he issues his orders to the members of Gargoyle (frequently referred to in the series as "The Gargoyle Gang"). 

The members of Gargoyle, as it turns out, are an ambitious but somewhat incompetent bunch who appear to have a fairly high mortality rate due either to Unicorn actions or Guillotine's own fits of anger.  Their wardrobe is an interesting collection of what appears to be an assortment of castoffs from Soviet officers, wartime Wehrmacht personnel, Central American guerillas, and the designers of Italian sunglasses.  In addition, at least one Gargoyle member is always seen with a beatnik beard. Most of Gargoyle's members wear berets adorned with a skull on the front.  All members of Gargoyle have an explosive device implanted within their bodies that can be detonated in the event they're captured, though this seems to be used only rarely.

Guillotine himself has a large blue head with tentacles extending from the bottom of the head; not unlike Cthulhu.  He wears a long robe, and carries a staff with a white orb at its furthest end.  Like his head, the rest of his body is blue.  He is capable of growing to an enormous height, though this is only seen once in the series.

Guillotine leaves day-to-day matters in the hands of various commanders; principally Spider (a human who is eventually killed by a spray of acid), Doctor Botanus (Doctor Over in the Japanese series; a silver-skinned alien capable of teleportation), Fangar (Red Cobra in the Japanese series, and also alternatively referred to as Dangor the Executioner in the US series - a bizarre alien with a pegleg and crutch, a greatly enlarged forehead, protruding upper teeth, and a costume that looks like a traditional striped prison outfit in front and a red velvet jumpsuit in back), and Harlequin (Black Dia in the Japanese version, who has a fascination with the suits of playing cards).

The group captures scientists to create an army of giant monsters to rampage the Earth. But fate stumbles on a little boy named Daisaku Kusama (Johnny Sokko in the US) and a young man named J r  Minami (Jerry Mano in the US), the latter is secretly Member U3 of the top-secret peacekeeping organization, Unicorn. Daisaku and J r  are shipwrecked on an island after the ocean liner they were on was attacked by a giant sea monster called Dracolon, and are captured by members of Big Fire. When trying to escape, they end up in an elevator that leads down to a huge construction complex where a giant robot is being built. Pharaoh-like in appearance, this indestructible humanoid robot is being built by captive scientist Dr. Lucius Guardian, who decides to give the two escapees its control device, a miniature transmitter built into a wristwatch. The robot can only be controlled by the first voice that is recorded in its electronic brain (but he first needs to be charged up by atomic energy). Dr. Guardian helps Daisaku and J r  escape, only to be shot to death, but not before he set an atomic bomb that destroyed the base, the resulting explosion activates the giant robot, which moves to Daisaku's every command. As the controller of the robot (heretofore known as "Giant Robo," or just "Giant Robot" in the US), Daisaku is invited by J r  and his chief Azuma to join Unicorn as its 7th member, U7! As U7, Daisaku fights the evil forces of Big Fire with the help of U3/J r  and Giant Robo.

In the final episode Giant Robot directly confronts Guillotine, who has grown to the same size as Giant Robot.  Guillotine claims that his body at that size is capable of creating a nuclear explosion capable of wiping out the Earth, and demonstrates his power by ripping off one of his fingernails and producing a small nuclear explosion.  As the Earth hovers on the brink of surrender to Guillotine, Giant Robot - despite Daisaku's commands to the contrary - attacks Guillotine, picks him up, and flies into outer space, at which point Guillotine detonates, destroying both himself and Giant Robot.  The threat to Earth has been eliminated, but at the cost of Earth's greatest protector.



Weapons and functions.
The Giant Robot has numerous weapons systems which Johnny can command the robot use:
Finger missiles: Fired from the fingers with an undetermined number of rounds;
Back missile:  Fired from the back of the robot as the robot is lying on its chest facing toward its enemy.  The back missile is considerably larger and more destructive than the finger missiles.
Bazooka cannon:  A weapon which fires out of the top of the robot's head - not so much a bazooka as  a shower of sparks capable of blinding and disorienting an enemy.
Eye beams: A twinned energy blast from the eyes.
The center V on the chest can launch and ram against the enemy to force it back.  In addition, the robot's "belt buckle" contains a long pole which can be used to hook onto an enemy.

As a security precaution in case Johnny is forced to give unwanted orders, the boy can give a seeming line of gibberish into the communicator before doing so "Od ton yebo redro!", claiming it is a communication test.  However, the Robot is programmed to play the message backwards as "Do not obey order!"  With that message, the robot is programmed to take it as a signal that his controller is captured and regardless of any subsequent order, the Robot will launch and trace the signal to rescue his controller.

What's Robo Saying?.
It's generally known that Giant Robo doesn't speak, but every time Daisaku gives him a command, he responds with an echoing, roaring "MASSHHHH!!!"
(In the OVA , it lets out an echoing "AOOOOOOHHHHHHHMMMM!")

The US Version.
The entire series was first broadcast in the United States in 1969 and became quite popular in the next few years, particularly during the 1971 to 1973 period when it reached its peak in distribution and popularity. In 1970, several episodes were edited together to create the movie Voyage Into Space which has now reached cult film status.

While recently released on DVD by Toei Video in Japan (the entire series had also been available on laserdisc during the 1990s), the 26 episode series and the movie have never been officially released in the United States, with the exception of the first eight episodes, which were released on videocassette by Orion Home Video.  

Following Orion's folding into MGM, and MGM's purchase by Sony of America, the American rights to the series are now in the hands of Sony.  However, bootleg copies of the entire U.S. version of the series have long been available on both VHS and DVD.

The American version of the series was astonishingly violent by the standards of childrens' programming in the 1960s, and would certainly never pass muster today.  Guns and shooting are staples of every episode of the series, and the series' two child leads - Johnny Sokko and Mari Hanson (Mari Hanamura in the Japanese version; a 9-year-old girl introduced in the seventh episode who speaks 39 languages and is a crack shot with a firearm) - were frequently seen shooting along with the rest of the Unicorn agents.  In one episode Johnny and Mari are captured by Gargoyle, tied to two trees, and are within seconds of being executed by firing squad when Unicorn agents rescue them.  Oddly enough, though practically every Japanese anime exported to the United States during that period was edited due to violent content, Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot seems to have escaped close scrutiny in that regard, and what editing was done on the show seems to have been more for the purposes of squeezing in another commercial or two rather than in the interest of curbing the show's violence. 

It should be noted that in addition to dubbing American voice actors for the U.S. release, many of the show's sound effects were also remixed or re-recorded entirely.  And though the show's Japanese musical soundtrack was often used, it was frequently used in different places from the Japanese version of the series, or replaced altogether by a jazz-influenced score.  

Catherine Byers (aka Bobbie Byers), who provided Johnny Sokko's English language voice, has had a lengthy career since the 1960s.  She is also known for having voiced Captain Bonnie (Bokko) on the English language version of The Amazing 3, as well as Prince Planet on the series of the same name.  She appeared on-camera in two 1960s biker films; 1967's Wild Rebels and 1968's Savages from Hell.  Since then she has focused on voice acting (primarily talking books) and stage work.  Her Amazing 3 coworkers Neil Patrick, Paul Brown, Kurt Nagel, and Jerry Burke also provided various voices on Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot.

After Giant Robo.

Mitsunobu Kaneko (who had played Daisaku Kusama/Johnny Sokko in the original series) died in 1997.  His acting career appears to have completely ended after Giant Robo.  

Mitsuo Ando (Doctor Over/Doctor Botanus) also died in 1997, having spent his acting career playing various characters in children's shows.  

Japanese narrator Koichi Chiba died in 2001, having played a number of roles until the year before his death.  Interestingly, he was the only person associated with the 1966 series who was also involved with the OVA, voicing Dr. Franken Von Forglor.

Hideo Murota, who played the villain known as Black Dia/Harlequin, died of lung cancer in 2002, having spent his entire life following Giant Robo in a variety of film and TV roles.  It's fair to say that of all the series' regular actors, his career was the most successful.  

Akio Ito (Juro Minami/Jerry Mano) is reportedly now a production designer.

Yumiko Katayama (Mitsuko Nishino/Mitsuko Hino) also appeared in the 1969 Japanese TV series Playgirl.  Other than Giant Robo she is probably best remembered for having appeared in two of the early '70s "Pinky Violence" films; 1971's Zubeko bancho: zange no neuchi mo nai (Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless to Confess) and 1973's Zenka onna: koroshi-bushi (Criminal Woman: Killing Melody).  Her acting career appears to have ended after 1973.

Matasaburo Tamba (Spider) had played small roles in several movies prior to Giant Robo.  His only role of note following Giant Robo was as the villainous Black Shogun in the 1971 TV series Kamen Raida.  

The careers of the series' other actors appear to have ended entirely after the early '70s, if not before.

The OVA Series.

Plot.

Giant Robo takes place in 2049. It is a retro-esque future where the invention of the Shizuma Drive has brought about the third energy revolution, ascending mankind into an age of prosperity that began ten years ago. At that time, Dr. Shizuma and his four colleagues began to develop the drives. They were to be the perfect energy source; non-polluting and recyclable.

With this new revolution there came a heavy price...

Dr. Franken Von Forglor (transliterated as "Vogler" in the US ) , one of the five men who created the drives, went insane and activated an experimental reactor core that was being developed by the five scientists in their laboratory in Bashitarlle. A core meltdown ensued, causing a world-wide energy neutralization field and an explosion that resulted in the destruction of the entire city, and the loss of one third of the Earth's population. The event was entitled The Tragedy of Bashitarlle and became the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind.

Now Dr. Von Forglor, along with his associates, the would-be dictators called Big Fire, dispatch a giant orb to float across the world, draining the energy from all major cities and causing global chaos. The orb is powered by a new kind of Shizuma drive, of which only three examples exist.  Big Fire have two (both of which power the orb), and the Experts of Justice possess the third.  Big Fire would prefer to possess all three, but can operate the orb with only two.  The super-powered team which opposes the Experts of Justice are called "The Magnificent Ten". 

Against them are "The Experts of Justice," nine in number, a group of martial artists, scientific geniuses, and secret agents. Many of them have origins in Chinese folk hero tales, such as Tetsugyu, nicknamed "The Iron Ox". The One of them is youngster Daisaku Kusama (same name as in the live-action series above). Only the voice of Daisaku, the son of a scientist murdered by Big Fire, can control Giant Robo, a 90-foot tall war machine originally designed by Daisaku's father for Big Fire but now devoted to fight crime. 

Giant Robo is not presented as a machine to command in an aloof manner but as a team member to be included in the team spirit. It cries when it can't smash through a force field; Daisaku then abandons it for a time but returns to ask its help in the fight again. 

The only females in the story are GinRei ("Silver Bell"), an expert agent who wears a white Chinese dress; Yoshi Blue Face, an expert agent from Chinese mythology; and Sunny, the young daughter of the Magnificent Ten's Lord Alberto.


Production notes on the OVA.

The title of the OVA series is Giant Robo: The Animation, with the added subtitle GR: the Day the Earth Stood Still. Begun in 1992, the episodes of this OVA were produced intermittently due to the involvement of its director, Yasuhiro Imagawa, in other projects. Composer Masamichi Amano scored the grandiose musical themes for the project with the Warsaw Orchestra in Poland, considered by fans as some of his best work and a highlight of the series by itself. 

Besides Tetsujin 28, Imagawa pastiched other characters from Mitsuteru Yokoyama series, including characters from Godmars, Babel II, Sally, the Witch, Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Tales of the Water Margin/Suikoden (the last two retold the stories in two of the Four Classics of Chinese literature).

OVA Character and Other References.
Here's a partial list of the character and other references in the GR OVA:

Big Fire - The young leader of the Big Fire organization resembles the protagonist in Babel II (Babiru Nisei      );
Neptune - Poseidon (A giant robot, one of 3 protectors of Babel II);
Garuda - Lopross/Ropross (A giant "bird", protector of Babel II);
Achilles - Rodem (A shape-shifting talking black panther, protector of Babel II);
Koumei - K ngMíng (brilliant strategist from Romance of the Three Kingdoms);
Ryozanpaku - Liang Shan Po (location where the story of Water Margin took place);
Ko-Enshaku - A character from Water Margin;
 Sally - The main character of Sally the Witch. In this version, she's called Sunny, the name Yokoyama was originally going to use for her.

Many of the characters in the OVA were taken from various works by Yokoyama, including Tetsujin 28 (Gigantor).

Spin-off OVAs.

The Giant Robo OVA series spun off into three 30-minute videos (thought to be produced to distract the fans during the last-episode hiatus of the original), all of them starring the beautiful secret agent GinRei (  ). The plots and situations of these episodes are more comedy-oriented and tongue-in-cheek than the original series. These videos are:

Barefoot GinRei Episode.1 Find the stolen Chinese Dress!! (1994);
(Japanese Title:    GinRei Episode.1                 !!)

Steel-Armed Ginrei Episode.23 Forbidden Fruit ~ War in Heaven!! (1995);
(Japanese Title:   GinRei Epidode.23                 !!)

GinRei with Blue Eyes (1995) (Japanese Title:       );

On May 17, 2005, these videos were released officially on DVD by Media Blasters Studio.

The 2007 Series.

A third Giant Robo series consisting of 13 episodes will begin being broadcast in the spring of 2007. It was reported that a 2nd or 3rd season would follow sometime 2008. Souce.

Ben Franklin in Paris is a Broadway musical with a book and lyrics by Sidney Michaels and music by Mark Sandrich, Jr.. Additional songs were contributed by Jerry Herman.


The story is a somewhat fictionalized account of Benjamin Franklin's adventures in the French capital. Seeking support for the Colonies' war against England, he arrives in Paris, where he enlists the aid of an old friend, Madame La Comtesse Diane de Vobrillac, a confidante to King Louis XVI. Franklin's hopes of winning the king's support seem dashed when British forces capture Philadelphia but rally when the Colonists are victorious at Saratoga. At home, his son William, the governor of New Jersey, sides with the enemy, and the traitorous act upsets the elder Franklin's plans. To regain the upper hand, he offers to marry Diane, but she rejects him. Knowing he faces death by hanging, Franklin nevertheless decides to go to England, hoping his act of martyrdom will win him  posthumous support. Diane learns of the plan and intercedes with the King, who eventually welcomes Franklin in his new position of the Ambassador of the United States of America to France.


After 13 previews, the show - directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd - opened on October 27, 1964 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it ran for 215 performances. The cast included Robert Preston and Susan Watson. Michaels was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Author of a Musical. 

An original cast recording was released by Capitol Records.

Voorne-Putten is an island between the North Sea, the Brielse meer and the rivers Oude Maas, Spui and Haringvliet in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. Voorne-Putten consists of the two former islands Voorne (the larger, western part) and Putten (the smaller, eastern part). Since a few years they are separated again by the river Bernisse, which has been dredged. The North Sea coast of Voorne is a valuable nature reserve (sand dunes). The rest of the island is a mostly agricultural region. The largest town, Spijkenisse, in the east of the island, is more or less a suburb of Rotterdam. 

Voorne-Putten consists of the following municipalities:

 Bernisse (towns Geervliet and Heenvliet, villages Abbenbroek, Oudenhoorn and Zuidland);
 Brielle (town Brielle, villages Vierpolders and Zwartewaal);
 Hellevoetsluis;
 Spijkenisse (town Hekelingen);
 Westvoorne (villages Oostvoorne, Rockanje and Tinte);

Voorne-Putten is separated
from the island of Rozenburg on the north by the Brielse meer (dam and bridge);
from IJsselmonde island on the north-east by the Oude Maas (bridge and metro tunnel);
from Hoeksche Waard island on the south-east by the Spui (ferry);
from Goeree-Overflakkee island on the south by Haringvliet (dam);

Talena A. L. Atfield (born January 14, 1983) is a Canadian bass guitar player. She is 5.6 ft tall. She has played in Kittie, Why she left Kittie: the official statements:The band states "We are so sad and disappointed that Talena chose to leave the band. We wish she would have stayed with us, but we view it as an opportunity for a new beginning and promise our fans a more mature and ferocious band with the addition of Arroyo on bass." 

There are many rumors about why Talena left the band, as there are with Fallon, but this is what was quoted by Talena on her official message board:

"I would like to clear something up, the money wasn't an issue for me and that was not the reason for my departure, they replaced me before I even left. They gave me an ultimatum, to sign something I was unable to sign because it did not benefit me in the least and did not give me control over myself, they said to sign it or leave because they had already found someone new to play bass. And that right there was enough for me to decide on, if they could replace me that quickly without even talking to me then they obviously didn't want me there anyways. They can state whatever reasons they want for me leaving. They don't even know why because they never even called me to talk to me about it, they had Jeff call me to tell me the news, and I am sure it makes them look better if I am a "money grubbing whore" or so they have been saying." -TALENA ATFIELD

According to Morgan and Mercedes, they had called Talena's house to set up band practice for the up coming tour and her father told them that she did not want to be in the band any more. According to the two sisters, they had no intentions of kicking her out of the band.  They were very surprised that Talena had to get her dad to tell them she was quitting the band.  

Talena was forced to return a BC Rich Custom Widow 5-stringed bass when she had left Kittie, but still has shown an extreme liking for the ESP-LTD bass line series which she later sold on e-Bay to a fan by the name Nick aka misfits

Allegedly, it was also revealed earlier in 2005 that Talena didn't play many of her bass lines on Oracle.  Her tracks were sloppy and Morgan later fixed them at the request of producer Garth Richardson.

Talena is currently a member of Amphibious Assault along with former Kittie member Fallon Bowman. Together they both have left the world of hard rock in favor of the industrial sound.

 Talena is named after a princess from John Norman's "Chronicles of Gor" book series that her father read. ;
 She currently lives in London, Ontario. ;
 She has a younger brother named Griffin. ;

Mummy Mountain is the second highest peak of the Spring Mountains in Nevada.

It takes its name from its vague resemblance to a mummy, or perhaps more accurately an Egyptian sarcophagus seen in profile, with the "head" to the north formed by outcropping above Lee Canyon, the gently rounded main summit forming the "body", and a southern rise and cliffs forming the "feet". This appearance is especially prominent from U.S. Route 95, which passes by the mountain to the east.

The usual route to the summit is from the North Loop Trail to Mount Charleston, starting from where it reaches close to the top of the ridge between Mummy and Charleston. A steep scramble up a scree slope reaches the top of the ridge, where a faint climber's trail leads east to the base of the summit cliffs. The route then jogs north to a chute leading to the broad and flat summit plateau.

Ranunculus lapponicus (the Lapland buttercup) is distributed all over the arctic, with the exception of northern and eastern Greenland.

It is a low, prostrate plant with a creeping, underground stem (rhizome) which sends out long stalks and shoots bearing the flowers. The leaves are deeply tripartite, forming 3 lobes which are toothed or crenated. The flowers are yellow, solitary, generally having 6 (8) petals that are distinctly longer than the sepals. After flowering, the fruit forms a globular head of carpels held above the creeping plant. 

It grows in wet localities, especially in moss carpets along beaches, streams and lakes.

Interchange File Format (IFF), is a generic file format originally introduced by the Electronic Arts company in 1985 (in cooperation with Commodore-Amiga) in order to ease transfer of data between software products produced by different companies.  

IFF files do not have any common extension. Most files with .iff extension are in fact ILBM files, wrongly named so because they are most common IFF files and most assume that they are the only type of IFF files (on many systems that produce IFF files, file extensions are not important).

Structure.

An IFF file is built up from chunks. Each chunk begins with what the spec calls a "Type ID" (what the Macintosh called an OSType and Windows developers might call a FourCC). This is followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer (all integers in IFF files' structure are big-endian) specifying the size of the following data (the chunk content) in bytes. Because the spec includes explicit lengths for each chunk, it is possible for a parser to skip over chunks which it either can't or doesn't care to process. 

There are predefined group chunks, with type IDs  FORM ,  LIST  and  CAT  . A FORM chunk is like a record structure, containing a type ID (indicating the record type) followed by nested chunks specifying the record fields. A LIST is a factoring structure containing a series of  PROP  (property) chunks plus nested group chunks to which those properties apply. A CAT  is just a collection of nested chunks with no special semantics. Group chunks can contain other group chunks, depending on the needs of the application. Group chunks, like their simpler counterparts, contain a length element. Skipping over a group can thus be done with a simple Unix-style relative seek operation.

Chunks must begin on even file offsets, as befits the origins of IFF on the Motorola 68000 processor, which couldn't address quantities larger than a byte on odd addresses. Thus a chunk following an odd-length chunk will be preceded by a pad byte.

The top-level structure of an IFF file consists of exactly one of the group chunks: FORM, LIST or CAT .

Each type of chunk typically has different internal structure, that could be numerical data, text, or raw data. It is also possible to include other IFF files as if they are chunks (note that they have the same structure: four letters followed with length) and some formats use this. There are standard chunks that could be present in any IFF file, such as  AUTH  (containing text with information about author of the file),  ANNO  (containing text with annotation, usually name of the program that created the file),  NAME  (containing text with name of the work in the file),  VERS  (containing file version),  (c)   (containing text with copyright information). There are also chunks that are common among a number of formats, such as  CMAP  which holds color palette in ILBM, ANIM and DR2D files (pictures, animations and vector pictures). There are chunks that have common name but hold different data such as  BODY  which could store image in an ILBM file and sound in an 8SVX file. And finally, there are chunks unique to their file type. Some programs that create IFF files add to them chunks with their internal data; these same files can later be read by other programs without any disruption (because their parsers could skip uninteresting chunks) which is a great advantage of IFF and similar formats.

As a nestable, descriptive file format, there are architectural similaries to XML. XML, however, is primarily a text format, whereas all IFF contains at least some binary data (the length fields). It is possible to mechanically convert IFF to an XML equivalent; however, XML has additional features such as descriptive data and metadata (attributes, entities, DTD's and schemas) and navigational features (xpath) which cannot be trivially mapped back to IFF.

List of common IFF-based file formats.
8SVX (Audio format);
ACBM (Amiga Contiguous BitMap - Image format for very fast loading/saving);
AIFF (Audio format);
ANBM ((obsolete) animation format, interally a set of ILBMs to be displayed one-after-another);
ANIM (Animation format);
BIFF8 (formerly used by Microsoft Excel);
Alias/Wavefront Maya file format (both image and scene description);
Word document (pre Word 97 format);
DjVu (Image format for high resolution compound documents);
DR2D;
EMOD (QuadraComposer module format);
FNTR (Raster font);
FNTV (Vector font);
FTXT (Text format);
GSCR (apocryphal (?) General music Score);
IFRS (known as Blorb);
IFZS (known as Quetzal);
ILBM (Raster image format);
PDEF (Deluxe Print page definition);
PICS (Macintosh QuickDraw picture encapsulated in IFF format);
PLBM ((obsolete) picture format);
SHRI;
SMUS (Simple Music format, similar to MIDI format);
USCR (Uhuru Sound music score);
UVOX (Uhuru Sound voice);
VDEO (Deluxe Video Construction Set video);
YAFA (Animation Format);

Clones and variants of the IFF format.
 RIFF is a variant of IFF format devised by Microsoft and IBM; RIFF files differ from IFF files in that they have letters RIFF at the beginning and use little-endian integers. WAV files, for example, are RIFFs. A big-endian version, RIFX, has also been defined but found no significant use.
 AVI files are also RIFF-based;
 The TIFF file format was designed by Aldus to include high-depth bitmaps with PostScript.  It has a chunked structure similar to IFF, however the image format itself has no relationship to the ILBM format.
 The Standard MIDI File format takes the key concepts of IFF without actually using the IFF standard.
 The PNG file format takes the concept of chunks from IFF, but does not copy the exact structure.
 QuickTime (.mov) files (and hence the derived MPEG-4 files) took the same concept of chunks from IFF, but calls them 'atoms' and uses a different layout. They also have extensions for chunks over 4GB in size.

Stranorlar (Srath an Urláir in Irish) is a small town in County Donegal which forms one of the "twin towns" of Stranorlar/Ballybofey on either side of the River Finn.

For nearly 100 years, Stranorlar was the headquarters of the County Donegal Railway system (originally, the Finn Valley Railway), with services to Derry and Letterkenny via Strabane (near Castlefin), to Ballyshannon and Killybegs via Donegal, and to Glenties. At its peak the railway had 130 employees. The last train ran from Stranorlar in 1961.

Stranorlar is home to Stranorlar Vocational School and St. Columbas College, both highly rated secondary schools. There is an interesting old Church of Ireland church, the Catholic church of St Mary's, and there are 2 Presbyterian churches. Finn Valley Athletics Club has its track in the town. There is an excellent 18 hole golf course and fine game fishing in the river Finn, and nearby is the Lough Alann bird sanctuary.

There is an old rhyme which goes "Belmafey for drinkin' tae, Stranorlar for drinking brandy."

Jengish Chokusu  is the highest mountain in the Tian Shan mountain range. It lies on the Kyrgyzstan-China border, in the Kokshaal-Too subrange, the highest part of the Tien Shan, southeast of lake Issyk Kul.

 Names .
The mountain's official name in Kyrgyz is Jengish Chokosu, which means "Independence". During the Soviet era its Russian name was Pik Pobedy (or Peak Pobeda), meaning "Victory Peak". In Uighur, it is called Tömür, which is also the official name of the mountain in China. The Chinese name Tu mù' r F ng      is a transcription of the Uighur. 

 Description .
Jengish Chokusu is a massif, with several summits along its lengthy ridge. Only its main summit breaks 7,000 m. It is located 16 km (10 miles) southwest of Khan Tengri (7,010 m / 22,998 ft), separated by the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, where base camps for both mountains are usually located. The massif runs at right angles to the glaciers it spills into three alpine valleys on the north (Kyrgyzstan), all eventually running to the Engilchek glacier, the largest in the Tian Shan. Its main summit is usually approached from the Zvozdochka (Russian for "little star") glacier, which is coloured red with rocks from Jengish Chokusu.

Records.
Jengish Chokusu is the highest mountain in the Tian Shan, and the highest one in Kyrgyzstan. Jengish Chokusu has the most northerly 7,000-metre rock in the world, and by geologists is considered the most northerly 7,000-metre mountain. (Because mountains often contain ice caps on top of rock, mountaineers consider Khan Tengri, the Tian Shan's second highest peak, as the northernmost 7,000-metre summit.)

The South Inylchek (Enylchek) Glacier and its side glaciers occupy the entire north side of Peak Jengish Chokusu.  This glacier, currently at 62 km in length, is the fourth longest outside of the world's polar regions. 

History.
Although Jengish Chokusu is almost 1,500 ft higher, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu's survey in 1946. Jengish Chokusu's first verified ascent was in 1956 by Vitaly Abalakov's party though there are unsubstantiated reports of a successful 1939 attempt as well. The mountain was renamed Victory (Pobeda) Peak short after the USSR's victory in the Great Patriotic War (World War II). It was officially renamed Jengish Chokusu after Kyrgyz Independence but retains Pobeda as its colloquial name.

The first winter ascent of the peak was made by Valery Khrichtchatyi in February 1990.

<doc id="8340321" title="Liz Lemon" nonfiltered="117" processed="115" dbindex="1480117">


Elizabeth "Liz" Lemon is a fictional character played by Tina Fey on the American television series 30 Rock.

Personal history.


In "Jack Meets Dennis," Liz stated that she was from somewhere called "White Haven," possibly referring to White Haven, Pennsylvania, and dialogue in the episodes "Tracy Does Conan" and "Jack Meets Dennis" suggest she was born around November, 1971. In college, she studied theater tech. She and Jenna Maroney knew each other well as early as 1996 and together dreamed of making it big. They shared an apartment in a Chicago neighborhood called "Little Armenia" and began The Girlie Show on Second City. At that time, the show apparently starred both of them.

Liz and Jenna worked for years to turn The Girlie Show into a television series, the pair of them even having to move from Chicago to New York City for it. Liz became the head writer and apparently the unofficial show runner for The Girlie Show while Jenna became the show's main star. It is not known when the television version of The Girlie Show started, but it was apparently after the year 2000 and the show had evidently run long enough to successfully find a fanbase by the time of the pilot episode. Liz and the writers apparently had a good relationship with their boss Gary, who was stated to love the show and be pleased with the ratings.

However, Gary's death is announced in the pilot and Jack Donaghy takes his place. Jack immediately decides to retool the show to make it appeal to a larger demographic, starting by firing her trusted producer Pete Hornberger and making her hire unpredictable actor Tracy Jordan as the show's new star. Liz manages to convince Jack to re-hire Pete, but Jack is insistent on making the show center around Tracy and, much to Liz's chagrin, he renames the show TGS with Tracy Jordan.

Personality.
Jack's overview.
Liz Lemon is presumably a parody of Tina Fey herself or, possibly, her media image. In the pilot episode, Jack, at a mere glance, described her, apparently accurately, as a "New York third-wave feminist, college-educated, single-and-pretending-to-be-happy-about-it, overscheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says 'healthy body image' on the cover and every two years you take up knitting for...a week." Pete said that the "knitting" part, in particular, was uncanny.

Physical appearance and typical attire.
In contrast with her friend and likely foil Jenna Maroney, Liz seems to have little interest in stereotypical female interests such as fashion. Her "bi-curious" shoes led Jack to erroneously think she was gay and set her up on a blind date with his friend Gretchen Thomas, the "brilliant plastics engineer/lesbian" in "Blind Date." Except when she is pressured to dress more femininely, she appears in unfashionable, gender-neutral attire. Due to this, Jack very clearly does not find her at all attractive, as he repeatedly makes clear through backhanded compliments.

Liz almost always appears wearing plastic-rimmed glasses and the flashbacks from the episode "Blind Date" reveal that she has worn glasses since she was about four or five at least. However, according to Jenna in "The Rural Juror," she does not actually need glasses. This is probably intended to parody the fact that plastic-rimmed glasses are considered to be Tina Fey's trademark in real life, despite the fact that she does not actually need glasses except to see far away.

Quirks and interests.
Liz is generally portrayed as something of a geek, so, although apparently a skilled writer, she seems to have precious few social skills, as demonstrated in "The Break-Up" where, while she was trying to meet a date at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken and she asked him why she should move her coat just so he could sit there. She is apparently a fan of Star Wars (often using events from the original trilogy to explain her feelings and actions in daily life) and Heroes ("I like the Japanese dude."), and her drink of choice is Pinot Grigio ("Blind Date", "The Head and the Hair"). She is allergic to dogs and has evidently won at least one Emmy Award. Liz also speaks fluent German.

Liz has a strong aversion to unfairness and breaking rules as demonstrated in the opening scene of the pilot, where, when a man cheats to get a hot dog from a hot dog stand more quickly by "creating" a new line which several people from the "original" line promptly join, she responds by buying all the hot dogs and giving them to the "good people" who stayed in the original line. Later, when Liz considered quitting over Jack's changes to the show, Pete told her that she had the best job in New York and that she shouldn't, in his words, "buy all the hot dogs."

She also seems to have a weakness when it comes to maternal instincts. In "The Baby Show," the day after Liz told Jenna that she wanted to have children, she found herself bombarded with offers from people who wanted to be sperm donors or surrogates for her. Liz was also asked by a makeup artist to hold her baby daughter while she was doing touch ups on Jenna, but, after leaving Jenna's dressing room, Liz blacked out and found herself standing in her apartment, still holding the baby in her arms, thanks to the baby's hypnotic effect on her.

Political beliefs.
As demonstrated in several encounters with Jack, she seems to have left-wing politics and is most likely a Democrat. In "Jack-tor," she is shown to be somewhat afflicted with "white guilt," which Tracy uses to manipulate her in the episode. She later says that her white guilt "is to be used only for good, like overtipping and supporting Barack Obama."

Relationships.
Jenna Maroney.
Liz stated in the pilot that she and Jenna worked for years to get The Girlie Show and a series of flashbacks in "The Rural Juror" reveal that Liz and Jenna have known each other since at least 1996, having been roomates together in a Chicago neighborhood called "Little Armenia". Given Jenna's uptight nature, Liz is generally forced to act as her rock. This has caused Liz some annoyance, especially after Jack increased Jenna's stress level and paranoia by hiring Tracy and changing the show's name.

Liz has been seen complaining about Jenna's erratic tendencies behind her back, usually with Pete. In "The Aftermath," Jenna got mad at Liz when she overheard Liz describe her to Tracy as being "paranoid" and "neurotic." Jenna once slept with Liz's brother Mitch and said he was terrible in bed. (Liz says Mitch hasn't been right since he was in some kind of skiing accident.)

Pete Hornberger.
Liz and Pete have known each other since about 1996 and he's possibly the closest thing Liz has to a confidant, especially since Jenna, her closest female friend, is far too anxious about her own life to function as such. Liz seems to have more genuine respect for him than anyone else on the show.

Tracy Jordan.
Liz has not really tried to pursue a relationship of any kind with Tracy, preferring to focus her energies on keeping his craziness in check. She is typically friendly towards him, though mainly to further this end. She refers to him by his first name, whereas he calls her by her last name, "Lemon," or by her full name, "Liz Lemon."

Jack Donaghy.
Liz, unsurprisingly, does not particularly like Jack Donaghy, though, to his face, she is generally respectful of his authority, though she has dared to be rather sarcastic on a few occasions, most notably when first meeting him in the pilot. The degree of her dislike for him tends to vary from time to time. Like Tracy, he usually refers to her as "Lemon." When addressing him, she usually calls him "sir," though, if he's being particularly intimate, which he has tendency to be, she has been known to call him by his first name. When referring to him, she has been shown to call by his first name, last name or full name.

Love life.

According to Pete in "Blind Date," Liz has had some really terrible boyfriends in the ten years that he's known her. She apparently used to date Conan O'Brien, who told Liz that he wants to forget their brief relationship. Liz was dating Dennis Duffy, her on-again-off-again boyfriend, until the episode "The Break Up," in which she learned that he was an online sexual predator after seeing him on Dateline NBC, where he was caught in one of their hidden camera investigations.

In "The Head and the Hair," Liz and Jenna considered hooking up with two men who they had nicknamed "The Head" and "The Hair," referring to one them being intelligent, but lacking good looks and vice-versa. However, Liz was surprised when she was approached by "The Hair" (whose real name turned out to be Gray) since she had assumed that she was meant for "The Head." Despite a rocky start, their relationship went fairly well until Liz and Gray discovered that they were third cousins.

List of pros and cons on Dennis.
 
In "The Break Up", Jenna suggests that Liz make a list of pros and cons about Dennis to help her to decide to break up with him or not. Her pros and cons on him were as follows:


 Pros;
 Basically nice;
 Takes good care of his feet;
 Makes good chili;
 Remembers my birthday;
 Rarely wants to do it;
 Is funny when he goofs on his friends;
 Doesn't care about money;
 Loyal;
 Too lazy to cheat;
 Would increase likelihood of blue-eyed kids;
 Loves The Simpsons;
 Has good hair;
 Has already seen me throw up twice;
 Fixed TV;
 Jack likes Dennis;

 Cons;
 Not super smart;
 Listens to Winger;
 Dental hygiene;
 Wears acid wash denim;
 Always wants foot rubs;
 Not much money;
 Catholic;
 Doesn't like his mother;
 I don't like his mother;
 His mother doesn't like me;
 Loves Family Guy;
 Reads The Post;
 Insists on spending holidays with his mother;
 Has already seen me throw up;
 Attempted three-way;
 Racist;
 Wears Italian cross even though Irish;
 Jack likes Dennis;
 Sexual predator  ;


    After seeing the NBC Dateline show, Liz writes his appearance on it as a con but the camera never shows exactly what she writes but surely is about him being a sexual predator of a minor.

Her name.
Interestingly, her full first name, Elizabeth, is also Tina Fey's full first name, though Conan O'Brien is, so far, the only "character" to refer to her as "Elizabeth" rather than "Liz." Her last name, "Lemon," is apparently intended to imply an acerbic personality and possibly also to make her full name alliterative.

Equity feminism is a phrase coined by Christina Hoff Sommers in her book Who Stole Feminism? (Simon & Schuster, 1994) as opposed to the term gender feminism. It's used to describe an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality and distinguish it from the term gender feminism, which she uses to describe the idea of much of modern academic feminist theory and the feminist movement which aims at the total abolition of gender roles and structure of the society which they claim is still dominated by patriarchal structures. Hoff Sommers considers this as gynocentrism and misandry that she feels is dominant in the contemporary feminist movement. Christina Hoff Sommers argues, "Most American women subscribe philosophically to the older 'First Wave' kind of feminism whose main goal is equity, especially in politics and education" . Although she realizes that her views are not mainstream in academia or the feminist movement in general, she considers them mainstream among the US population of women .

Caso Cerrado is a Latin American television "judge show" broadcasted on Telemundo and hosted by Cuban judge Ana María Polo.  The show was previously called Sala de Parejas (Couple's Court) in 2005.  

In the show, Polo presented several cases between conflicting guests and she tries to solve the situations as an arbitrator. Her function on the show is not that of a judge but an arbitrator who settles differences between her guests (the litigants).

The guests of the show all come voluntarily and are requested to sign legally binding contracts before appearing. The decisions she makes are legally binding and can be legally enforced.

In hydrology, moisture recycling or precipitation recycling refer to the process by which a portion of the precipitated water that evapotranspired from a given area contributes to the precipitation over the same area. Moisture recycling is thus a component of the hydrologic cycle. The ratio of the locally derived precipitation () to total precipitation () is known as the recycling ratio, : .

The recycling ratio is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between land surface hydrology and regional climate . Land use changes, such as deforestation or agricultural intensification, have the potential to change the amount of precipitation that falls in a region. The recycling ratio for the entire world is one, and for a single point is zero. Estimates for the recycling ratio for the Amazon basin range from 24% to 56%, and for the Mississippi basin from 21% to 24% .

The Canadian Environmental Protection Act of 1999 is "An Act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and human health in order to contribute to sustainable development."

The goal of the renewed Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) is to contribute to sustainable development through pollution prevention and to protect the environment, human life and health from the risks associated with toxic substances. 

CEPA also recognises the contribution of pollution prevention and the management and control of toxic substances and hazardous waste to reducing threats to Canada's ecosystems and biological diversity. 

It acknowledges for the first time the need to virtually eliminate the most persistent toxic substances that remain in the environment for extended periods of time before breaking down and bioaccumulative toxic substances that accumulate within living organisms. 

Health Canada works in partnership with Environment Canada to assess potentially toxic substances and to develop regulations to control toxic substances. Some of the highlights of the new act include:

Petar Brzica was a Croatian fascist and World War II war criminal. He was a member of the Croatian fascist Usta¨a organization and one of the guards in the Jasenovac concentration camp. He is known for having been the winner of a slaughtering contest, in which he killed about 1300 concentration camp prisoners in a single night, using a curve-bladed knife.

After World War II he fled to the United States. Yugoslav authorities were never able to capture him and he most likely changed his identity and died hidden. His name was on a list of 59 Nazis living in the US given by a Jewish organization to the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the 1970s. As of 2006, Brzica has remained unrevealed.

A heuristic is a replicable method or approach for directing one's attention in learning, discovery, or problem-solving. It is originally derived from the Greek "heurisko" (), which means "I find". (A form of the same verb is found in Archimedes' famous exclamation "eureka!"   "I have found !") The term was introduced in the 4th century CE by Pappus of Alexandria.

The study of heuristics is sometimes called heuristic, but more often called heuristics. Heuristics, in this sense, is treated as a singular, like physics or mathematics.

The mathematician George Pólya popularized heuristics in the mid 20th century, in his book How to Solve It. He learned mathematical proofs as a student but he did not know, nor was he taught, the ways mathematicians arrived at such proofs. How to Solve It is a collection of ideas about heuristics that he taught to mathematics students   ways of looking at problems and formulating solutions.

How to Solve It describes the following common and simple heuristics, which serve as useful illustrative examples:
 If you are having difficulty understanding a problem, try drawing a picture.
 If you can't find a solution, try assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that ("working backward").
 If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example.
 Try solving a more general problem first (the "inventor's paradox": the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success).

The word is used adjectivally ("Is it heuristic?") in relation to research or intellectual pursuits.  For example, a good theory or idea may be heuristic in that it attempts to find something out or stimulates further investigation.  When criticizing theories in the sciences good theories tend to be heuristic.

Psychology.
In psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, hard-coded by evolutionary processes or learned, which have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgments, and solve problems, typically when facing complex problems or incomplete information. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases lead to systematic cognitive biases.

For instance, people may tend to perceive more expensive beers as tasting better than inexpensive ones. This finding holds true even when prices and brands are switched; putting the high price on the normally relatively inexpensive brand is enough to lead subjects to perceive it as tasting better than the beer that is normally more expensive. One might call this "price implies quality" bias. (Cf. Veblen good.)

Much of the work of discovering heuristics in human decision-makers was ignited by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who together had an important influence on behavioral finance. Critics led by Gerd Gigerenzer focus on how heuristics can be used to make judgments that are in principle accurate, rather than producing cognitive biases   heuristics that are "fast and frugal".

Philosophy.
In philosophy, especially in Continental European philosophy, the adjective "heuristic" (or the designation "heuristic device") is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a model, which, as it is never identical with what it models, is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of utopia as described in Plato's best-known work, The Republic. This means that the "ideal city" as depicted in the The Republic is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously.

Law.
In legal theory, especially in the theory of law and economics, heuristics are used in the law when case-by-case analysis would be impractical.

For instance, in the United States the legal drinking age is 21, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of alcohol consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether one individual is mature enough that society can trust them with that kind of responsibility.

The same reasoning applies to patent law. Patents are justified on the grounds that inventors need to be protected in order to have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that, in society's best interest, inventors should be issued with a temporary government-granted monopoly on their product, so that they can recoup their investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period of time. In the United States the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the application for patent was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product in order to be efficient; but a 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including Lawrence Lessig, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries   such as software patents   should be protected for different lengths of time.

In computer science, a heuristic is a technique
designed to solve a problem that ignores whether the solution can be proven to be correct, but which usually produces a good solution or solves a simpler problem that contains or intersects with the solution of the more complex problem.

Heuristics are intended to gain computational performance or conceptual simplicity, potentially at the cost of accuracy or precision.

 Human-computer interaction .
In human-computer interaction, heuristic evaluation is a usability-testing technique devised by expert usability consultants. In heuristic evaluation, the user interface is reviewed by experts and its compliance to ten usability heuristics (broadly stated characteristics of a good user interface) is assessed, and any violating aspects are recorded.

Gul Zaman is a citizen of Afghanistan, held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, in Cuba.
His detainee ID number is 459.

Gul Zaman is the son of Abib Sarajuddin, and the nephew of Khan Zaman.  The three of them, and their neighbor, Mohammad Gul, were captured on January 21 2002.
Gul Zaman, and Abib Sarajuddin, were released.  Mohammad Gul and Khan Zaman were confirmed to have been correctly classified as "enemy combatants.

Combatant Status Review Tribunal.


Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror.  This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status.

Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.  The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant.

Zaman chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

allegations.

The allegations Gul Zaman faced during his Tribunal were:

The detainee traveled from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia in 2001.
The detainee utilized counterfeit travel documents for his travel to Saudi Arabia.
The detainee returned to Afghanistan at the time the Northern Alliance recaptured Kabul.
The detainee's family and village members stated an important Taliban member used the detainee's father's guesthouse.
The detainee lives with his father, Haji Sarajudeen.
The detainee's father worked as a recruiter for Pacha Khan.
Pacha Khan, a renegade Pashtun Commander, has been conducting military operations against the Afghan Transitional Administration (ATA) and coalition foces.
The detainee stated he owns one or two Kalashnikov rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition.
The detainee was captured with communications equipment.
The detainee admits seeing this type of equipment in the possession of Taliban members.
Coalition forces were fired upone during the capture of the detainee and three associates.

testimony.

Gul Zaman acknowledged that he had traveled to Saudi Arabia, to work, but that he traveled on a legal passport.  

He returned for personal reasons.  His return had nothing to do with the recapture of Kabul.

He denied that his father had hosted any Taliban leaders.  He pointed out that he was still in Saudi Arabia at the time his father's house was bombed.

He said that Pasha Khan had asked Mohammed Nasim, a tribal elder, to ask his father to go around to local villages to rally support against the Taliban, during the period when the Taliban was falling.  He said his father didn't work directly for Pasha Khan.

He said he had no knowledge of Pasha Khan going renegade.  At the time of his capture Khan was supporting the Americans, and enjoyed their support.  A February 2 2002 New York Times article describes Pasha Khan competing with another local leader for the American's endorsement of authority over the city of Khost.

He acknowledged that his family owned a rifle.  Owning weapons was one of the traditional privileges granted by the former kings of Afghanistan to their isolated border district.

He denied that anyone in their area owned a radio transmitter.  He acknowledged that, during the Taliban regime, he had seen Taliban officials using communications devices.

He denied hearing or seeing any firing on the night he was captured.
witnesses.

Gul Zaman called two witnesses, his uncle Khan Zaman and his neighbor Mohammad Gul.

Khan Zaman's testimony.

Khan Zaman confirmed that Gul Zaman traveled to Saudi Arabia, on a legal Pakistani passport.  
He confirmed that Gul Zaman returned around the time Kabul was recaptured, but that this had
nothing to do with the timing of his return.  He confirmed that he returned for personal and 
family reasons.

Khan Zaman denied that Gul Zaman's father Abib Sarajuddin had ever hosted Jalaluddin.

Khan Zaman confirmed that Sarajuddin had gone around to neighboring villages, trying to rally 
opposition to the Taliban.  He confirmed that Pasha Khan had requested this of a tribal Elder
Nasim.  He stated that, at this time, Pasha Khan was working with the Americans.

Khan Zaman confirmed that they did not have a radio of any kind in their household.
He said his interrogators showed him a picture of a radio of the kind that American
records said was captured in their household.  He said he had never seen this kind
of radio before in his life.

Khan Zaman denied hearing or seeing any weapons fire on the night they were captured.

Khan Zaman confirmed that they owned a rifle, and that the inhabitants of their isolated district had
traditionally been allowed to own a rifle.

In answer to questioning from the Recorder Khan Zaman confirmed that they lived in an area called
Zani Khel.  But he said it was the name of the area of their tribe, not the name of their village.
Their house was midway between two villages, Shamawat and Khojari.

Khan Zaman was asked if he was familiar with the names Wazir Khan Zadran and Zakim Khan.  These two names were mentioned in the February 2 2002 New York Times article.  One was the brother of Pacha Khan.  The other was his rival for US support for authority over Khost.

Khan Zaman was asked if the village elder Nasim had a relationship with Pacha Khan.  He confirmed that they had both been commanders under an anti-Taliban commander named Pir.

Khan Zaman described how Afghans who had been refugees were able to travel legally on Pakistani passports.

Khan Zaman explained he wasn't caught in the attack on the family home because he was in Gardez that day.  He said Gul Zaman was still in Saudi Arabia.  He said their capture came a month and a half to two and half months following the aerial bombardment destroyed their home.  He said at the time of their capture they had been loaned another home.

Mohammad Gul's testimony.

Mohammad Gul confirmed that Gul Zaman arrived back in the village after he did, and he had arrived back after the American air strike against Gul Zaman's father's house.
He confirmed that there were no radio transmitters in the village.
He confirmed that he did not hear any firing on the night they were captured.
He described, in detail, how  an Afghan, could travel legally on a Pakistani passport.

Mohammad Gul described how Afghanistan had gone through decades of warfare, and that many Afghanis, including Gul Zaman and himself, had fled to Pakistan as refugees.  Pakistan had been willing to issue legal passports to Afghan refugees who could establish their identities.

Determined not to have been an Enemy Combatant.

The Washington Post reports that Zaman was one of 38 detainees who was determined not to have been an enemy combatant during his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.
They report that Zaman remains in detention.

Enchanted Rock is an enormous pink granite pluton just west of the Hill Country of central Texas in the United States. It is located in southern Llano County south of the Llano River, approximately 15 mi (24 km) north of Fredericksburg at . It covers approximately 640 acres (3 km²) and rises approximately 425 ft (130 m) above the surrounding terrain to elevation of 1,825 ft (550 m) above sea level. It the second largest such granite monadnock in the United States after Stone Mountain in Georgia. It is currently part of Enchanted Rock State Natural Area in the Texas state park system.  The natural area covers 1,644 acres.

Geology and History.
The prominent granite dome is visible for many miles in the surrounding basin of the Llano Uplift. Its gentle dome gives the appearance of being the edge of a pebble of leviathan proportions extruding from the earth, in the same manner as the larger Ayers Rock (or Uluru) in Australia. The rock is actually part of segmented ridge, the surface expression of a large igneous batholith of middle Precambrian material that intruded into earlier metamorphic schists and gneiss. The intrusive granite of the pluton was exposed by extensive erosion of the surrounding sedimentary rock (which is primarily limestone).

Archaeological evidence indicates human visitation at the rock going back at least 11,000 years. Folklore of local Native American tribes ascribes magical and spiritual powers to the rock (hence the name 'Enchanted Rock'). The first European to visit the area was probably Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1536. The Tonkawa, who inhabited the area in the 16th century, believed that ghost fires flickered at the top of the dome. In particular they heard unexplained creaking and groaning, which geologists attribute to the rock's night-time contraction after being heated by the sun during the day. The name "Enchanted Rock" derives from Spanish and Anglo-Texan interpretations of such legends and related folklore; the name "Crying Rock" has also been given to the formation. 


The rock has been the subject of numerous geological surveys and paintings. It was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1970. The rock was in private hands until 1978, when it was purchased by the Nature Conservancy. The State of Texas acquired it in 1979 and opened it as a park in 1984 after adding facilities. That same year it was also added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently one of the most popular destinations for hiking and camping in central Texas. Climbing footpaths to the top of the dome is a popular activity. Technical rock climbing is very popular there as well.

It is the most recently constituted district of  zmir, and has small guest houses and fish restaurants. Its most dramatic feature is the setting, with villages and orchards clinging to the steep rock slopes. There is a bus service in the area, although private vehicles offer more possibilities for exploring. The road is 100 km. (app. 60 miles) from Izmir city center. Since it is very narrow and curvy in some places it takes about 1 h. 45 m. by automobile. But it takes more than 2 hours by bus. The town is very quiet during winter. The winter population is about 2500. The area is famous for its olives, "kefal" (chelon labrosus - fish) and artichoke.

Timothy R. Tebow (born August 14 1987) is an American football quarterback for the Florida Gators. A highly-touted quarterback known for his ability to run and pass, Tebow chose Florida over the University of Alabama, the University of Michigan, the University of Southern California, and LSU. He is from Jacksonville, Florida, and played quarterback for Allen D. Nease Senior High School, where he became a highly touted Division I-A recruit and ranked among the top quarterback prospects in the nation. In his first season with the Gators, Tebow became an integral part of Urban Meyer's offense as backup to starter Chris Leak as well as a key player in certain situations, providing a hard-to-defend "dual threat" as both a runner and a passer. Coach Meyer has described Tebow as the "sparkplug" of the Gator offense, providing a much needed jolt at just the right time during the games. As a true freshman, Tim Tebow's contribution has helped the Gators win college football's 2007 national championship game for the first time since 1996.  

Biography.

All of the Tebow children were homeschooled by their mother who also worked to instill the family s deep religious beliefs along the way.  In 1996, legislation was passed in Florida allowing homeschooled students to compete in local high school sporting events. The law specifies that homeschool students may participate on the team of the local school in the county and school district in which they live.  The Tebows lived in Duval County and Tim played linebacker and tight end for Trinity Christian in Jacksonville for one season, but his dream was to play quarterback.  Trinity did not pass the ball much and Tim didn t want to hand it off every play, so he began to explore his options.  St. Augustine Nease liked to throw the ball and Coach Craig Howard was known for his passing offense so Tim and his mother moved in to an apartment down the street from the Nease High School in St. Johns County.  With the family farm up for sale in Jacksonville, Tim began playing quarterback for St. Augustine Nease High School and his performance soon began to turn some heads which even lead to a minor controversy over him being a homeschooled student. 

As a junior, Tebow s stock continued to rise as he became a high profile, highly recruited major college quarterback prospect.  The 6 3  225lb quarterback continued to impress during his senior season leading the Nease Panthers to a state title, earning All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a Parade All-American.  Tebow finished his high school career with 9,810 passing yards, 3,186 rushing yards, 95 passing touchdowns and 62 rushing touchdowns.  He played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl Game in San Antonio, Texas which features the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and is shown nationally on NBC television.

Despite having parental and sibling ties to the University of Florida, Tim remained open minded during the recruiting process and became very close to Alabama coach Mike Shula.  But after careful consideration and much deliberation, he decided to play for the team he felt best suited his skills and style of play.  Tebow chose to play for coach Urban Meyer and the Florida Gators, who employ a similar  spread option  offense that he excelled in at Nease High School.

Tebow was considered one of the nation s top recruits and was the subject of an ESPN  Faces in Sports  documentary.  The segment was titled "Tim Tebow: The Chosen One", and focused on Tim s homeschool controversy and missionary work in the Philippines, as well as his exploits on the field of play and the college recruiting process. Tim Tebow was also featured in Sports Illustrated on the  Faces in the Crowd  page.

Career as a Gator.
In Florida's 2006 "Orange and Blue" Spring scrimmage, Tebow completed 15 of 21 pass attempts for 197 yards and one touchdown. After the game, some Gator fans suggested that Tebow could be named the starting quarterback over current starter, Chris Leak. Coach Urban Meyer later stated that despite Tebow's impressive performance, Leak would remain the starting quarterback. 

Prior to the 2006 season, Tebow was listed by Sports Illustrated as college football's future top mobile quarterback.

Tebow made his college debut in a goal line situation against Southern Mississippi, rushing for a touchdown on a designed quarterback scramble.  He led the team in rushing in the next game, against Central Florida, and finished 2006 as the Gators' second-highest season rushing leader.

He made his SEC debut against the Tennessee Volunteers on September 16 2006. His performance included a ten-yard run on his first carry and converting a critical fourth down near the end of the game.

Tebow's biggest game to date came against the LSU Tigers on October 7 2006, where he accounted for all three of the Gators' touchdowns, passing for two and rushing for another. Tebow had a one-yard run on the goal line for his first score, a one-yard "jump pass" to tight end Tate Casey, in which he jumped in the air and double-pumped his arm before releasing the ball, and a 35-yard play-action pass to wide receiver Louis Murphy.

Tebow played a crucial role in the Gators' victory in the 2007 BCS National Championship game against Ohio State. He threw for one touchdown and rushed for another, accumulating 39 rush yards over the span of the game.

Tebow has been named as one of the "Breakout Players of 2007" for college football by Sporting News, and is the likely starter at quarterback for the Florida Gators in the 2007 season.

In mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology Alexander-Spanier cohomology is a cohomology theory arising from differential forms with compact support on a manifold. It is similar to and in some sense dual to de Rham cohomology. It is named for J. W. Alexander and Edwin Henry Spanier (1921-1996).

Given a manifold X, let  be the real vector space of k-forms on X with compact support, and d be the standard exterior derivative. 
Then the Alexander-Spanier cohomology groups  are the homology of the chain complex :

;

i.e.,  is the vector space of closed k-forms modulo that of exact k-forms.

Despite their definition as the homology of an ascending complex, the Alexander-Spanier groups demonstrate covariant behavior; for example, given the inclusion mapping for an open set U of X, extension of forms on U to X (by defining them to be 0 on X-U) is a map  inducing a map 

.

They also demonstrate contravariant behavior with respect to proper maps - that is, maps such that the inverse image of every compact set is compact. Let f: U   X be such a map; then the pullback



induces a map

.

A Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds for Alexander-Spanier cohomology.

<doc id="1144404" title="Taft-Katsura Agreement" nonfiltered="145" processed="143" dbindex="1480145">
The  was a secret diplomatic memorandum signed between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan Katsura Taro on 29 July 1905. In the agreement, the United States recognized Japan's sphere of influence in Korea; in exchange, Japan recognized the United States's sphere of influence in the Philippines. The agreement was not publicized until 1924, and was not a bilaterally signed document or secret treaty, but only a meeting memorandum meant to smooth over Japanese-American relations.

Details.
The Taft-Katsura Memorandum (also commonly called the Taft-Katsura Agreement) consists of the meeting notes containing portions of a long, confidential conversation between Japanese Prime Minister Katsura and US Secretary of War Taft held in Tokyo on the morning of 27 July 1905. The memorandum detailing these discussions was dated 29 July 1905. 

Three significant issues were discussed during the meeting: 

First were Katsura's views on peace in east Asia which according to him formed the fundamental principle of Japan's foreign policy and was best accomplished by a good understanding between Japan, the United States and Great Britain.

The second issue concerned the Philippines. On this, Taft observed that it was in Japan's best interests to have the Philippines governed by a strong and friendly nation like the United States; Katsura confirmed in the strongest terms that Japan had no aggressive designs on the Philippines. 

Finally, regarding Korea, Katsura observed that Korea was a matter of absolute importance to Japan, as Korea was the direct cause of the just concluded Russo-Japanese War. Katsura stated that a comprehensive solution of the Korea problem would be the war's logical outcome. Katsura further stated that if left alone, Korea would continue to improvidently enter into agreements/treaties with other powers which created the original problem. Therefore, Japan must take steps to prevent Korea from again creating conditions which would force Japan into fighting another foreign war. 

For his part, Secretary Taft concurred that the establishment of a Japanese protectorate over Korea would directly contribute to stability in east Asia. Taft also presented his belief that President Roosevelt would concur in his views in this regard.

This proviso clearly aimed at Imperial China, which until the Chinese-Japanese war of 1894/95 had Korea under his umbrella. With Russia beaten in the 1904/05 war and the US practicing benign neglect in the aftermath, the door was open for Japan to take control of Korea. Thus the Taft Katsura Agreement was at the beginning of Japanese colonial rule in Korea until Japan's defeat in WW II in 1945.

Korean reaction. 
Many Korean historians believe that the Taft-Katsura Agreement violated the  Korean-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce" signed at Incheon on 22 May 1882. The Joseon Government considered that treaty constituted a defacto mutual defense treaty while the Americans did not. As the Agreement paved the way for recognition of Japanese interests in Korea as later stated in the Treaty of Portsmouth, it can also be considered on of the direct causes of Korean colonization by Japan. Even today, while the Taft-Katsura Agreement is all but an obscure footnote in history, the Agreement is raised, in the present day (2006), by Korean activists in the media as an example of how the United States cannot be trusted with regards to Korean security and sovereignty issues.

Father James Edmund Groppi (November 16, 1930   November 4,1985) was a Roman Catholic priest and noted civil rights activist.

Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Italian immigrant parents, Groppi was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood in June of 1959, after studying at Mount Calvary Seminary (1950-1952) and St. Francis Seminary (1952-1959).

At first assigned to St. Veronica's Church in Milwaukee, in 1963 Groppi was transferred to St. Boniface, the latter parish having a predominantly African-American congregation.  It was then that Groppi became interested in - and active in - the cause of civil rights for black Americans, participating in the 1963 March on Washington and also the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 on behalf of the Voting Rights Act.  

Later in 1965, he returned to Milwaukee, where he began organizing protests against the segregation of Milwaukee public schools. Later he lead fair housing marches across the 16th Street Viaduct (since renamed in his honor) spanning the Menomonee River Valley. The 1/2 mile wide valley was considered to be a symbolic divide for the city.

In 1967, Groppi discovered that several judges in the Milwaukee area belonged to the Fraternal Order of Eagles, which at the time did not admit non-whites to its membership.  Groppi questioned how a judge who was a member of an organization that did not welcome African-Americans as members could rule impartially in cases involving African-Americans, and reacted by organizing pickets at the homes of some of the judges, most notably Circuit Court Judge Robert Cannon, despite the fact that Cannon was a liberal and had voiced opposition to the Eagles' membership policies.  These demonstrations continued, on and off, until 1969.  Also during this period, Groppi worked for passage of legislation which would outlaw discrimination in the buying and renting of homes (in 1968 such a law was passed on the federal level, known as the Fair Housing Act).

Groppi's ecclesiastical superiors did not always approve of his activities, and in 1970 transferred him to St. Michael's Church.  He then gradually became disenchanted with the priesthood, leaving it in 1976 to get married, eventually having a child as well.  In 1979 he became a bus driver for the Milwaukee Transit System - a job he had previously held in the 1950s to help put himself through the seminary and remained in that capacity until his death in 1985. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Milwaukee. His papers are at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

<doc id="19630" title="Man" nonfiltered="149" processed="147" dbindex="1480149">


A man is a male human.  The term man (irregular plural: men) is usually used for an adult, with the term boy being the usual term for a male child or adolescent (sometimes also applied to  childish adult men). However, the term is also used for a human regardless of age or sex, sometimes even extended to more primitive humanoids than the present species Homo sapiens, as in apeman.

Etymology.
The English term "Man" (from Proto-Germanic mannaz "man, person") and words derived therefrom can designate any or even all of the human race regardless of their gender or age. This is indeed the oldest usage of "Man" in English. This derives from a Proto-Indo-European root *man-" meaning hand. A similar cognate is Old Norse "mund", hand. The distinctive and dexterous hands of humans, compared to those of other animals, are the basis of this term and the similarly derived term, "manual" (from Latin "Manus", hand), by hand.

Age and terminology.
Manhood is the period in a male's life after he has transitioned from boyhood, at least physically, during puberty. Many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a man's coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of Christianity, bar mitzvah in Judaism, or even just the celebration of the eighteenth or twenty-first birthday, as in most Western societies.

A  boy is a male human child. For many, the word man implies a certain degree of maturity and responsibility that young men in particular often feel unprepared for; yet they may also feel too old to be called a boy. For this reason, many avoid using either man or boy to describe a young man and prefer colloquial terms such as bloke, lad, chap, fellow, guy or dude.

 Biology and gender . 


Humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, however most of these characteristic do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species. 

Some examples of male secondary sexual characteristics in humans, those acquired as boys become men or even later in life, are:
 deeper voice;
 taller height;
 facial hair or beard;
 growth of pubic hair and hair under arms and on chest;
 increased body size overall;
 less subcutaneous fat;
 increase in overall body hair;
 coarser skin;
 darker skin tone;
 penis grows larger;
 testicles grow larger and lower;
 A higher level of androgenic hormones such as testosterone, leading to increased muscle mass ;

The sex organs of a man are part of the reproductive system, consisting of the penis, testicles, vas deferens, and the prostate gland. The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation. The concept of fatherhood and family exists in human societies. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology. Most, but not all, men have the karyotype 46/XY.

In general, men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women. However, there are some sex-related illnesses that occur only, or more frequently, in men. For example, autism and color blindness are more common in men than women. As well, some age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease appear to be more common among men, though whether this is due to a genuinely higher incidence or because men have lower life expectancies than women is uncertain.

Twenty percent of males, particularly in the U.S., the Philippines, and South Korea, as well as Jews and Muslims from all countries, have experienced circumcision, a process of altering the penis from its natural state by removing the foreskin.

Biological factors are not always sufficient determinants of whether a person considers themselves a man or is considered a man. Intersexed men may have physical features that are more common in women. In addition female-to-male transgender or transsexual individuals are often considered men psychologically as well as in the social and legal senses (varying by district and culture) but are born with physiology that would be considered typicaly female.

Sexual characteristics.
In humans, the sex of an individual is generally determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell. If a sperm cell carrying an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be female (XX); if a sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY).  This is refered to as the XY sex-determination system and is typical of most mammals, but quite a few other sex-determination systems exist, including some that are non-genetic.  The term primary sexual characteristics denotes the kind of gamete the gonad produces: The ovary produces egg cells in the female, and the testis produces sperm cells in the male. The term secondary sexual characteristics denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs. Secondary sexual characteristics include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract, to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans, to behavioral features such as courtship.

Generally, the more highly evolved the species, the more elaborate are its secondary sexual characteristics. At the time the eggs of starfish ripen, the male merely releases great quantities of sperm cells into the ocean water, and a tiny but sufficient number of them find and penetrate distant eggs. Frogs and toads are drawn to mates by calls, and they spawn in water; the male makes cloacal contact with the female and releases sperm externally, simultaneously with the eggs. Terrestrial animals, especially mammals, which do not have an environment of water through which sperm can propel itself, rely on herding and flocking, courtship, competition among males, and more specialized genitalia including an erectile penis.

Sex hormones.
In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated embryo, testosterone stimulates the development of the Wolffian ducts, the penis, and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum.  Another significant hormone in sexual differeniation is the Anti-muellarian hormone, which inhibits development of the Müllerian ducts.

For males during puberty, testosterone, along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland, stimulates spermatogenesis, along with the full sexual distinction of a human male from a human female, while women are acted upon by estrogens and progesterones to produce their sexual distinction from the human male.

 Gender stereotypes .

Enormous debate in Western societies has focused on perceived social, intellectual, or emotional differences between men and women. These differences are very difficult to quantify for both scientific and political reasons. Below are a few stereotypical claims sometimes made about men in relation to women:

 More aggressive than women. However, in interpersonal relationships, most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive. Men do tend to be more aggressive outside of the home.
 More courageous and adventuresome than women.
 More competitive but also more stubborn than women.
 More self-confident (even proud) and exhibit better leadership skills than women.
 More self-controlled and less emotional.
 More spacially intelligent than than women, but less empathetic.
 More prone to abstract thinking than women.

Some of these differences have been supported by scientific research; others have not. For example, in interpersonal relationships, most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive. Men do tend to be more aggressive outside of the home. It is especially difficult and contentious for science to separate the "innate" or biological differences from the learned or social differences. All should be considered broad generalizations; that is, at least a large minority of either gender would fit better with the other gender in any one of these aspects.

A number of the above stereotypes were not perceived in the same way as today (i.e., their applications to particular aspects and spheres of life, such as work vs. home) until the 19th century, beginning with industrialization.

In terms of outward appearance, few men in Western cultures wear cosmetics or clothing generally associated with female gender roles. (Doing so is generally stigmatized and viewed as cross-dressing.)

It is claimed men on average have a higher IQ than women of around five points.

Culture and gender roles.


Well into prehistoric culture, men are believed to have assumed a variety of social and cultural roles which are likely similar across many groups of humans. In hunter-gatherer societies, men were often if not exclusively responsible for all large game killed, the capture and raising of most or all domesticated animals, the building of permanent shelters, the defense of villages, and other tasks where the male physique and strong spatial-cognition were most useful. Some anthropologists believe that it may have been men who led the Neolithic Revolution and became the first pre-historical ranchers, as a possible result of their intimate knowledge of animal life.

Throughout history, the roles of men have changed greatly. As societies have moved away from agriculture as a primary source of jobs, the emphasis on male physical ability has waned. Traditional gender roles for middle-class men typically involved jobs emphasizing moderate to hard manual labor (see Blue-collar worker), often with no hope for increase in wage or position. For poorer men among the working classes the need to support their families, especially during periods of industrial change and economic decline, forced them to stay in dangerous jobs working long arduous hours, often without retirement. Many industrialized countries have seen a shift to jobs which are less physically demanding, with a general reduction in the percentage of manual labor needed in the work force (see White-collar worker). The male goal in these circumstances is often of pursuing a quality education and securing a dependable, often office-environment, source of income. 

The Men's Movement is in part a struggle for the recognition of equality of opportunity with women, and for equal rights irrespective of gender, even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage. The difficulties of obtaining this recognition are due to the habits and customs recent history has produced. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement in recent decades, men in some societies now face women who receive educational and workplace benefit based solely on gender. Modern men in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as on the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and fatherhood - to name a few. Research has identified anti-male sexism, and the effects of its expansion may increase hardships for many males.

Charlie Strong (born August 2, 1960 in Batesville, Arkansas), is a college football coach currently serving as co-defensive coordinator, assistant head coach, and linebacker position coach of the Florida Gators.

After lettering for four years (1980-83) at University of Central Arkansas, Strong joined the Gator coaching staff after college as a graduate assistant in 1983.  His first full-time coaching job was at Southern Illinois in 1986, where he coached wide receivers.  He later assumed defensive coaching duties at Florida and Notre Dame.

In 1999 Strong joined the South Carolina Gamecocks as defensive coordinator, becoming the first African-American coordinator in Southeastern Conference history.  His stifling defenses and well-mannered personality created buzz that he would be possibly the first black head coach in the SEC, but job offers were slim (Sylvester Croom eventually broke the color barrier in the SEC coaching ranks).

Strong was hired as defensive coordinator for the Gators before the 2003 season.  When head coach Ron Zook took the University of Illinois coaching job with one game left in the 2004 season, Strong served as interim coach of the Gators for one game, the 2004 Peach Bowl, technically making him the second black head coach in SEC history.  Florida lost the game, 27-10, to the Miami Hurricanes.

Taxus sumatrana is an evergreen shrub and one of the eight species of the yew. It is found in a number of countries, including Afghanistan, Tibet, Nepal, Vietnam, India, Burma and China, and is known as the Chinese yew. It is typically found at heights ranging from 400-3100m in subtropical forest and on  highland ridges.  It can also be found conserved in the Taroko National Park in Taiwan and the Ayubia National Park in Pakistan.

Appearance.

The Taxus sumatrana is a wide trunked, bushy tree that grows to an average height of 14m. It's leaves are 1.2-2.7 cm long and 2-2.5 mm wide, and grow in two ranks along the branches, abruptly spiralling into an apex at the tip, with a pale yellow-green colour on top, and light green underneath. The Chinese yew has fleshy seeds that ripen into a red colour, and a grey-red bark which exfoliates in irregular 1.5 mm thick flakes and leaves scars on the trunk that appear yellow quickly after cutting.

Uses.

The oil used to mark a red spot on the forehead of a Brahmin is made by mixing oil with the bark from this tree. Chinese yews are also used for clogs, whip handles, bed frames and bows.

<doc id="3212105" title="Coastwatchers" nonfiltered="153" processed="151" dbindex="1480153">
 The Coastwatchers, also known as the Coast Watch Organisation, Combined Field Intelligence Service or Section "C" Allied Intelligence Bureau, were Allied military intelligence operatives stationed on remote Pacific island locations during World War II, to observe enemy movements and rescue stranded Allied personnel. They played a significant role in the Pacific Ocean theatre and South West Pacific theatre particularly as an early warning network for during the Battle of Guadalcanal. There were about 400 Coastwatchers in all   they were mostly Australian military officers, Pacific Islanders and escaped Allied prisoners of war.  The Coastwatchers were led by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was based in Townsville, Australia. Their actions were particularly important in montioring Japanese activity in the roughly thousand islands that make up the Solomon Islands.

Many personnel who took part in Coastwatcher operations behind enemy lines were commissioned as officers of the Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RANVR), to protect them in case of capture, although this was not always recognized by the Japanese military, which executed several.  The Coastwatchers' numbers were also augmented by escaped Allied personnel and even civilians. In one strange case, three German missionaries assisted the coastwatchers after escaping Japanese captivity. (Germany was an ally of Japan).

Feldt chose "Ferdinand" as the code name for his organisation, from a popular children's book about a bull, The Story of Ferdinand. He explained this by saying:

Ferdinand ... did not fight but sat under a tree and just smelled the flowers. It was meant as a reminder to Coastwatchers that it was not their duty to fight and so draw attention to themselves, but to sit circumspectly and unobtrusively, gathering information. Of course, like their titular prototype, they could fight if they were stung.;

In June 1942, "Ferdinand" became  part of the Allied Intelligence Bureau, which was under the South West Pacific Area (command) (SWPA). However Feldt reported to both GHQ, SWPA, in Brisbane and the Fleet Radio Unit in Melbourne (FRUMEL), which was under the Pacific Ocean Areas (command).

In 1942, two coastwatchers on Bougainville, Read and Mason, radioed early warning of Japanese warship and air movement (citing the numbers, type and speed of enemy units) to the United States Navy. Coastwatcher reports allowed U.S. forces to launch aircraft in time to engage the attackers. Admiral William Halsey, Jr. was later to say that the two men had saved Guadalcanal.

One of the most highly decorated coastwatchers was Sergeant Major Jacob C. Vouza who retired from the local constabulary in 1941, volunteered for coastwatcher duty, but was subsequently captured, tortured, then bayoneted and left to die. He survived and escaped to make contact with Marines warning them of an impending Japanese attack. He recovered from his wounds and continued to scout for the Marines. He was awarded the Silver Star and Legion of Merit by the United States and later received a knighthood as a Member of the British Empire.

In August 1943, LTJG John F. Kennedy of the United States Navy   a future President of the United States   and twelve fellow crew memebers were shipwrecked after the sinking of their boat, the PT-109. An Australian coastwatcher, Sub-Lt Arthur Reginald Evans, observed the explosion of the US Navy PT-109 when it was rammed by a Japanese destroyer. Despite US Navy crews giving up the crew as a complete loss, Evans dispatched two Solomon Islander scouts including Biuki Gasa in dugout canoes who found Kennedy and his surviving crew, who delivered a message inscribed on a coconut. Kennedy had scratched a message to Evans on the coconut describing the plight and position of his crew. The future U.S. President was rescued shortly after, and 20 years later welcomed Evans to the White House. Gasa did not make the trip for reasons that are unclear. 

Coastwatchers in popular culture.
Evans was depicted in the PT 109 and named in the Jimmy Dean hit song, also called "PT-109". In the 1964 film Father Goose, actor Cary Grant plays a coastwatcher. In the musical South Pacific, a US Marine is sent to do a similar job.

In W. E. B. Griffin's The Corps series, Griffin gives credit to Australian coastwatchers for their services at Guadalcanal.

Kirkdale TMD (code KK) is a Traction Maintenance Depot located beside Kirkdale railway station in north Liverpool, England. It is the largest depot on the Merseyrail network, located on the Northern Line and is used primarily for stabling units, carrying out minor repair works and cleaning units both outside and in.

History.
Originally known as Bank Hall sidings, the depot area was originally a large area of sidings with more than 30 roads. In the 1970s, when the new Link tunnel was being built to replace Liverpool Exchange, the sidings were transformed into a modern maintenance depot. A new shed with four roads was constructed, with wells underneath the tracks so that units could be inspected; each road is long enough to house two 3-car sets coupled together. Also constructed was a new carriage wash plant so that units could be driven through and cleaned within minutes; presently this is the only active washing plant on Merseyrail, the other at Birkenhead North TMD having been destroyed by consistent vandalism. With the depot's proximity to Kirkdale station, it was renamed upon the reopening.

Recent.
In 2006, a new wheel lathe is being constructed at the depot in an area formerly used for storage of departmental equipment. The new lathe will end the previous act of having train sets towed to Allerton TMD near Hunts Cross railway station by an 08 Shunter.

Allocation.
The Class 507 and Class 508 electric multiple units are based at Kirkdale depot, regularly stabled in the back sidings near Bank Hall railway station. In 2006, a new small shunter will be allocated to the depot to take sets into the new wheel lathe.

Previously, battery locomotives and Class 73 locos have been stored at the depot in the past for sandite duties in the winter.

 Disco Junkies .



The underground cartoon Disco Junkies was written and illustrated by Alex Fryer, and first appeared as a free black and white comic in the summer of 2005, distributed through the Internet and live music scene of Guildford. It initially took the form of graffiti style stickers and flyers, largely consisting of single illustrations and one pannel jokes. 

Several bars and clubs in the city, having commissioned illustrations, helped to popularise Alex's style of illustration, which carried the 'Disco Junkie' tag. Several indy bands used 'Disco Junkie' artwork in their flyers, the most notable being 'The Fake' and 'Jack Rabbit Agenda'. The 'Disco Junkie' label received indirect criticism from the Surrey Advertiser, after a sticker and flyer campaign involving artwork designed to look like parking tickets and currency, fell foul of a local councellor. Not long after this, Disco Junkies returned to being purely a comic, rather than a brand of localised flyer design.



Since the comics sketchy beginings, the stories were further developed, and a series of new characters added. While loosely based around The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the comic contained many drugs references, topical story lines, and borrowed themes from several schools of fantasy, science fiction and comedy. Many of the characters were anthropomorphic, and caracatured people in the media and politics.

Alex Fryer, was, at the time a Video Production student in Guildford. Though the future of the comic was never certain, several short illustration anthologies were printed in black and white and artwork still appears around the city from time to time.

Alex Fryer is also credited as an editor for this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx4dsmwzIEE

<doc id="1009988" title="Hi and Lois" nonfiltered="158" processed="156" dbindex="1480158">

Hi and Lois is a comic strip about a suburban family.  It debuted on October 18, 1954 and is distributed by King Features. 

Hiram ("Hi") and Lois Flagston are typical American suburbanites. They have four children: a stereotypically slovenly teen named Chip, rambunctious twins named Dot and Ditto, and a baby named Trixie, who loves talking to "sunbeam," a ray of sunlight.  They also have a large shaggy dog named Dawg. Their neighbors are the Thurstons, the fat and lazy "Thirsty" and his skinny wife Irma.

The Flagstons first appeared in Mort Walker's strip Beetle Bailey.  They spun off into their own strip, written by Walker and drawn by Dik Browne. Lois Flagston (née Bailey) is Beetle Bailey's sister, and the two strips make occasional crossovers. One of these occurred on the strip's 40th anniversary in 1994, when Beetle visited his sister Lois and her family.   

Today many consider Hi and Lois to be rather dated. The strip made efforts to keep up with the times, such as housewife Lois Flagston taking up a career in real estate in 1980. In previous decades the strip was acclaimed; in 1962 it earned Dik Browne a Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society.

The strip faced some controversy given the changes in morals since its debut in the 1950s. Once, editors insisted that belly buttons could not appear; in protest, Browne included a box of dimpled navel oranges.

The strip is now written by Brian and Greg Walker and drawn by Robert "Chance" Browne, the sons of the original creative team.

Hans Achim Litten (June 19, 1903   February 5, 1938) was a young lawyer, born in Halle, who had represented anti-Nazis at nearly all the important political trials after 1929. 

In May, 1931 he had even subjected Adolf Hitler to a two-hour cross examination in a case concerning two workers stabbed by stormtroopers. He was not forgotten, and, on the night of the Reichstag fire he was aroused from his bed, arrested, and sent without trial to Spandau Prison. From there he was moved, despite efforts by his mother to free him, to Sonnenberg concentration camp. From Sonnenberg he passed to the notorious Sachsenhausen, where his treatment was later described by an eyewitness to his mother.

He survived this ordeal only to be sent to the Dachau concentration camp, where he was reported to have hanged himself. His mother Irmgard Litten wrote a book about his ordeal titled in English, "Beyond Tears."

When East and West Germany were reunited, the lawyers association of Berlin chose to call itself the Hans Litten Bar Association. Every two years a lawyer is given the Hans Litten Prize by the German and European Democratic Lawyers Association. The Israeli lawyer Leah Tsemel and the American lawyer Michael Ratner, President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, have both received the Litten prize.

<doc id="3522545" title="Nana (rapper)" nonfiltered="162" processed="160" dbindex="1480162">

Nana Kwame Abrokwa
(born in 5 October 1968 in Accra, Ghana) is a German rapper and DJ, performing under the pseudonyms Nana or Darkman / Nana. Nana is not an actual first name, but a Ghanese title of nobility. His most important achievement came in the second half of the 1990's, when his style was characterized as "euro-rap" and his lyrics focused on the relationship with God, with his family, or on topics like racism and Holocaust.

 Biography .

Nana arrived in Hamburg with his mother and his brothers at the age of 10. At the beginning of the 90's, his debut consists of DJ-ing in hip-hop clubs. he also co-produces and raps in some songs of DJ David Fascher ("Here We Go", "Make The Crowd Go Wild"), under the alias MC Africa True.

In 1995 he joins as a rapper the Eurodance project Darkness, which was produced by Bülent Aris and Toni Cottura. The song "In My Dreams" becomes a club hit, but Nana didn't feel very comfortable with the style Darkness adopted and the group separates. However, his current scene name, Darkman, originates from this time.

In 1996 Aris and Cottura founded the Black Music label Booya Music, which Nana joined as the first artist. The first single, "Darkman" reached the German Top 10. The following one, "Lonely", became the most successful euro-rap song, being No. 1 for several weeks. The album, Nana, released in 1997, is more on the mainstream, US style of rapping. It features numerous other members of the Booya Family, such as Jan van der Toorn and Alex Prince.

The second album, Father, was released in May 1998 and contains rather slow pieces with very personal lyrics. The songs "Too Much Heaven" and "War" were also featured on the tribute albums Love The Bee Gees and Hands on Motown.

At the end of 1999, Nana's released the single "I Wanna Fly", which flopped, due to a decrease in euro-rap's popularity and the growing importance of hip-hop played in German. Nevertheless Nana still recorded two further albums with Booya Music, which were not released due to legal problems.

At the beginning of 2001 Nana released the German-language song Du wirst sehen, a gesture which was not appreciated by international fans. The single flopped, and the planned bilingual album Global Playa was canceled at the request of the record company.

After a long break, in the summer of 2004, Nana finally released the album All Doors In Flight No. 7, featuring Jan van der Toorn and Manuell, on his own label, Darkman Records. The album was distributed exclusively over the Internet, through Nana's website.

As of 2005, Nana is purportedly featured on a tape compilation of an underground DJ, Essenz Finezt (see Euro-rap.com).

<doc id="7860324" title="List of The Land Before Time characters" nonfiltered="163" processed="161" dbindex="1480163">
This article is about characters in the fictional Land Before Time universe.

Main Characters.
Littlefoot.

Littlefoot is an Apatosaurus but is called a longneck in the films. He is the central character of the film The Land Before Time and its sequels.

He is close friends to five other baby prehistoric animals (Cera, Ducky, Spike, Petrie, and Chomper). Littlefoot's having friends outside his species is a taboo, as many of the dinosaurs practice racial, or species based, segregation. His grandparents accept his friendships but other dinosaurs, such as Topsy (Cera's father), do not.

Littlefoot's primary caregiver is his grandparents, as his mother was killed in the original film, and his father, Bron, was separated from him and his mother shortly before Littlefoot's birth. Littlefoot later found his father in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration and met his foster brother, Shorty. Bron offered to let Littlefoot stay with him, but Littlefoot declined, staying with his friends and grandparents in the Great Valley.

Cera.

Cera is a Triceratops and a friend of Littlefoot.

Cera is a bossy dinosaur who tries to show no fear. She has no problem bragging about her accomplishments, but will run away at the first sign of any real danger. She is very sweet and caring, but that side of her personality is usually masked by her normally gruff exterior.

Cera's father Topsy, is seen in every film in the series, except The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists, but her mother was only seen in background shots of the original The Land Before Time. In The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses, Cera's dad was in love with his new girlfriend, Tria and had his name revealed. Cera has a brother and sister, who were seen briefly in The Land Before Time, and has a nephew and a niece, Dana and Dinah. Strangly, these two dino-toddlers have tiny bony stubs on there foreheads wich are clearly small horns. Cera, however, even though she is older then them, has yet to acquire horns on her head. Dinah and Dana made their appearances and were seen in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock.

In The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, her design was slightly modified to make her look older and more appealing. Her head and face is now less round and more angular, but her body design remains true to the original film.

Ducky.

Ducky is a Saurolophus, which is also called a "big mouth" or a "swimmer". She tends to say "Yep yep yep" quite a lot, which is frequently quoted today in popular culture and everyday life. Ducky's personality compared to the others is very caring and, at times, somewhat childish. Although she is sensitive to others' feelings, she can be easily manipulated to believe that some things may be right when in fact they might lead to trouble. This is shown in the first The Land Before Time movie when Cera convinced her that a certain route to the Great Valley was easier than the way up a mountain of loose rocks. This in fact lead to danger, as she and Spike ended up lost.

Petrie.

Petrie is a pterosaur, and is also called a flyer, (a Pteranodon to be exact).

Petrie has a family, which are a mom (voiced by Tress MacNeille) and a bunch of brothers and sisters. He was originally afraid of flying until a tangle with the Original Sharptooth gave him the courage (and breath) to save his friends. He used to idolize his Uncle Pterano, thinking he can do no wrong. Later he finds out that Pterano is as insecure as Petrie is. It is ironic how alike Pterano and Petrie are, not just in looks, but in personality. He seems to have a strong friendship with Ducky.

Spike.

Spike is, as his name implies, a 'spike-tail' (Stegosaurus).

He is one of the youngest members of the group, Chomper being the only major character younger than him. In fact, Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie witnessed his hatching and Ducky's mother adopted him upon reaching the Great Valley, as his family has yet to be seen. A Stegosaur family did, however, offer to take him with them, although he decided to stay with Ducky and his family. 

He is known for his large appetite and can often be seen chasing after some piece of food (a bush, leaves, exc.). He is also portrayed as mute, although later films, like The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire or The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses, show that he can speak perfectly well. He simply chooses not too.

Chomper.

Chomper is a Tyrannosaurus, which is known as a sharptooth in the Land Before Time movies. He is bilingual, being able to speak both the herbivore language of Littlefoot and his friends (heard as English to the viewer), and the "Sharptooth" language of Tyrannosaurus, which seems to consist of grunts, roars, and clicks. Littlefoot and his friends originally found Chomper as an egg and took care of him as surrogate parents until he was found by his real parents. He left the Great Valley with them and was not seen again until The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island, where he was living on an island with his parents. Now that the landbridge which connected the island to the mainland has been destroyed, he and his parents cannot get off the island. However, in the tv series, which appears to be after Land Before Time XI, he is shown still in the Great Valley, but without his parents.

Chomper is portrayed by Rob Paulsen in The Land Before Time II, Cannon Young in The Land Before Time V, and Max Burkholder in the TV series.

Ruby.

Ruby is a new friend of Littlefoot and his friends and appears in the television series. She is a female Oviraptor.

Parents, Foster Parents, Relatives and Adoptees.
Bron.
Bron is Littlefoot's father. He was separated from Littlefoot, his mother, and Grandpa and Grandma Longneck shortly before Littlefoot's birth. Until The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, Bron was unsure of his wife and son's fates. Bron also has an adopted son named Shorty.

In Part X, Littlefoot and his grandparents get a sudden urge to migrate to an unknown place, and when they arrive, they find hundreds of other longnecks. One of them was Bron, who recognizes Grandpa Longneck, and Littlefoot meets his father for the first time. Littlefoot didn't take this very well, however. He thought Bron had abandoned him and his mother, and he retreated into seclusion.  Bron caught up with him, and explains how they had gotten separated. Littlefoot accepts this and the two bond, much to the displeasure of Shorty, Littlefoot's foster brother. Shorty and Littlefoot made amends, however, when they were forced to work together to save themselves from attacking sharpteeth.it is unkown if Ali's Mother is his or his wife's sister.

Cera's Brothers and Sisters.
Chomper's Parents.
They only appeared in The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure and The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island. They are both green in color, but the mother and father are distinguished by exact shade, with the father being much darker (this may reflect a gender or racial difference). Although they are ferocious predators like the other sharpteeth, they are also devoted parents. It is suggested in the series that they hired Ruby as some sort of babysitter for Chomper. Both Ruby and Chomper were separated from their family by Redclaw and his minions, and so far they have yet to reunite.

Dinah and Dana.
Dinah and Dana are little Triceratops twins. They are Cera's niece and nephew. They first appeared in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock and have not been seen since the further sequels.

Ducky and Spike's father.
he is rarly seen but has apeared when at the nest or in the back ground like in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze.but he still lives.

Ducky and Spike's Mother.
Ducky and Spike's mother is a Saurolophus and has appeared in most of the 11 movies that have debuted so far. More than Littlefoot's mother was, she is blind to race as seen in her inter-racial/species adoption of Spike, a Stegosaurus. She loves all her children (Ducky and Spike have other nestmates) and is very attentive. She is popular among Littlefoot and his friends for these reasons and is treated with respect both by Littlefoot and his friends as well as the adults in the Great Valley. She occasionally has doubts on how to raise Spike, whether in keeping with her own values or with spike-tail customs. This was seen in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze when a Stegosaur herd met and befriended Spike. She even let him go with the herd to learn "his kind's" ways; however when Spike fell through ice it was she who rescued her grateful son.

This is also scientifically accurate as at least some Hadrosaurids such as Maiasaura, or "good mother lizard," are believed to have been attentive parents. Curiously, her son is shown as being able to walk and even talk soon after hatching unlike other young dinosaurs in the film while the evidence for hadrosaur parental care rests in the fact that young were unable to care for themselves.

Ducky and Spike's Brothers and Sisters.
ther are at least 14 of ther brothers and sisters.

Grandpa and Grandma Longneck.
Grandpa and Grandma Longneck are Littlefoot's grandparents and his primary caregivers after his mother died. They act as parents to Littlefoot, giving him advice when needed and take their responsibility of protecting Littlefoot very seriously. (When, in Part VI, Littlefoot called Doc the greatest, his grandfather was visibly hurt.) Their real names have yet to be revealed, as most everyone calls them Grandpa and Grandma. Topsy calls Littlefoot's grandfather "Longneck" and Bron, Littlefoot's father, calls him "Poppa Longneck."

They also provide a voice of reason in the Great Valley, trying to make peace between the dinosaurs when times become hard. Detailed analysis of the film series shows that Littlefoot's grandfather has assumed a leadership position among the dinosaurs of the Valley, welcoming visitors and newcomers (The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists and The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock), passing judgement on criminals (The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire), deciding a course of action for the herds of the Valley (The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island) managing natural resources such as water (The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island), and providing for the common defense in times of danger (The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure).

Grandpa Longneck is also shown to be a very loving husband to his wife (a song from part IV indicates that marriage does exist in the Land Before Time universe) and a kindly grandfather-figure not only to Littlefoot but to all the young dinosaurs of the Valley. He in fact, has been known to tell children stories around the campfire--or lavapool. It can also be assumed that he was good father to his late daughter, Littlefoot's mother. He also gets along well with Bron his son-in-law. However, while is mostly free of the bigotry that characterizes some other dinosaurs, he has a prejudiced view of sharptooth dinosaurs. He sees them as "not very bright"; however, with how one killed his daughter, it is a a less severe condemnation than that of his son-in-law who despises them as cowards.

As seen in Part V, after being separated from Littlefoot, his grandparents gave up hope of ever seeing either him of their daughter again and went searching for the Valley. On the way, they met other dinosaurs who joined their search for the Valley as well, not unlike how their children also found and joined each other. It is likely at this time that he was formally introduced to Topsy and assumed the leadership of the combined herds. As of the moment, Grandpa and Grandma Longneck live happily in the Great Valley, though they occasionally meet with relatives as in the Part IV or leave to meet with other longnecks as in Part X.

Grandpa Longneck has been shown to be rather undecided in his beliefs. (This is quite unlike his daughter who stated that "somethings  you see with your heart" and whose ghost in the first films shows that the supernatural does indeed exist.) In The Secret of Saurus Rock he tells the children legends of heroic dinosaurs and of the mystical Saurus Rock that protects the Valley but when asked which of the stories are really true, he doesn't know. However, during The Great Longneck Migration he just knows that he must go and that he must re-enact the longneck creation myth.

Grandpa and Grandma Longneck have appeared in all The Land Before Time films.

Littlefoot's Mother.
Appearing only in the original The Land Before Time, Littlefoot's mother was shown a very loving mother to her only son. (However, as the broken eggs in her nest show, it is more precise to say that Littlefoot was her only surviving son.) She got along well with her parents and loved her husband Bron very much, naming their son after him. ("Littlefoot" was Bron's nickname as a child.) She also led the herd in search of the Great Valley. At the time of her son's birth, the land was suffering geologic and ecologic upheavels that included but were limited to, drought, flooding, famine, predation, and earthquake. Determined that her son not grow up in such an environment, she led her herd in search of the Great Valley "a wonderful, beautiful place" with green food, "more than you could ever eat, and with more fresh, cool water than you could ever drink." She had no proof that the Great Valley even existed but she was guided by her knowledge that "somethings, you see with your heart."

she woke up and saw her son was gone. She heard his and cera's scream's and arived just in time.how ever after a huge battle having the sharptooth jump on her back and bite into her and being bashed agenst a rock she thought she had achieved victorie but she had to save the children once more finally pushing the sharptooth down the ledge.Unfortunately,her atempt left her to die. With her last breath, she told her son to search for the Great Valley and that she would be with him. Her ghost would appear to her son in times of need and aid him in the quest for the Great Valley. Her last appearance was at the end of the first film when Littlefoot despaired of ever finding the Great Valley and she or her ghost took to the form of a longneck cloud to guide him into the Great Valley where on a beam of light came from her heart. The light shone on Littlefoot and spread to illuminate the Great Valley below.

Though long since dead, she is periodically mentioned through the film series and she may have made an appearance in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island. Littlefoot remembers his mother and looks at a star shining brighter than the others. She also made an appearance in a flashback in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration.

From her portryal and her family's memories of her, she appears to have been a good person, though she was not quite as enlightened as her son. She acquiesced to species segregation, not because she necessarily liked it but because "it's always been that way." Like human parents who, in real life, seek to raise their children in racially homogenous Sundown towns, part of the reason that Littlefoot's mother sought to raise him in the Valley was because "there will be many, many longnecks for you to play with." However, the fact that she saved both Littlefoot and  Cera and from Sharptooth shows that she was willing to abandon racial taboos. Her true name is unknown. She is often just called Littlefoot's Mother and sometimes Mama Longneck. She is likely Grandpa and Grandma Longneck's daughter as how her husband refers to the old one as Poppa Longneck instead of father.it is unkown if Ali's Mother is her or bron's
sister.

Petrie's Mother.
She is shown to have a big heart like her son. She still loves her brother, Pterano, even if he did all of those terrible things.

Petrie's Brothers and Sisters.
They had brief appearances in The Land Before Time, The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island, and The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire. They have a bigger part in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

They are voiced by Jeff Bennett (who voices Petrie), Nika Futterman, and Susan Blu.

Pterano.
He is Petrie's maternal uncle. While idolized by his nephew he is not trusted by his sister (Petrie's mother), nor by Grandpa Longneck and Topsy. That is seen in how after the combined herds joined under Grandpa Longneck in search of the Great Valley, Pterano promised them an easy way to the Valley and, due to his incompetent leadership, blundered them into a sharptooth ambush (they were never heard from again). After reuniting with his sister in the Great Valley, he, along with his henchmen Rinkus (a pink flyer) and Sierra (a brown flyer), began searching for the Stone of Cold Fire, a comet which he thinks will grant him magic power. He fails and winds up putting Petrie and the other children in danger, but saves them at the end. For that, Grandpa Longneck exiles Pterano for a  period of 5 cold times (winters/years).

Pterano appears in The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire and has not been seen since. It was rumoured he would appear in the upcoming The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers but  Michael York (who provided Pterano's voice) has confirmed that he isn't appearing.

Shorty.
A dark green Brachiosaurus, he appeared in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration. In Bron's backstory, he was found wandering in the wilderness with eight or so orange Brachiosaurus hatchlings. Since he was the eldest of the small herd, he is shown in the flashback to be very protective of the hatchlings. Shorty, along with the hatchlings, followed Bron.

In the crater, Shorty and Littlefoot didn't get along well until near the end of the movie, when Littlefoot stopped him from leaving the crater by himself.  Littlefoot proposed the two could be brothers, which made Shorty happier and less jealous of Littlefoot. In the end, he gets on well with Littlefoot's friends and Bron finally adopts him after Littlefoot tells Bron to take care of Shorty.

Shorty is the young bully of the film, since he had a nasty past and was the only one from that small herd that wasn't adopted (until the end of the film).  He was antisocial, mostly wandering by himself and picking on other young dinosaurs, including Littlefoot. His name is ironic in that "Shorty" is a playground insult, but he is also shorter than Littlefoot even though he is clearly older than him.

Topsy.
Topsy is a Triceratops, the father of Cera. For many films, his true name was unknown and was credited as "Daddy Topps" in the first film and "Cera's Dad" in the first ten sequels to the film. There has been some argument over whether or not Topsy is his real name and not a petname given him by Tria. This is seen in how Cera was visibly angered when Ducky called him that. Even so, it is assumed that Topsy is indeed his real name.

His personality was unknown in the first film but he was shown to be guilty of racism, or speciesism, growling at Littlefoot (whom he sees as a bad influence on Cera) and telling him that "Threehorns never play with longnecks." He was often portrayed as pompous, self-rightous, and bigoted; the degree of his pride and stubbornness was seen in The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving when he took Cera straight into a forest fire rather than go with the other dinosaurs. He is aware of his bad attitude but, in the beginning at least, he thought nothing of it saying that even if was thought mean, he had a family to protect and he would do that by any means necessary. In a song from The Time of the Great Giving he says that was inculcated with this attitude by his own father, who told him to "stand and fight, don't run away." In recent films, he has still been shown as stern and less understanding than Grandpa Longneck, but his prejudice and bad attitude have drastically (but gradually) lessened through the many sequels.

There is also the question of where Topsy's wife/mate is - indeed, the last film The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses, shows him happily seeing Tria; Littlefoot was shown asking if she would be Cera's new mother. Topsy's mate was shown near the start of  The Land Before Time as were their other children. However, when he and Cera were reunited at the end of the film, some of the other children were gone, his wife as well as the other featured children disappearing afterwards as the result of an accidental retcon. Given the fatalistic attitude of the first film (the narrator stated that "Sharpteeth stalked the herds waiting to seize any who strayed") it is likely they died on the way to the Great Valley. However, as seen by the presence of Topsy's grandchildren, Dinah and Dana, in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock, at least one of his children, unnamed and likely from before Cera's egg-laying, is alive. After Invasion of the Tinysauruses, Topsy and Tria have another daughter, Tricia.

In recent films, he has been shown to be part of the Great Valley's leadership, sharing power with Littlefoot's grandfather. Though Topsy and Littlefoot's family met early in the first film, it is assumed that he and Grandpa Longneck were formally introduced to each other and decided to assume shared leadership of the combined herds after they were separated from their children in the great earthquake. This was shown in a flashback in The Stone of Cold Fire.

Topsy is portrayed by Burke Byrnes in The Land Before Time and John Ingle in all of the sequels, except The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists, where he never made an appearance.

Tria.
Tria is a pink "Three Horn" (Triceratops). She is kind, loving and brave, though her character may seem rather false and unconvincing at first. It is revealed in The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses that she and Topsy (Cera's dad) met when they were younger, and are reunited in the film, much to the dismay of Cera. Despite some false starts, however, Tria and her new stepdaughter do manage to get along in the end. Unlike Topsy, Tria immediately finds the Tinysauruses cute when she comes across a wandering pair, which is why she separates from him for a short time. Tria and Topsy have a child in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

She is portrayed by Camryn Manheim in the sequels and Jessica Gee-George in the TV series.

Tricia.
Tricia is a young light-pink Triceratops. She is the daughter of Tria and Topsy and the half-sister of Cera. Her first appearance is in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

Minor Characters.
Ali.
Ali is an apatosaurus who bears a striking resemblance to Littlefoot apart from her dark pink skin colour and light blue eyes.  She and her mother belong to a herd that was forced to leave their homeland due to flooding and excess rain. (This was likely the same changing of the Land that was referred to in the first film.) With their old home turned from the Valley of Mists into the Land of Mists, Ali's herd, led by the matriarch called the Old One, was forced to leave.

During Migration, Ali's herd found the Great Valley and were welcomed by their "cousins," Grandpa Longneck's herd. However, Grandpa Longneck fell ill and Ali and Littlefoot left the Great Valley to search Ali's old home for the fabled Night Flower that would heal Littlefoot's ailing grandfather. Cera, Ducky, Petrie, and Spike soon followed them, and met up with Littlefoot and Ali. Together, the group found the Night Flowers and brought them to the Great Valley to heal Grandpa Longneck. Afterwards, Ali and her herd left the Valley to continue their migration even though she and Littlefoot would one day meet again. However, the narrator assures us that that is another story. So far, this statement has been ironic; she has not appeared since in the further sequels.

Like most dinosaurs outside of the Great Valley herd, Ali was wary of trusting dinosaurs outside of her species and, on her part, Cera initially didn't trust Ali, but later learned to accept her and the two became friends. Fanfiction often has Littlefoot and Ali fall in love and marry as adults. She appeared in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.

In The Land Before Time TV series, Ali returns with the herd.  She meets a new friend, Red when her herd and another met and joined together.

Ali's Mother.
Archie.
Archie was an old Archelon and appeared in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.  He may have been inspired by Crusty the Turtle, a character who appeared on a 1989 animated series very similar to The Land Before Time called Dink, the Little Dinosaur.  Both characters were shown to live in caves and give advice to the main character, an Apatosaurus (Littlefoot/Dink), and his multi-species group of friends, including a Pteranadon (Petrie/Flapper) and a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur (Ducky/Amber and Scat).

Big Daddy.
The leader of the Tinysauruses, he is not only the voice of authority, but he is over-protective and thinks he is the biggest out of the Tinysaurus herd. He has been met with much derision from his daughters.

Chatter.
Doc.
Doc is a wandering Diplodocus (longneck) who goes "where the road takes him." He is shown to be very taciturn and not forthcoming in his past. Also, The Dinosaur Filmography describes his voice as being as gravelly as a bone bed.

Shortly after appearing in the Great Valley, he saved Littlefoot who quickly went on to idolize the wanderer. Littlefoot believed Doc to be legendary "Lone Dinosaur" who saved the Great Valley long ago from the most terrible sharptooth. He bases these assumptions on the fact that Doc can do fancy tricks with his tail, he's been to the Great Valley before, he has a scar on his eye and he has a resemblance to Saurus Rock. To a degree, Littlefoot places him above his own grandfather and defends him, Doc, when he is accused of bringing bad luck to the Valley. Towards the end, Doc and Grandpa Longneck work together to save Littlefoot from an Allosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus; Littlefoot asks Doc to stay in case the Valley should ever need a hero but Doc replies that the Valley already has a hero and looks towards Grandpa Longneck.

Doc appears in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock. Prior to The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, some fans asked if Doc was in fact, Littlefoot's father.

Elsie.
Elsie is a kind plesiosaurus that Littlefoot and friends met in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island.  

After trying to find food for the dislocated members of the Great Valley to keep the group together, Littlefoot and the others get marooned on an island, where the vast ocean surronding it prevents the homesick Littlefoot and gang from leaving, for they had a fear of 'swimming sharpteeth'. Their problem is eventually solved when Elsie appears, offering the kids a ride to the mainland.  They accept, and they travel safely back to the other members of the Great Valley, who have found enough food to last them until they could finally return to the Great Valley.

Guido.
Guido is a Microraptor who appears in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.  Although rumoured to be multicoloured, his feathers are, in actuality, presented in warm shades of green and yellow, mostly Jade, and he has never seen another creature like himself.  He is more of a comic relief character than previous guest characters, and he is voiced by Rob Paulsen.

Hyp.
The leader of the trio of bullying dinosaurs in The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving, who tried to cause trouble for Littlefoot and his friends. Hyp, along with his other friends Mutt and Nod, has a bad attitude on the outside but he often hides his cowardliness to make him look braver, or "bigger". Eventually, Hyp and his friends lighten up and help Littlefoot and his friends with helping their parents deal with a pack of Sharpteeth, and later some food to share with others. The trio has not appeared since in the further sequels.

Hyp's Father.
An often grumpy dinosaur, he yells at his son when he's concerned for his safety. Like his son, his attitude may have an effect on others, including Topsy, who realises the errors of his ways on raising his daughter, Cera, after witnessing Hyp's father telling off his son with the exact same words Topsy used with Cera ("I'm your father, and I know what's best for you!"). Hyp's father is not cowardly but he is not always angry; he can also be kind to others, as shown at the end of the film. In V he can be seen when the dinosaurs are leaving the valley but he is blue.

Lizzie.
Lizzie was one of the Tinysauruses Littlefoot and friends met in Invasion of the Tinysauruses.  A daughter of Big Daddy, she was fed up with her father's over-protectiveness and distrust of Littlefoot and his friends, similar to Cera's situation with her father, Topsy. Lizzie and Cera quickly became friends and made amends with their fathers. Voiced by Cree Summer.

Mo.
Mo is a colourful Ophthalmosaurus who first made his debut appearance in The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water. He is incredibly playful, especially with his "mud brother", Littlefoot, but his boisterous antics could try the patience of some, including Cera. He is bilingual in that he can speak both Littlefoot's herbivore and his native dolphin-like languages, which the  dinosaurs don't understand (Mo tried to warn them about an approaching Liopleurodon, which the dinosaurs found funny rather than cautious).

So far, he is the only character to appear as a notable cameo in the latest sequels. In The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, he is seen jumping out of the water during the "Adventuring" musical number. He can also be seen during the "Flip, Flap and Fly" music video for the upcoming The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

Mutt.
One of the bullying trio, he is dim-witted and more dependent on his friends. Because he is not so bright, he is more of a coward than Hyp or Nod. He is a Muttaburrasaurus and his name is inspired by his Latin species name.

Mutt's Father.
He can be seen briefly in the fight against the raptors and in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze saying that after Topsy slipped from his nest he slammed into his nose.

Nod.
Another of Hyp's friends, a Nodosaurus.

Old One.
She is the leader of the migrating Apatosaurus in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists. She is regarded by her herd as the wisest, although some find her claims hard to believe (Littlefoot questions her views on whether retrieving the Night Flower from the Land of Mists is too dangerous, for example).

Pat.
An old but not always wise Apatosaurus, he offered to look after Littlefoot's friends on their way to the crater in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration. When they realise they cannot make the journey by themselves, Pat finally looks after them. His leg was severely burned from erupting lava after telling the longneck creation myth to the gang, but they help Pat escape from possibly dying by helping him get up. When they arrive at the crater, he helps defend the other children against three sharpteeth. At the end of the movie, the children ask him to come with them to the Great Valley, which he slowly accepts.

Pat is shown to be a lonely traveller, as he offers twice to look after Littlefoot's friends, takes a different route to the crater and does not travel with a sauropod herd. He is gentle but because of his age he is physically weak. He was voiced by James Garner and has not appeared since in the further sequels.

Rainbow Faces.

Red.

Red is a Apatosaurus who resembles Littlefoot, and has large eyes.  He was introduced in The Land Before Time TV series, when Ali shows up in The Great Valley.  At first, Red boasts about himself and told Ali stories about him protecting his herd, and convinced her that they were real.  Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike, Petrie, Chomper, and Ruby plan a scheme to convince Ali that Red has been making up all of the stories when Chomper acts as a mean Sharptooth, and scares him away.  After, Red admits to making up the stories when the Old One finds out.  He then becomes friends with the gang.

Rooter.
Rooter was an old armored dinosaur. He made only one appearance in the original The Land Before Time but was one of the more powerful characters from that film and his actions are still felt today. After Littlefoot was orphaned, he was wandering and came across the taciturn and almost disagreeable Rooter. He angrily told Littlefoot to stop crying but stopped when he learned that Littlefoot's mother was dead. He said, "Now you pay attention to old Rooter." and told the young dinosaur that the Great Circle of Life had begun but not everyone made it back together at the end. Counseling Littlefoot through his grief, he said that he'd always miss his mother but that she would always be with him as long as he remembered the things she'd taught him. "In a way, you'll never be apart for you are still a part of each other." When Littlefoot said that his stomach hurt, Rooter said "That too will go in time little fella... only in time."

Rooter was added to the film to help soften the emotional blow from the intense Sharptooth attack and the scene depicting the death of Littlefoot's mother. Though it was Rooter's only appearance, Bron would later remember somebody telling him of what happened to his mother. Some mistake the dinosaur he mentioned to be Rooter, but Bron also mentioned he heard no word about Littlefoot from this dinosaur. Rooter's voice actor was also the narrator of the first film, Pat Hingle.

Rocky and Dusty.
Skitter.
Sue.
A bright pink Supersaurus, she saved Littlefoot from a crocodile by simply crushing its face in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration. She wishes for a mate and once in the crater, she finally finds an Ultrasaurus, a sauropod taller than herself. Sue is kind and gentle, but her real personality remains a mystery because of her short amount of screen time. She was voiced by Bernadette Peters.

Mr. Thicknose.
Mr. Thicknose, a Pachyrhinosaurus, is, or was, a very respected individual in the Great Valley community and served as a teacher to the children of the Valley. However, his pedagogy was that of being a "know-it-all." The adults of the Valley would send him their children to receive a primary education; they assumed that Mr. Thicknose was indeed a polymath and could effectivily instruct their children.

However, this changed during the Big Freeze. When Littlefoot proved that he saw snow; when this happened, Mr. Thicknose was verbally attacked by the grownups for not warning them so they could store away their food before the snow got heavier. Broken hearted, he walks away to near the pass to sit down and sulk; he apparently sits for some time, judging by the snow on him. He then accompanies Littlefoot and the others to the Mysterious Beyond where they have an accounter with a "sharp-tooth" and find a hot spring, with much food. There, they discover the truth that Mr. Thicknose has never been to the Mysterious Beyond before, and his knowldege comes not from primary sources (that is, his own research) but rather from secondary sources (stories from far walkers or migrating herds. This should not diminish his position as a teacher, however. Some of the best professors use secondary sources).

Though he does remain in the Great Valley, he has not been since the Big Freeze. It is not known whether or not he resumed his teaching position.

He appeared in the film The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze and has been seen in the Land Before Time (TV series)|The Land Before Time TV series].

His name reflects his species name which means "thick nose lizard" or "thick nose reptile." Other dinosaurs have been known to have species names as surnames or family names such as Mr. Clubtail. Curiously, with how Topsy and Grandpa Longneck call each other longneck and three-horn, this could mean that the two leaders of the Great Valley combined herds also have their species names as surnames as well. (Hence, Mr. Topsy Three-horn.)

Tickles.
The mouselike Tickles is the first mammal seen in The Land Before Time film series. Sentient but mute, he is of unknown species (presumably a Megazostrodon, but may be unlikely) and was named because he, in Ducky's words, had "tickly fuzzies all over him." He appears in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.

Tinysauruses.
The Tinysauruses are a small herd of kitten-sized, multicolored sauropods that made their debut in The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses. Their name is a portmanteau of "tiny" and "-sauruses". Unlike their slower relatives, they are quite fast and are very lightweight, and their small size is useful for crawling into small spaces. In the film, Littlefoot accuses the Tinysauruses for knocking down and stealing tree-sweets from the tree-sweet tree. Because of this, the other dinosaurs are eventually fearful of these rather alien creatures, and have a desire to kill them if they could. When Littlefoot befriends these creatures, however, they turn out to be more sentient than he imagined.

Tippy.
A pink Stegosaurus, he is Spike's playful companion during the stegosaur migration in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze. When a stegosaur herd moved into the Great Valley, Spike immediately became close friends with Tippy. Unlike Spike, Tippy is very vocal; his catchphrase is "Fun, fun, fun!". He was voiced by Jeremy Suarez, who later did the voice of Koda in Brother Bear. Tippy has not appeared since.

Tippy's Mother.
Villains.
Ichy and Dil.
Ichy and Dil were an Ichthyornis and a crocodile, perhaps a Deinosuchus respectively. Though they thouroughly disliked each other ("I need you like I need a disease!" "Oh yeah, well I need you like the sun needs to freeze!"), they made a working partnership in which small but "eagle-eyed" Ichy would spot prey and near sighted but very big Dill would move in for the kill. They were first stalking prey in a large cave until they came across Littlefoot and his friends. They then followed them to Ali's old home, now the Valley of Mists and there in the rivers and waterways almost ate them before Dil was chased off by an angry plesiosaur. Ichy was sent flying by a tree branch.

They appeared in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.

Ozzy and Strut.
Ozzy and Strut are two Struthiomimus brothers who entered the Great Valley in hopes of stealing eggs, though the more relaxed Strut had hoped to eat plants. They were bumbling villains who wound up being chased out of the Great Valley by Chomper's vengeful parents.

Their first appearance was in The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure. However, that was not the first appearance of a Struthiomimus, or egg stealers as they are called. The first was in the original The Land Before Time where one tried to steal Littlefoot as an egg. Also, during that film's end credits, a Struthiomimus, or egg stealer is shown creeping into the Valley. This may or may not be Ozzy.

Redclaw.
Redclaw is a male Tyrannosaurus who has a distinctive scar that that goes through his left eye. He is the prominent antagonist in the TV series.

Rinkus and Sierra.
Appearing only in The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire, they are originally friends of Pterano, but appear more sinister then their associate, particularly Sierra. They assist in the kidnapping of Ducky and attempt a treason on Pterano. It was believed that they were burned at the end of The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire. The Internet Movie Database mistakes Sierra to be in The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water. Rinkus and Sierra were once announced to appear in the upcoming film The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers, but this decision was apparently dropped.

Rinkus was voiced by Rob Paulsen (who also voiced Spike, Chomper, Mo, and Guido) and Sierra was voiced by Jim Cummings.

Screech.
Screech is one of the two Velociraptor companions of Redclaw.

Sharptooth.


Sharpteeth are carnivorous dinosaurs, that are the film series' main antagonists. Each film typically brings in a new sharptooth or two, usually involving a conflict between either the two sharpteeth or the sharpteeth and the dinosaurs living in the Great Valley at the climax of the film. 

Sharpteeth live in the area known as the 'Mysterious Beyond', the land outside of the Great Valley. The Great Valley is surrounded by great mountains, preventing sharpteeth from entering. However, in the event of a landslide, as in The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, sharpteeth find a way in.

The characters have a one-sided view of sharpteeth (save for Chomper, who is a sharptooth himself), some going as far as calling them unintelligent and dangerous. Throughout the series, however, some sharpteeth have proven to be kind. Chomper and his parents showed kindness to Littlefoot and his friends in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island (although Chomper's parents needed some persuasion).

Swimming Sharptooth.
In some of the films in which water was prominently featured, most notably The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island, The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water and The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers, swimming carnivores such as Liopleurodon and sharks are called swimming sharpteeth.

Mo and Elsie are examples of creatures deemed "swimming sharpteeth", although the two of them are harmless, even helping Littlefoot and his friends.

Jacob Warrick (1773 - 1811) was an Indiana militia leader.

Jacob Warrick was born in 1773, Warrick's Station, in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. Jacob was the son of John Warrick, who fought at the Battle of Point Pleasant, in Lord Dunmore's War in 1774. Jacob Warrick moved on to Nicholas County, Kentucky.

In 1795, Warrick married Jane Montgomery, in Virginia. She was the daughter of Thomas Montgomery, who settled in Montgomery County, Kentucky in 1793.

The Montgomery family arrived in Gibson County, Indiana, in 1805, and the Warricks arrived in 1806. Warrick, together with Thomas Montgomery, burned the last Native American village in Gibson County in 1807, and pursued the Natives into Illinois.

Capt. Jacob Warrick commanded a company in the Indiana militia during Tecumseh's War. He was killed on November 7, 1811, at the Battle of Tippecanoe.

Jane Montgomery died in 1846, in Gibson County, Indiana.

<doc id="5210426" title="Moody's Mood for Love" nonfiltered="165" processed="163" dbindex="1480165">
"Moody's Mood for Love" is jazz saxophonist James Moody's instrumental solo on the song "I'm in the Mood for Love." Later, jazz singer Eddie Jefferson wrote lyrics to this improvisation by Moody. This particular arrangement of the song did not come to be known by its now common title of "Moody's Mood for Love" until King Pleasure released a very popular vocal version in 1952. King Pleasure's version included vocals by Blossom Dearie as well as instrumental contributions from Teacho and Band. Other artists who later released renditions of the song include George Benson, Aretha Franklin, Queen Latifah, Quincy Jones, Tito Puente, Amy Winehouse and Georgie Fame.  In 2006, American Idol contestant Elliott Yamin remade the song. His version appears on the album American Idol Season 5: Encores. This version just missed the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The TONY award-winning musical Jersey Boys featured the song. The song also has been featured on an episode of The Cosby Show. 

The lyrics are often incorrectly attributed to King Pleasure because he was the first to record it. However, some sources report that when Pleasure was asked to write more lyrics to solos he confessed that he had not written this one. He had heard Jefferson perform it in a jazz club some years before and asked permission to reproduce it. James Moody later hired Jefferson to come on the road with him. Jefferson also appears on several recordings with Moody.

Another repercussion of Jefferson s lyrical marriage to Moody s solo was the impacted it had on jazz singer Jon Hendricks. The story goes that Hendricks was sitting in a café when the King Pleasure recording of Moody s Mood came on the jukebox. According to Hendricks, he had been writing  unpopular  songs for some time, but when he heard the recording and realized that it was a saxophone solo with words he decided to change his approach to songwriting.  I didn t have to stop at 32 bars. Now I could write lyrics for all the parts in the orchestra.  He went on to collaborate with singer/arranger, Dave Lambert, and singer, Annie Ross, to form the group Lambert, Hendricks & Ross LHR. The group multi-tracked their voices and recorded the album  Sing a Song of Basie  in which they sang lyrics be Hendricks to the full arrangements of the Count Basie Orchestra (Ross singing all the trumpet parts, Hendricks singing the saxophone parts and Lambert singing the trombone parts). With the exception of a small rhythm section all 13 horn parts were reproduced by the three voices dubbed over.

<doc id="1873207" title="Windows XP 64-bit Edition" nonfiltered="166" processed="164" dbindex="1480166">





Microsoft Windows XP 64-bit Edition was a version of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system designed to run on Intel Itanium family of microprocessors in their native IA-64 mode. It should not be confused with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, which is designed for x86-64 processors.

Two major versions of Windows 64-bit Edition were released:
 Windows XP 64-bit Edition for Itanium systems, Version 2002   Based on Windows XP codebase, which was released in 2001;
 Windows XP 64-bit Edition, Version 2003   Based on Windows Server 2003 codebase, which added support for the Itanium 2 processor, was released on March 28, 2003. ;

Windows XP 64-bit didn't fall into one of Microsoft's then current Windows XP product lines ('Home', 'Professional', 'Media Center' or 'Tablet') but was a separate edition made solely for the Itanium processor and its 64-bit instructions. However it was mostly analogous to Windows XP Professional Edition, but with some limitations:

 Initially it lacked most media applications such as Windows Media Player, NetMeeting, Windows Movie Maker, and integrated CD burning, although WMP and NetMeeting were added in the 2003 version.
 Numerous old technologies such as DAO, Jet database and most notably NTVDM were removed, so support for MS-DOS, POSIX, OS/2, and Win16 applications is absent.

However, unlike previous alternate architecture ports of Windows (Windows NT 4.0 for PowerPC, MIPS R4x00, and Alpha) Windows XP 64-bit Edition could run standard x86 32-bit applications through its WOW64 (Windows on Windows) emulation layer. While the original Itanium processor contained an on-chip IA-32 decoder, it was deemed far too slow for serious use (Running at about 400MHz), so Microsoft and Intel wrote a software 32 to 64 bit translator dubbed the IA-32 Execution Layer. It allowed real time translation of x86 32-bit instructions into IA-64 instructions, allowing legacy 32-bit applications to run (albeit significantly more slowly than native code). 

Criticism.

Windows XP 64-bit Edition could not use 32-bit drivers and services (except for codecs such as XviD, which were actually 32-bit DLLs so they could be used if media players are 32-bit). Thus, many (older) devices are incompatible with this version of Windows. 

Security updates were discontinued for Windows XP 64-bit Edition because of the more recent release Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.  Many fans of old DOS games have been reluctant to install 64-bit edition since the 64-bit edition lacks support for DOS applications.

As of December 2005, there were 482 hotels and resorts operating under the brand.

During America's Bicentential in 1976, Marriott opened two identical amusement parks in Santa Clara, California and Gurnee, Illinois.  The California park is now owned by Paramount Parks.  The Illinois park is now owned by Six Flags.  There are some obvious visuals still remaining at both parks regarding their days as Marriott parks.  The original theme was American patriotism.  The imagery of "Old Glory" and other American icons still are displayed in some architecture.  Both parks boast one double-decker merry-go-round each.  The California park dismantled its "Triple Wheel" ferris wheel.  

In September 2005, Marriot Hotels & Resorts unveiled its first new room designs in ten years. Dubbed mSpot, the new rooms feature clean lines and updated technology, and are intended to be younger, urban and more hip than they had been previously.

Barbier is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It forms a matched pair with Cyrano crater to the north-northwest, and it lies to the southeast of the huge Garagin walled-plain. Southwest of Barbier crater is Sierpinski crater, and to the southeast is the Mare Ingenii.

The outer rim of Barbier crater has been eroded somewhat by subsequent impacts, particularly at the north end where the wall has been degraded by several small craterlets. A small crater lies across the eastern rim, and the southern rim is wider and irregular in shape. A small crater lies near where a central peak would be located, offset slightly to the east of the mid-point.

Satellite craters.
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Barbier crater.

inspirations for a new generation of music, rock and roll.]]

Willie Dixon (July 1, 1915   January 29, 1992) was a well-known American blues bassist, singer, songwriter, and record producer.

Career.
He was born as William James Dixon, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was a producer for Chess and Checker Records in Chicago and is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues.  He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Led Zeppelin, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, and others.

He had a colourful life.  In his teens he had many scrapes with the law, and decided to hitchhike his way to Chicago.  A giant of a man, he took up boxing, and was so successful as to win the Golden Gloves heavywight title in 1936.  His progess in learning to play the bass was halted when he resisted the World War II draft, and was imprisoned for ten months.  After the war, he re-united with his bass playing tutor, Baby Doo Caston, forming the Big Three Trio, who went on to record for Columbia Records.  Dixon subsequently signed for Chess Records as a recording artist, but by 1951 he was a full time employee of the label.  His relationship with them was sometimes strained, although his spell there covered the years from 1948 to the early 1960s.  During this time his output, and influence was prodigious.   
Indeed, he once claimed "I am the blues."  This may seem a little arrogant, but there is no doubt that he was one of the major influences on the genre, through his original and varied songwriting, live performances, recording, and copious production work. He later recorded on Bluesville Records.

His double bass playing was of a high standard.  He appears on many of Chuck Berry's early recordings, further proving his linkage between the blues and the birth of rock 'n' roll.

Dixon's genius as a songwriter, lay in refurbishing archaic Southern motifs, in contemporary arrangements.  This produced songs with the backbone of the blues, and the agility of pop music.  British R&B bands of the 1960's constantly drew on the Dixon songbook for inspiration.

In addition, as his songwriting and production work started to take a backseat, his organisational ability was utilised, putting together all-star, Chicago based blues ensembles for work in Europe.

His health deteriorated in the 1970s and 1980s, due to long-term diabetes, and eventually his leg had to be amputated.  It was during this latter period of his life that Willie Dixon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  As the songlist below demonstrates, his work was covered by a varied range of artists, from the blues, to modern day rock music practitioners.

Willie Dixon died of heart failure in Burbank, California in 1992 and was buried in the Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

The John Adams Building is one of three library buildings of the Library of Congress in the United States. The building was originally built simply as an annex to the Library's Main Building (the Thomas Jefferson Building). It opened its doors to the public on January 3, 1939.

History.
The idea to construct a new library building was presented to the United States Congress in 1928 at the urging of Librarian of Congress Herbert Putnam. The bill was sponsored by Robert Luce, chairman of the House Committee on the Library. On June 13, 1930, $6,500,00 was appropriated for the building's construction, for a tunnel connecting it to the Main Building, and for changes in the east front of the Main Building, including the construction of a Rare Book Room. An additional appropriation approved on June 6, 1935, brought the total authorization to $8,226,457.

Architect of the Capitol David Lynn took charge of the project and commissioned the Washington architectural firm of Pierson & Wilson to design the building, with Alexander Buel Trowbridge as consulting architect. The contract stipulated completion by June 24, 1938, but the building was not ready for occupancy until December 2, 1938. The move of the Card Division started on December 12, and it opened its doors to the public in the new building on January 3, 1939.

The building is five stories in height above ground, with the fifth story set back 35 feet. It contains 180 miles of shelving (compared to 104 miles in the Jefferson Building) and can hold ten million volumes. There are 12 tiers of stacks, extending from the cellar to the fourth floor. Each tier provides about 13 acres of shelf space.

On April 13, 1976, in a ceremony at the Jefferson Memorial marking the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, US President Gerald Ford signed into law the act to change the name of the Library of Congress Annex Building to the Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building. On June 13, 1980, the structure acquired its present name, which honors John Adams, the former President of the United States who in 1800 approved the law establishing the Library of Congress.

The building is faced in white Georgia marble and incorporated the use of new materials at the time such as acoustical block, formica, vitrolit, and glass tubing.

An eternal flame is a flame or torch that burns constantly, fed by a measured supply of propane gas or natural gas.  It is most often used as a symbol to acknowledge and remember a person or event of national significance, or a group of brave and noble people connected to some event, or even a laudable goal such as international peace.

The eternal flame to commemorate President Kennedy in the United States in 1963 was the first time in the world that an individual person was given such an honor.  Henceforward, eternal flames would be designated more frequently around the world to honor the loss of persons of great significance, in addition to major tragic events.

Eternal flames exist in nature as well, as byproducts of natural gas deposits leaking through the ground.

Parton v Milk Board (Vic) (1949) 80 CLR 229 is a High Court of Australia case that dealt with the meaning of excise in relation to section 90 of the Australian Constitution.

In this case, the tax was calculated as a fixed amount per gallon of milk, and imposed on retailers, instead of at the production phase; this was held to be invalid as imposing a duty of excise. This heralded in the broad approach to section 92 - where a "tax upon a commodity at any point in the course of distribution before it reaches the consumer produces the same effect as a tax upon its manufacture or production" (per Dixon J). Rich and Williams JJ agreed with Dixon J, stating that a tax at a later stage in the handling of a good is in effect a tax on the production or manufacture of the good.

Latham CJ dissented, using Peterswald v Bartley, and McTiernan J felt that it should be employed in a narrower sense, to make it fit within what he perceived to be the object of the section, which was to promote a "uniform fiscal policy for the Commonwealth".

Penco is a Municipality and comuna of Chile (the third oldest in the country) in the Concepción Province of the Bío-Bío Region. The name Penco comes from Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche people, and means "Peumo water".

In previous centuries, in the current location of Penco, was established the city of Concepción, now the capital of the Bío-Bío Region. Due to earthquakes and tsunamis, which razed the city in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the authorities decided to move the city to its current location to the Valle de la Mocha, along side the Bío-Bío River. The habitants who did not abandon the territory of Penco, formed the town that exists today.

To an outsider, there may be confusion between the demonyms of the inhabitants of Concepción and Penco.  Due to the previous location of Concepción, inhabitants of that city are called penquistas while inhabitants of Penco are known as pencones.

The Royal Burgess Golfing Society is a parkland golf course and is considered to be one of the oldest courses in Scotland. It is currently an exclusive golf club (situated in the area of Barnton, Edinburgh, capital of Scotland)  where the golfers are mainly middle aged and elderly men, as the club has a strict clientele. It can take a long time for a person to become a member as they must be seconded, thirded etc. Notable members include Jack Nicklaus alongside a host of royals, aristocrats and socialites.

Membership costs around £1,000 per year with initial membership around 3 to 4 times that. Women are not permitted in the member's bar but are allowed in other areas of the club if accompanied by a member.


 History .

The Royal Burgess Golfing Society first started in the Bruntsfield Links, but moved to Musselburgh Links in 1874, due to overcrowding. However, the same problem arose when in the late 1800s, golf started to become popular. They moved to their current Barnton course in 1894. The Royal Burgess has only had it's current name since 1929 when King George V ordered the name be changed from 'The Edinburgh Burgess Golfing Society.' Royals having played at the Burgess and even some becoming members include from King George V and VI to King Edward VIII and, even today, HRH The Duke of York.

F.F (Foo Fighters) is a fictional character from the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. F.F is one of Jolyne's allies in Part 6.



 Story .
Enrico Pucci had a shack of Stand disks near prison grounds, a collection of different Stands that he had collected over the years while in prison. It is generally untouched and desolate. However, he needed a guardian for these disks, least they fall in unwanted hands. He threw a random Stand disk into the ocean and hit plankton floating on the surface. Unexpectedly, F.F was born.

F.F, or Foo Fighters, was told to stay there by Pucci and to kill anyone (other than him) should they come close. Having no other purpose, she did as she was told. When Jolyne Kujo and Hermes Costello approached the shack during an outdoor activity, F.F attacked but was soundly beaten by both of them. Parched and close to disintergrating, she lamented on her meaningless life and wanted to have friends. Showing mercy, Jolyne spared her by giving her water, despite Hermes' protests. Fascinated by her savior, she showed Jolyne Jotaro Kujo
Jotaro's]] missing Stand disk in gratitude. She inhabited the body of a dead inmate and followed both of them back to prison. Although she likes the other people she have met, she has the strongest affinity for Jolyne since she gave her freedom.

Later, tricked by Pucci, she leads her friends into an ambush and suffers a severe blow to her body, knocking her Stand disk from her head. Dehydrated and nearing death, she was able to hear the dying Anasui's offer to her. He gave her permission to possess his body to pluck Jotaro's memory disk from him, not caring what happened to him as long as Jolyne would be happy. F.F. did pluck Jotaro's memory disk from Anasui's body but refused to possess it. Her spirit heals Anasui's wounds and thanks Jolyne for being her friend, glad that they met. When Jolyne pledged to retireve the disk to revive her, F.F declines, saying that it wouldn't be the real her but another F.F. She disappears in a gust of wind.

 Stand .

Foo Fighters (          f  fait zu): allows bundles of plankton to exist in a humanoid form. Interestingly, the plankton adopt the same name as the Stand. Technically, Foo Fighters has two forms: one where she is in a body and one where she is not. While not in a body, Foo Fighters has the ability to travel bodies of water super quick, spreading her plankton to faraway areas to manipulate whatever she chooses. In a body, she retains this ability by forming a pistol on her forefinger, shooting parts of herself to her enemies. The down side is that she has to be constatnly hydrated and can't fight for extended periods of time. Alternatively, F.F can heal people by using her plankton to microscopically sew wounds quickly together. Some of the most fatal wounds can be healed in a matter of seconds.

As with her name, the stand is also the name to the band Foo Fighters.

 Trivia .
 The body that F.F. inhibits belonged to a girl named Etro who is got her namesake from the fashion brand of the same name. The Initals F.F. are a marketing trademark done by the Fendi fashion brand, another tidbit to her name. ;
 Due to her plankton inhabiting the body she is in, F.F can contort in impossible curves and even slip through barred fences unharmed.
 Some people mistake F.F for a painter because of her overalls-like jumpsuit.
 When not close to a pipe or hose, she tries to keep a 32. oz cup near her at all times.
 True to her word, F.F. was the only main protagonist to not have a Steel Ball Run counterpart at the end of Part 6.

Hubbard Broadcasting Corporation is a broadcasting company based in St. Paul, Minnesota that was started by Stanley E. Hubbard.  The corporation has broadcast outlets scattered across Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and New Mexico, though the flagships are the KSTP radio and television stations serving the Twin Cities region of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.

KSTP has its origins in the Twin Cities radio station WAMD ("Where All Minneapolis Dances"), which started broadcasting live dance music from a local ballroom on February 13, 1925.  It was the first radio station to be completely supportedy by income generated by running advertisements.  Hubbard Broadcasting now operates three radio stations as well as several television stations.

In 1928, WAMD merged with KFOY radio (first broadcast: March 12, 1924) in St. Paul to become KSTP, which was advertised as being operated by the National Battery Broadcasting Co. Ten years later, in 1938, Hubbard bought the first television camera available from RCA.  Following the television blackout brought on by World War II, KSTP started television broadcasts in 1948.  More recently in the 1980s and '90s, Hubbard Broadcasting attempted an entry into satellite TV and operated U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB) for many years but this property was later sold off.

KSTP is still Hubbard's flagship, although there are now three different stations that carry that name.  KSTP-TV is affiliated with ABC.  KSTP-AM broadcasts a talk radio format, and KSTP-FM broadcasts adult contemporary music.

After the Federal Communications Commission relaxed rules about television station ownership, Hubbard bought a second television station in the Twin Cities.  Originally affiliated with the Home Shopping Network when it started operations in 1994, KVBM channel 45 was bought by Hubbard and began broadcasting as KSTC in 2000. The station is normally independent (not affiliated with any broadcast network), but it has been used by KSTP to broadcast ABC network programming when channel 5 is broadcasting coverage of Viking football games or other special shows, including severe-weather coverage.

Aside from terrestrial broadcast stations, other current ventures include the film network ReelzChannel (launched in 2006), arts network Ovation TV, and the Hubbard Radio Network, which is used to distribute KSTP-AM's local talk shows to subscribing radio stations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The cable channels are run through subsidiary company Hubbard Media Group.

Hubbard Broadcasting also owned the now-closed Bound to be Read bookstores in St. Paul, Albuquerque, and Fort Myers.

John James "Fats" Dantonio (December 31, 1918 - May 28, 1993) was a  Major League Baseball catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1944 and 1945.  "Fats" was 5'8" tall and weighed only 165 pounds.

Dantonio is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II.  He made his major league debut on September 18, 1944 in a road game against the Boston Braves at Braves Field.

He played in just 3 games in '44, then batted .250 in 47 games the next season.  His career totals for 50 games include a .244 batting average (33-for-135), 12 runs batted in, 12 runs scored, a .301 on base percentage, and a .304 slugging percentage.  As a receiver he was well below average, making 14 errors in 182 total chances for a low fielding percentage of .923.

Dantonio passed away in his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana at the age of 74.

Trivia.
Dantonio shares the exact same birthday (December 31, 1918) with former MLB catcher Al Lakeman.

Malyj Vysotskij (, ) is a Finnish island in Russian territory. It is located in Vyborg Bay, next to Vysotsk island, 12 km southwest of Vyborg. It is currently leased to Finland.

Between 1918 and 1940 the island was formally part of Finland, under the name Ravansaari. It was inhabited by nearly one thousand Finns who mainly earned their livelihood from the timber industry. In 1940, it was annexed by the Soviet Union and became part of Karelo Finnish SSR. In 1941, Ravansaari was recaptured by Finnish troops and annexed to Finland. In June 1944, the island fell to the Red Army and once again became part of the Soviet Union. The island was renamed Malyj Vysotskij. A treaty was signed in 1963 to lease the island and the nearby Saimaa Canal to Finland for fifty years.

Because of the treaty and the island's isolation from both Finland and Russia, radio amateurs have made the Malyj Vysotskij island an entity of its own, much like Hawaii or Alaska. This and the fact that Alexander Stepanovich Popov did his first radio experiments in the area at the turn of the 19th century makes the island an attractive destination for DX-peditioners. All such expeditions are organized by a Finnish-Russian group, the first of which occurred in 1988.

For the international monthly publication nicknamed Le Diplo, see Le Monde diplomatique and for the British title of the same name see Diplo magazine.
Diplo, Diplodocus, Wes Gully, and Wes Diplo are all pseudonyms of Wesley Pentz, a Philadelphia-based producer and DJ.  Together with DJ Low Budget, he runs Hollertronix, a club and music collective. In addition to his solo career, he has worked with British-based singer and artist M.I.A.. The two were also romantically involved. Pentz's alias, short for Diplodocus, derives from his childhood fascination with dinosaurs.

As a DJ, Diplo is characterized by his eclectic, often 80s-oriented mashups, mixtapes, and live sets.  On his full-length solo effort, Florida, however, his sound is closer to sample-based cinematic instrumental hip hop, like the work of DJ Shadow.

Born in Mississippi and raised across the southern United States, Diplo picked up much of the local culture while growing up there.  Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and Miami bass are now key ingredients of  Hollertronix's output.  Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk, which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.

Diplo is signed to the Ninja Tune-imprint Big Dada. In 2006, he started his own label, Mad Decent, signing Brazilian baile funk group Bonde do Role.

Pitchcapping refers to a form of torture devised by British forces in 18th century Ireland which was widely used against suspected rebels during the period of the 1798 Rebellion, most famously on Anthony Perry, one of the leaders of the Wexford rebels.



The process involved pouring hot pitch, or tar (mainly used at the time for lighting purposes), into a conical shaped paper "cap", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head and then allowed to cool. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim. The "pitchcap" was then torn off taking lumps of skin and flesh with it which usually left the victim disfigured for life.   

The torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victims hair and many accounts report that ears were often partly or fully severed during the cutting. Refinements to the torture included unbinding the victim's feet to allow the spectacle of them running about in agony and in some cases, deliberately smashing their own heads in an attempt to end the torment. Another variation involved adding turpentine or gunpowder to the pitchcap when cooled and then setting it alight.

The torture was probably devised as a response to the short "cropped" hairstyle popular in Ireland at the time (hence the nickname "croppy" given to Irish rebels), which was inspired by the French Revolutionary style which was a repudiation of the long hair and wigs of the aristocracy.

The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembles scalping, earlier known from the North American colonies.

Pitch has long, even in antiquity, been used   like other hot liquids, even melted metal   to pour into a victim's orifices. However both those techniques were usually faster and often lethal, so less suitable as torture proper, rather as capital punishment.

Stand Up and Cheer! is a 1934 motion picture about the Depression Era in the United States, and the efforts undertaken to boost the morale of the citizenry.

The film has come under criticism in recent years due to racially offensive stereotypes used in the film. Also, it is often marketed as a Shirley Temple motion picture; in reality, the child star played a minor role in the film.

Most of the racist content has been edited out in recent versions of the film.

West Sikkim is a district of the Indian state of Sikkim. Its capital is Geyzing, also known as Gyalshing. The district is a favourite with trekkers due to the high elevations. Other important towns include Pelling and Jorethang.

The district has a wide variety of fauna and flora to offer. Since most of the district is hilly it enjoys a temperate climate. Above 3,800 m (12,000 feet) the slopes are full of rhododendron forests. 

West Sikkim also has the ancient capital of the state Yuksom. It served as the capital beginning in 1642 for almost 50 years till it was shifted to Rabtense. The district was under the occupation of the Nepalese for many decades in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. After the Gorkha War, the district was returned to Sikkim.

The economy is mainly agrarian, despite most of the land being unfit for cultivation owing to the precipitous and rocky slopes. Attractions include the Khecheoperi lake which as legend has it, not a leaf is allowed to fall on the surface of the lake and the Pemyangtse monastery, the first monastery of the state.

The people are mainly of Nepali descent. Other ethnic groups include the Lepcha and Bhutia communities. Nepali is the most widely spoken language in the district. 

The region has many power projects and enjoys almost uninterrupted electricity. Roads however, are in a poor condition owing to the frequent landslides.

"Requiem for Methuselah" is a third season episode of Star Trek: Original Series, first broadcast February 14, 1969, a St. Valentine's Day. Its repeat broadcast, on September 2, 1969, was the last official telecast of the series to air on NBC. It is episode #74, production #76, written by Jerome Bixby and directed by Murray Golden. It guest-stars James Daly as "Flint", and Louise Sorel as "Rayna Kapec" .

Overview: The crew of the Enterprise encounter an immortal human in this science fiction retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest.

Plot.



On stardate 5843.7, the crew of the Enterprise is struck with a deadly disease known as Rigellian Fever and heads to the remote planet Holberg 917-G, in search of the mineral ryetalyn to manufacture an antidote. Once there, sensors detect humanoid life despite the reports that the planet is uninhabited.

Captain Kirk, along with his first officer Mr. Spock, and chief medical officer Dr. McCoy, beam down to the planet to investigate and are quickly attacked by a floating sentry robot. The robot is called off by its master, who steps forward and identifies himself as Flint. Flint claims that the landing party is trespassing on private property, and orders them to leave his planet immediately, threatening to kill them if they do not comply. 

Kirk, however, will not accept Flint's authority and calls Mr. Scott on the Enterprise to shoot a spread of phaser fire at their position if any harm comes to them. Such an attack would completely vaporize everything in the area. At first, Flint thinks Kirk is bluffing, but he finally backs down and reluctantly talks with his uninvited guests. McCoy informs Flint about the disease that threatens the Enterprise crew and about the urgent need for the minerals on the planet. Flint listens and compares the epidemic to bubonic plague in Constantinople, Earth in the summer of 1334. 

Flint allows the landing party two hours to gather the ryetalyn mineral and offers the services of his sentry robot, "M4", to find and gather the mineral for them. Meanwhile, Flint escorts the landing party back to his home. They are amazed at Flint's impressive collection of Earth artifacts which includes original copies of Shakespeare, a Gutenberg Bible, and lithographs by Terra Nullus of Centaurus VII. Spock is puzzled when his tricorder scans reveal the impressive works are new recreations made with contemporary materials. It is as if the original masters had returned to remake them. 

The party is then floored by the appearance of Flint's beautiful adopted daughter, Rayna, who instantly takes a liking to Spock. Spock is impressed with her incredible knowledge of advanced physics and the two discuss warp field density and its relationship to gravitational dynamics. Flint states that Rayna's parents used to be in his employ, but died in an accident. He has proudly assessed Rayna's knowledge to be the equivalent of 17 university art and science degrees.

Kirk plays billiards with Rayna, then they dance while Spock plays a waltz on the piano. Spock determines the waltz to be an unknown piece written by Johannes Brahms since the work seems to be written in his style and by his own hand. Back in Flint's lab, McCoy analyzes the ryetalyn gathered by M4 and discovers that it is contaminated with iridium, rendering it inert and useless.

Meanwhile, Kirk romances Rayna but M4 appears and attacks him. Spock enters just in time and destroys the robot with his phaser. Flint rushes in and Kirk confronts him about the attack. Flint excuses it as a simple misunderstanding, explaining M4 interpreted Kirk's advances toward Rayna as hostile. Kirk forgives the incident and is rather relieved of M4's demise, but is shocked when Flint quickly summons a replacement sentry.

Kirk contacts the Enterprise and asks Lt. Uhura to check out Flint's and Rayna's identities. She finds nothing except that Holberg 917-G was purchased 30 years ago by a private investor named Brack. In the meantime, Spock, using a surreptitious tricorder scan, discovers that Flint is over 6,000 years old. 

With the materials almost ready, Rayna comes to Kirk to say goodbye. Kirk is madly in love with her and begs her to come with him. McCoy then informs them that the ryetalyn is now missing and a search begins. Spock follows the tricorder readings to a hidden chamber where they find other Raynas, who are apparently all androids. 

Flint arrives and Kirk demands an explanation of what is going on. Flint confesses that he is immortal, born on Earth in Mesopotamia, in the year 3834 BC. He was first a soldier, and after falling in battle and later recovering, he learned he could live forever. As time went on he lived the lives of famous identities: Alexander the Great, Leonardo DaVinci, Johannes Brahms, William Shakespeare, King Solomon, Merlin, Methuselah, Reginald Pollack (of the late 20th century), the painter Sten from Marcus II, and many others throughout history. He explains his purpose for making Rayna was to create a mate who would never grow old, and live forever just as he can.  

Horrified, Kirk believes it's time to leave, but Flint refuses to let them go since they have learned his secret. He also claims that Kirk has taught Rayna something he has never been able to: true love. He now wants Kirk to direct Rayna's love toward himself. Kirk refuses to give into Flint's demands and contacts the Enterprise to beam them up and prepare to leave orbit.

Flint then activates a device that teleports the Enterprise to the planet, miniaturized to the size of a desktop model with the crew in a state of suspended animation, as seen by a giant Kirk peering through the viewscreen. Flint is quickly shamed into restoring the ship, but when he realizes Rayna will not turn her love to him, Flint attacks Kirk and a brawl ensues. Rayna tries to stop the fight and her feelings are torn in a logic loop between the two men. This causes the android's circuits to overload and she collapses dead on the floor. Flint and Kirk stop fighting and the two grief-stricken men mourn over Rayna's body.

Both men are devastated, but Flint regains his composure and allows Kirk to leave with the supply of ryetalyn. Back on the Enterprise McCoy discovers from his readings that Flint is dying. Only the complex fields of Earth were keeping him alive, but his life off world is now aging him normally. Kirk remains distraught over Rayna which is affecting his ability to command. Spock uses a Vulcan mind meld to help the captain either to forget Rayna or at least to forget the pain, uttering the word "forget." Kirk is then able to return to his duties. 



Trivia.

Methuselah is the longest-lived man mentioned in the Bible.  Genesis 5.27 reads, "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.";

It is believed that Spock's mind-meld with Kirk to make him "forget" was the inspiration for Harve Bennett's use of the "remember" mind-meld between Spock and McCoy at the end of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

 Leonardo da Vinci later appeared in holographic form in the VGR episodes Scorpion, Part I and Concerning Flight.  He was referenced but not seen in that series' episodes Scorpion, Part II and Darkling.

 The prop for M4 is a differently dressed version of the prop used for the space probe Nomad in the episode "The Changeling".

 Fan critics, notably Tom Lalli in "Same Sexism, Different Generation" (Best Of Trek #15) cite this episode as exemplifying the underlying sexism in Star Trek. When the female android becomes capable of independent thought and decision-making, her circuitry overloads; she can't take it. Virtually the same thing happens to Lal in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Offspring (TNG episode)". The idea that men think and women feel is a common theme in many Star Trek scripts from all eras and incarnations of the show.

Luther J. Glenn (November 26, 1818   June 9, 1886) was a prominent Georgia lawyer, politician, Confederate officer during the American Civil War, and antebellum Mayor of Atlanta.

He was married to Mildred Lewis Cobb, a younger sister of Generals Howell and Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb (Howell Cobb later served as Governor of Georgia). Glenn represented Henry County in the state legislature as a Democrat before arriving in Atlanta in 1851. Six years later, he was elected mayor and served two consecutive one-year terms. He was the first mayor to appoint regular committees in council for the various functions of city governance: Fire, Streets, Finance, etc.

In March 1861, the Southern states that had seceded from the Union appointed special commissioners to travel to those other slaveholding Southern states that had yet to secede. Glenn served as the Commissioner from Georgia to the Missouri Secession Convention, publicly reading Georgia's Articles of Secession and trying to persuade Missouri politicians to vote to join Georgia in seceding from the Union.

During the Civil War, he served first as the company commander of C Company, Cobb's Legion (Infantry), and subsequently as Lt. Colonel of Cobb's Legion. He finished the war as the commander of the Post of Atlanta. In that position, he surrendered the remaining Confederate  troops of Atlanta to Col. Beroth B. Eggleston of the 1st Ohio Cavalry on May 3,1865.

He remained in Atlanta until his death.  He was buried in Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia.

Of his sons, Howell Cobb Glenn, a lawyer, died young in 1890 and John Thomas Glenn was Mayor of Atlanta in 1889.

Daniel Berrigan, S.J. (born May 9, 1921) is an internationally renowned poet, American peace activist and Roman Catholic priest. Daniel and his brother Philip performed non-violent actions against war and were for a time on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

History.
Daniel Berrigan was born in Virginia, Minnesota, a Midwestern working class town. His father, Thomas Berrigan, was second-generation Irish-Catholic and proud Union man. Tom left the Catholic Church, but Berrigan remained attracted to the Church throughout his youth. He joined the Jesuits directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1952. He now resides in New York City and serves as the Fordham University poet in residence.

Berrigan appears briefly in the 1986 film, The Mission, directed by Roland Joffé and starring Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons. He plays a Jesuit priest and also served as a consultant on the film.

Protests against the War in Vietnam.
Berrigan, his brother Philip, and the famed Trappist monk Thomas Merton founded an interfaith coalition against the Vietnam War, and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. 

In 1969, Philip Berrigan was arrested for non-violent protest and sentenced to six years in prison. Afterwards, Daniel Berrigan seriously considered taking more direct action against the war. Howard Zinn, professor emeritus at Boston University, invited Berrigan to accompany him on a trip to Hanoi to negotiate the release of three U.S. pilots held prisoner by the North Vietnamese. Although the mission had a high chance of success, it was opposed by the FBI on the grounds that it violated their policy of non-negotiation with North Vietnam. J. Edgar Hoover went so far as to publicly call Zinn and Berrigan "traitors". U.S. planes even bombed locations where they were scheduled to be. Despite the opposition, three pilots were returned home. They were the first American POWs released unharmed by the North Vietnamese. The lack of acknowledgement and appreciation by the U.S. government helped to radicalize Berrigan.

In 1969, Berrigan decided to participate in a more radical non-violent protest. A local high-school physics teacher helped to concoct homemade napalm. Nine activists, who later became known as the Catonsville Nine, walked into the draft board of Catonsville, Maryland, and removed 378 draft files, which they brought outside and burned. The Catonsville Nine, who were all Catholic, issued a statement:
"We confront the Catholic Church, other Christian bodies, and the synagogues of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our country's crimes. We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor."

Berrigan was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, but he refused to serve his time. Instead, he went underground, living discreetly among like-minded individuals. The FBI, to its great embarrassment, was not immediately able to apprehend Berrigan, although he frequently showed up briefly at public events, made impromptu speeches, and went back into hiding. During this time Berrigan was also interviewed for a documentary titled "The Holy Outlaw," by Lee Lockwood. 

Eventually, the FBI managed to find and arrest Berrigan. He was released from prison in 1972.  After his release from prison, Berrigan spent time in France meeting with Thich Nhat Hanh, the exiled Buddhist monk peace activist from Vietnam.

He is interviewed in the 1968 anti-Vietnam War documentary film In the Year of the Pig.

The Plowshares Movement .
On September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Philip, and six others (the "Plowshares Eight") began the Plowshares Movement when they entered the General Electric Nuclear Missile Re-entry Division in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania where nose cones for the Mark 12A warheads were made. They hammered on two nose cones, poured blood on documents and offered prayers for peace. They were arrested and initially charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. On April 10 1990, after nearly ten years of trials and appeals, the Plowshares Eight were re-sentenced and paroled for up to 23 and 1/2 months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was dramatically re-created in Emile de Antonio's 1982 film In The King of Prussia, which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves. 

Since this action over seventy Plowshares actions have taken place around the world against weapons of war, several involving Berrigan himself.

Among the Plowshares Eight was Father Carl Kabat, 72, a fellow Roman-Catholic priest who is currently in prison. Kabat is the subject of the original play And Carl Laughed, written by two teachers at Clayton High School, in Clayton, MO. The play will debut this summer, performed by students from the school, at the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Other activism.
Berrigan has spoken out on many issues since then, and has been involved in many protests. He has led protests against American destabilization of Central America, the 1991 Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He is also a prominent pro-life activist. He had been a guest speaker at Regis High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school in Manhattan.

UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) is the brand name for the project within 3GPP2 to improve the CDMA2000 mobile phone standard for next generation applications and requirements. The system employs OFDMA technology along with advanced antenna techniques to provide peak rates of up to 280Mbps. Goals for UMB include significantly improving system capacity, greatly increasing user data rates throughout the cell, lowering costs, enhancing existing services, making possible new applications, and making use of new spectrum opportunities. The technology will provide users with concurrent IP-based services in a full mobility environment. The UMB standardization is expected to be completed in mid 2007, with commercialization taking place around mid-2009. 

To provide ubiquitous and universal access, UMB supports inter-technology handoffs with other  technologies including existing CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO systems.

The name Ultra Mobile Broadband communicates the key attributes of the technology: 

Ultra:  An ultra fast technology that supports more than an order of magnitude increase in broadband data throughput rates to economically deliver IP-based voice, multimedia, broadband, information technology, entertainment, and consumer electronic services within most kind of devices

Mobile:  A platform that supports several wireless services within a full mobility environment and thus differentiates itself from Wi-Fi, WiMAX, UWB, etc

Broadband:  Ultra high-speeds that are in the order of 100s of megabits per second; next-generation capabilities, beyond 3G

 UMB Summary .
OFDMA-based air interface;
Frequency Division Duplex;
Scalable bandwidth between 1.25-20 MHz (OFDMA systems are especially well suited for wider bandwidths larger than 5MHz);
Supports mixed cell sizes, e.g., macro-cellular, micro-cellular & pico-cellular.
IP network architecture;
Supports flat, centralized and mixed topologies;


 UMB Key Design Elements . 
Significantly higher data rates & reduced latencies using FL advanced antenna techniques;
MIMO, SDMA and Beamforming;
Higher RL sector capacity with quasi-orthogonal reverse link	;
Increased cell edge user data rates using adaptive interference management;
Dynamic fractional frequency reuse;
Distributed RL power control based on other cell interference;
Real time services enabled by fast seamless L1/L2 handoffs ;
Independent RL & FL handoffs provide better airlink and handoff performance;
Power optimization through use of quick paging and semi-connected state;
Low-overhead signaling using flexible airlink resource management;
Fast access and request using RL CDMA control channels;
New scalable IP architecture supports inter-technology handoffs;
New handoff mechanisms support real-time services throughout the network and across different airlink technologies;
Fast acquisition and efficient multi-carrier operation through use of beacons ;
Multi-carrier configuration supports incremental deployment & mix of low-complexity & wideband devices;

UMB Benefits.

UMB is intended to be a so-called fourth-generation technology. These technologies use an high bandwidth, low latency, underlying TCP/IP network with high level services such as voice built on top. While no 4G networks have been deployed yet, the much greater amount of bandwidth, and much lower latencies, should enable the use of various application types that have previously been impossible, while continuing to deliver high quality (or higher quality) voice services. The improved bandwidths of the network provided by more efficient technologies may also result in networks with better capacity.

UMB's use of OFDMA eliminates many of the disadvantages of the CDMA technology used by its predecessor, including the "breathing" phenomenon, the difficulty of adding capacity via microcells, and the fixed bandwidth sizes that limit the total bandwidth available to handsets.

<doc id="1627233" title="Baron Sigmund Zois von Edelstein" nonfiltered="203" processed="201" dbindex="1480203">

Sigmund Zois (´iga Zois) (23 November 1747 in Trieste - 10 November 1819 in Ljubljana) studied natural sciences with Gabriel Gruber and Joseph Maffei in Ljubljana. 

Sigmund was born in Ljubljana (capital of present Slovenia) in 1747.

Sigmund's father, Michelangelo Zois was a Venitian salesman who moved to Ljubljana where he made a considerable fortune. He married a Slovenian noblewoman and acquired the right to the title of baron.

After attending several private schools, Sigmund Zois moved to Italy where he continued his education. He enjoyed traveling and getting acquainted to new people. However, his way of life was soon truncated by gout, a disease that would stuck him for the rest of his life. After returning to Ljubljana, he developed a strong interest in sciences and worked with Baltazar Hacquet and other Slovenian intellectuals. 

In 1780, his house in Ljubljana became a fostering center for liberal intellectuals at the center of the Slovenian enlightenment. Jurij Japelj, Bla¸ Kumerdej, Jernej Kopitar, Anton Toma¸ Linhart, Valentin Vodnik were all members of the  Zois circle . 

Zois was their mecenate (patron), he mentored them and granted financial support, and becamethe central figure of the Slovenian enlightenment. He was a deist and his views were rational and empirical. Nevertheless, he strongly disagreed with the French revolution.

Literary work by Sigmund Zois includes many literary forms and genres, ranging from arias for the opera to lyrics for folk music, although probably only a minor part of his work has been preserved. His translation of the poem Lorelei by Gottfried August Burger was regarded as a complete failure, and Zois himself later came to believe that the Slovenian language was too mediocre and rough to allow for such a literary achievement. He would be disproven only some decades later by France Pre¨eren who managed to compose a complex and exceptional translation of the same poem. Zois is also regarded as a father of Slovenian literary criticism, most of his literary reviews can be found in his correspondence with Valentin Vodnik.

He worked in mineralogy, geology, botany and zoology. His collection of minerals (around 5,000 items) is kept in a museum in Ljubljana.

In 1795 he mounted two expeditions to explore the land around the Triglav mountain. In 1805 a mineral zoisite was named after him, since Zois correctly judged that the finding of Simon Presern in the Alps in Carinthia represented an unknown mineral.

Sigmund also helped his brother, a botanist Karl Zois, the discoverer of Campanula zoysii. The main award for science and also a state scholarship for talented students in Slovenia is named after ´iga Zois.

<doc id="1450863" title="Early Muslim sociology" nonfiltered="207" processed="205" dbindex="1480207">
Early Muslim sociology responded to the challenges of social organization of diverse peoples all under common religious organization in the Islamic caliphate, the Abbasid and later Mamluk period in Egypt. It was rooted in methods from early Muslim philosophy and it reflected the strong concern of Islam with social cohesion.

 Social responsibility in commerce .
The development of Islamic banks and Islamic economics was a side effect of this sociology: usury was rather severely restrained, no interest rate was allowed, and investors were not permitted to escape the consequences of any failed venture - all financing was equity financing (Musharaka). In not letting borrowers bear all the risk/cost of a failure, an extreme disparity of outcomes between "partners" is thus avoided. Ultimately this serves a social harmony purpose.

Muslims also could not and cannot (in shariah) finance any dealings in forbidden goods or activities e.g. alcohols, pork, gambling etc. Thus ethical investing is the only acceptable investing, and moral purchasing is encouraged.

 Ecological responsibility .
Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of natural capital, i.e. producing land. Traditions of haram and hima and early urban planning were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within carrying capacity and to preserve the natural environment as an obligation of khalifa or "stewardship".

 Khaldun's conflict theory .
Without doubt the most important figure in early Muslim sociology was Ibn Khaldun, who conceived both a central social conflict ("town" versus "desert") as well as a theory (using the concept of a "generation") of the necessary loss of power of city conquerors coming from the desert.

Sati' al-Husri suggested that his Muqaddimah is essentially a sociological work, sketching over its six books a general sociology; a sociology of politics; a sociology of urban life; a sociology of economics; and a sociology of knowledge.

 Asibiyah .
Khaldun's central concept of asabiyah, or "social cohesion," seems to anticipate modern conceptions of social capital arising in social networks:

This cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; and it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds - psychological, sociological, economic, political - of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion.

Interestingly, Khaldun's concept is instinctive and does not involve any social contract or explicit forms of constitution or other instructional capital that would provide a basis for appeals, in law or otherwise.

 Khaldun's economics .
A similar dialectic approach was taken to describe the sociological implications of tax choices, which is now of course part of economics:

"In the early stages of the state, taxes are light in their incidence, but fetch in a large revenue...As time passes and kings succeed each other, they lose their tribal habits in favor of more civilized ones. Their needs and exigencies grow...owing to the luxury in which they have been brought up. Hence they impose fresh taxes on their subjects...and sharply raise the rate of old taxes to increase their yield...But the effects on business of this rise in taxation make themselves felt. For business men are soon discouraged by the comparison of their profits with the burden of their taxes...Consequently production falls off, and with it the yield of taxation."

This analysis anticipates the modern economic concept known as the Laffer Curve.

 Khaldun's history .
The Muqaddimah further emphasized the role of systemic bias in affecting the standard of evidence. Khaldun was quite concerned with the effect of raising standard of evidence when confronted with uncomfortable claims, and relaxing it when given claims that seemed reasonable or comfortable. He was a jurist, and sometimes participated reluctantly in rulings that he felt were coerced, based on arguments he didn't respect.

Khaldun had few successors in his thinking about history until Arnold J. Toynbee, a 20th century British historian.

 Similarity to modern sociology .
Early Muslim sociology is more like that of Hegel or Marx in emphasizing dialectic or feedback loops, or like systems theory as applied in such fields as corporate social responsibility, than it is like that of Weber and others who emphasize structures. There is a remarkable similarity between modern economic ideas and the sociology and economics especially of Khaldun, who lived a remarkably eventful life.

The Icarians were a French utopian movement, founded by Étienne Cabet.

American Settlement.

In 1848, a group of 1500 Icarians, followers of Cabet's books and principles, joined Cabet at Le Havre, France, to settle in the United States. They landed at New Orleans and settled near Fort Worth, Texas. They came to America to establish a communal settlement based on Cabet's ideas, and in the early 1850s they came at this time to occupy the community at Nauvoo, Illinois formerly inhabited by the Mormons. They chose Nauvoo because it was built for communal living and dining, In the 1850s, political disagreements divided the Icarians. Cabet himself and some followers went to St. Louis, but most of the community moved west to Corning, Iowa to establish a colony of "New Icaria". The colony at Corning was granted a charter of incorporation by the state of Iowa in 1860. This group officially disbanded in 1878. A new colony was established in California, but it also disbanded by 1886. A related group in Iowa continued to stay together, but they too finally disbanded in 1898.

Communal Living.

The Icarians (in German, Ikariens) lived in communal dwellings of dormitories that shared central living and dining areas. Children were raised in a community creche, not just by their own parents. Tasks were divided among the group; one might be a seamstress and never need to cook.

Political Context.

Cabet was strongly influenced by events of the Revolution of 1830, in which a democratic uprising forced the restored French monarchy to grant a new constitution respecting civil rights. These rights were diminished over time, and Cabet wrote a utopian work about an ideal society. When the Revolution of 1848 established the Second Republic, it became clear that Cabet's utopian ideals could not be implemented with all the baggage of French history, so he struck out for America to start a new society from a completely blank slate. 

Victor Hugo's Les Misérables describes the events of 1848. Karl Marx's vision of a perfect worker's utopia was strongly influenced by both Cabet's idealism and by the proof of it as a working reality in Illinois and Iowa.

The Minor Counties play three-day matches at a level below that of the first-class game.  At present, Dorset competes in the Western Division of the Minor Counties Championship.

Honours.
 Minor Counties Championship (1) - 2000;
 MCCA Knockout Trophy (1) - 1988;

Earliest cricket.
Cricket must have reached Dorset via neighbouring Hampshire by the end of the 17th century.

An advertisement in the Sherborne Mercury dated Tuesday 9 May 1738 is the earliest reference for cricket in Dorset.  Twelve Dorchester men at Ridgway Races challenged twelve men from elsewhere to play them at cricket for the prize of twelve pairs of gloves valued at a shilling a pair.

Origin of club.
According to Wisden there was county organisation in existence in either 1862 or 1871.  The present Dorset CCC was founded on 5 February 1896 and first entered the Minor Counties Championship in 1902.

Club history.

Dorset has won the Minor Counties Championship once, in 2000. 

Dorset has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy once since its inception in 1983. It won in 1988.

<doc id="8398201" title="Tanapox" nonfiltered="215" processed="213" dbindex="1480215">
Tanapox (a virus from the genus Yatapoxvirus), was first seen among individuals in the flood plain of the Tana River in Kenya during two epidemics (1957 and 1962) of acute febrile illness accompanied by localized skin lesions.


 Epidemiology .
Human tanapox has been mostly documented in Kenya and Zaire, but it is believed to occur much more widely throughout tropical Africa. All age groups and both sexes appear to be affected by this virus. During the Kenyan epidemics of 1957 and 1962, cases of tanapox were reported more frequently among persons who worked or played close to the river. As a result of this, researchers concluded that tanapox is most likely a zoonosis. However, neither the reservoir host nor the mode of transmission from wild animal to human is know. It is hypothesized that tanapox virus may be transferred from monkeys or another reservoir host to humans by infected arthropods that act as mechanical vectors. Only one case of human to human transmission has been reported.

 Incubation Period .
The incubation period in human cases is unknown, but in a person who underwent voluntary inoculation, erythema and central thickening appeared by the fourth day following infection.

 Symptomatology and Outcomes .
Most patients present a mild preeruptive fever that lasts 3-4 days, severe headaches and backaches, and often itching at the site where the skin lesion develops.

There is initially a small nodule, without any central abrasion. This small nodule soon becomes papular and gradually enlarges to reach a maximum diameter of about 15 mm by the end of the second week of infection. The draining nymph nodes are also enlarged and tender from about the fifth day following the appearance of the skin lesion. The lesion remains mostly nodular but, ulcerates during the third week and then gradually heals within 5 to 6 weeks, leaving a scar.

In Kenya, the lesions were almost always solitary and were found on the upper arm, face, neck, and truck. Conversely, in Zaire, 22% of patients had multiple lesions, usually two or three. The maximum number of lesions seen in one patient was ten. In the case of Zairian patients, the lesions were mostly found on the lower limbs, with a couple of patients reporting lesions on the upper limbs, trunk, and head.

 Pathology and Pathogenesis .
Tanapox virus in humans produces increased thickening of the epidermis with extensive, degeneration of the prickle cell layer. The cytoplasm of the swollen epidermal cells is filled with large, pleomorphic, eosinophilic B-type inclusion bodies. Nuclei of infected cells are also swollen, with chromatin being concentrated at the nuclear periphery.

To encourage and assist each student to achieve and enjoy their academic, physical, social and spiritual potential. This aligns with the school's vision which is Caring for their tomorrow - today.

 History .
The school was established on former farm land which was gifted to the local church for the establishment of the school. Local church member, Kevin Chugg built two classrooms at a total cost of $16,000.

The School buildings have also changed over time. As early as 1995 the school only had two building, the white building at the top of the school (which is due to be knocked down and a new set of classrooms built in a matter of months) and the old Primary school rooms (which are being knocked down in a matter of weeks, but since then has had major redevelopments done to it, and will continue to do so.

 Extra-curricular Activities .
Primary school students are encouraged to set their minds to work, including learning to play games such as chess.

The high school also has a choir called "Zealos". Led by two of the schools teachers, this chior has been on tours of Queensland and Northern New South Wales as well as Victoria, and have even recorded there own album entitled "Better Way" which was put together entirely by the students.

Joanne P. McCallie, 38 years old, of Brunswick, Maine, is the head coach of the Michigan State University women's basketball team, where she has been since 2000.

McCallie, who was named to the position on March 27, 2000, became just the fourth head coach in Michigan State women's basketball history. She replaced Karen Langeland, who retired following 24 years as the head coach at MSU.

McCallie arrived at MSU after spending eight years as the head coach at the University of Maine. During her tenure with the Black Bears, McCallie guided Maine to a record of 167-73, six-straight NCAA Tournament appearances, two North Atlantic Conference Championships, two America East Conference Championships and five regular-season conference titles.

McCallie guided the Black Bears to seven-straight 20-win campaigns, including a 20-11 overall record in 1999-2000 and their sixth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance. She was named conference coach of the year three times, twice in the North Atlantic Conference (1995 and 1996) and once in the America East (1999).

Prior to taking her first head coaching position, McCallie was an assistant coach at Auburn University from 1988-92. As the team's primary recruiter, she helped sign the fourth-ranked class in the nation in 1990-91 and the 16th-ranked class in 1991-92. While at Auburn, McCallie and the Tigers appeared in two national championship games and made an appearance in the NCAA Elite Eight. 

No stranger to the Big Ten, McCallie, then Palombo, played her collegiate basketball at Northwestern University from 1984-87. She still ranks seventh in Wildcat history with 378 career assists. As a senior, she was an All-Big Ten honorable mention selection and helped lead the Wildcats to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. McCallie also was named Academic All-Big Ten First-Team as a senior.

McCallie graduated from Northwestern in 1987 with a degree in political science and earned a master's degree in business administration from Auburn in 1990. 

Coach P (Palombo), as she is known by her players, is an active speaker within the community and for women's athletics. At MSU, McCallie created the "Choice Not Chance" philosophy, which focuses on making the correct choices in life. The philosophy has been widely used by McCallie, her staff and players, who have been very active in the area schools speaking about "CNC". 

In addition, McCallie's community service includes working with the Big Brothers and Big Sisters "Jump" program; serving as the Honorary Chair for the Haven House -- a shelter for homeless families in East Lansing, Michigan; serving as the Honorary Chair for the 2001 Crop Walk and the 2001-04 Memory Walks for Alzheimer's; and holding the Joanne P. McCallie Golf Challenge benefitting children and adolescents with cancer. 

While at Maine, she organized an event called "Realizing the Dream; Celebrating Women in Athletics" that featured speakers Dr. Donna Lopiano and Sheryl Swoopes. During the 1997-98 season, Dana Rae Warren filmed a documentary of the Maine women's basketball season. She was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004. 

McCallie was named a conference captain by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 2002. 

Joanne and her husband, John McCallie, Ph.D., have a 10-year-old daughter, Madeline (Maddie), and a 4-year-old son, John Wyatt (Jack).

<doc id="260084" title="East Hampton (village), New York" nonfiltered="220" processed="218" dbindex="1480220">

East Hampton is a village in Suffolk County, New York on the South Shore of Long Island. As of the United States 2000 Census, the village population was 1,334.

The Village of East Hampton is a wealthy community on the southern coast of Long Island, New York, known for its green farmland next to scenic beaches, and its many famous residents. The village is a small, more exclusive area of the Town of East Hampton.

 History .
Founded in 1648 by English farmers, East Hampton remained a quiet farming community until the late 1800s, when it began to develop as a resort for the wealthy upper class from New York City. It has become a major weekend destination for New York City residents during the summer. The area around East Hampton is also referred to colloquially as "The Hamptons."

 Famous Natives .
Howard Dean;

Beaches.
East Hampton's Main Beach consistently ranks as one of America's Top Ten beaches as ranked by "Dr. Beach" Stephen B. Leatherman.

Parking access to the Atlantic Ocean beaches within the incorporated village of East Hampton is severely restricted  from May 1 to September 30.  In 2006 there were only 2,600 permits available for non-residents with a charge of $250.  Residents can always get parking permits.  

East Hampton's beaches are considered very desirable because of their clean white sands, the fact they are relatively accessible, and connected to the main land (rather than being on a barrier island) and because there is a minimum of development adjoining the beach.  None of the village beaches have an abundance of parking and this limits the crowd size.  There is no restriction preventing people from arriving at the beaches via bike, foot or being dropped off.  Severe restrictions on neighborhood streets surrounding the beaches prohibit parking.  

The beaches of East Hampton village (from west to east):

Georgica - This beach adjoining Georgica Pond is popular with surfers because of currents arounds its controversial groynes.  The beach has bathroom facilities.
Main Beach - The beach is the only one with a pavillion where you can get food and also has a limited number of lockers available to residents.
Wiborg Beach - Has a parking lot, and is right next to Maidstone Club. It does not have a lifeguard. In the summer of 2006 it played host to the "hot" surf spot to be at. ;
Egypt Lane Beach - This beach is sometimes called Maidstone Beach because of its close proximity to the headquarters of the Maidstone Golf Club.  However this is inaccurate since there is a Maidstone Beach on the bay in an unincorporated area of East Hampton.  Main, Wiborg and Egypt Lane are immediately next to the Maidstone Golf Club course.
Two Mile Hollow - This beach has the second largest parking lot of the village beaches.  ;

In addition to the village beaches there are beaches in unincorporated East Hampton (town), New York in the hamlets of Wainscott, Amagansett, Napeauge and Montauk.

There are also an assortment of beaches on Long Island Sound and its bays on the north side of the town running the length of the town.

<doc id="23964" title="PlayStation" nonfiltered="221" processed="219" dbindex="1480221">






The  is a video game console of the fifth generation, first produced by Sony Computer Entertainment in the mid-1990s. The original PlayStation was the first of the notorious PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices, which has included successor machines including the Net Yaroze, PSone (a smaller version of the original), PocketStation, PlayStation 2, a revised, slimline PS2, PlayStation Portable, PSX (Japan only), and PlayStation 3. 
By March 2005, the PlayStation/PSone had shipped a total of over 100.49 million units, becoming the first home console to ever reach the 100 million mark.

 History .


The first conceptions of the PlayStation date back to 1986. Nintendo had been attempting to work with disk technology since the Famicom, but the medium had problems. Its rewritable magnetic nature could be easily erased (thus leading to a lack of durability), and the disks were a piracy danger. Consequently, when details of CDROM/XA (an extension of the CD-ROM format that combines compressed audio, visual and computer data, allowing all to be accessed simultaneously) came out, Nintendo was interested. CDROM/XA was being simultaneously developed by Sony and Philips. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the "SNES-CD". A contract was struck, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed "The Father of PlayStation," was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the 8 channel ADPCM sound synthesis set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities. 

Sony also planned to develop another, Nintendo compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super Nintendo cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design.  This was also to be the format used in SNES-CD discs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.

In 1989, the SNES-CD was to be announced at the June CES . However, when Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realized that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNESCD-ROM format. Yamauchi was furious; deeming the contract totally unacceptable, he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Indeed, instead of announcing their partnership, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that they were now allied with Philips, and were planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips headquarters in Europe and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature   one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.

The 9am CES announcement was a complete shock. Not only was it a complete surprise to the show goers (Sony had only just the previous night been optimistically showing off the joint project under the "Play Station" brand), but it was seen by many in the Japanese business community as a massive betrayal: a Japanese company snubbing another Japan-based company in favor of a European one was considered absolutely unthinkable in Japanese business.

After the collapse of the joint project, Sony considered halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what they had developed so far and make it into a complete, stand alone console. This led to Nintendo filing a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in U.S. federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of the Play Station, on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction. Thus, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the new Sony PlayStation was revealed; it is theorized that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.

By the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the "Sony Play Station" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip.  However, at this point, Sony realized that the SNES technology was getting long in the tooth, and the next generation of console gaming was around the corner: work began in early 1993 on reworking the "Play Station" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software; as part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped, the space between the names was removed, and the PlayStation was born.

Launch.
The PlayStation was launched in Japan on December 3 1994, the United States on September 9 1995, Europe on September 29 1995 and Asia-Pacific in November 1995.  In America, Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre including Battle Arena Toshinden, Twisted Metal, Warhawk, Philosoma, and Ridge Racer.  Almost all of Sony's and Namco's launch titles went on to produce numerous sequels.

Launch price in the American market: US$ 299.00 , a price point later used by its successor, the PlayStation 2.

The PlayStation was also able to generate interest with a unique slew of ad campaigns.  Many of the ads released at the time of launch were full of ambiguous content which had many gamers rabidly debating their meanings.  The most well-known launch ads include the "Enos Lives" campaign, and the "U R Not e" ads (the "e" in "U R Not e" was always colored in red, to symbolize the word "ready", and the "Enos" meant "ready Ninth Of September", the U.S. launch date). The Enos ad could also be read as Sony written backward with phonetic sound of "E" replacing the "y". It is believed that these ads were an attempt to play off the gaming public's suspicion towards Sony as an unknown, untested entity in the video game market. The PlayStation 3 slogan, "PLAY B3YOND", resembles this slogan, as the 3 is red.

Titles.
Well known titles on the  PlayStation include , Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy VII, Gran Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver , Metal Gear Solid, Parasite Eve, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Spyro The Dragon, Tekken, Tomb Raider, and Wipeout . The very last game for the system was FIFA Football 2005.  As of May 18 2004, Sony has shipped 100 million PlayStation and PSone consoles throughout the world. As of September 2006, 7,902 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles) with cumulative software shipment of 961 million units. The PlayStation logo was designed by Manabu Sakamoto, who also designed the logo for Sony's VAIO computer products.

Production run.
Having lasted over 11 years, the PlayStation has enjoyed one of the longest production runs in the videogame industry. On March 23, 2006, Sony announced the end of production. 

Variants.
The first new version was actually a revision in early 1996, produced in response to complaints that PlayStations were overheating. Sony did not change the technical aspects or the cosmetics but did remove the RCA ports left over from the Japanese release. The parallel port (which was mostly unused by Sony) was also removed to reduce production costs. Sony also slightly improved the laser assembly. 

Many gamers experienced skipping full-motion video or dreaded physical "ticking" noises coming from their PlayStations.  The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments   the plastic moldings inside the console would warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly.  The solution was to ensure the console was sat on a surface which dissipated heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly by propping something at its edges.  A common fix for already affected consoles was to turn the PlayStation sideways or upside-down (thereby using gravity to cancel the effects of the warped interior) although some gamers smacked the lid of the PlayStation to make a game load or work. 

Sony then released a version dubbed "Dual Shock", which included a controller with 2 analog thumbsticks and a built in force-feedback feature.

Another version that was colored blue (as opposed to regular console units that were grey in color) was available to game developers and select press. Later versions of this were colored green - on a technical level, these units were almost identical to the retail units, but had a different CD controller in them that did not require the region code found on all pressed disks, since they were intended to be used with CD-R media for debugging - this also allowed the use of discs from different regions, but this was not officially supported, and different debug stations existed for each region.  The two different color cases were not cosmetic - the original blue debug station (DTL-H100x, DTL-H110x) contained "Revision B" silicon, the same as the early retail units (these units had silicon errata that needed software workarounds), the green units (DTL-H120x) had Rev. C hardware. As part of the required tests, you had to test your title on both. Contrary to popular belief, the RAM was the same as the retail units at 2MB.  The firmware was nearly identical - the only significant change was that debug printf()s got sent to the serial port if the title didn't open it for communications - this used a DTL-H3050 serial cable (the same as the one used for the Yaroze).

A number of these units appeared on the secondary market (at generally high prices), and were popular because they would run games from any region and CD-R copies, which tended to result them in commanding high prices.  All the blue units tend to have CD problems, but the DTL-H110x units (with an external PSU block) are significantly more reliable than the original DTL-H100x ones.

A white version was also produced that had the ability to play VCDs - this was only sold in Asia, since that format never really caught on anywere else. From a developer perspective, the white PSX could be treated exactly like any other NTSC:J PlayStation.
 
The installation of a modchip allowed the PlayStation's capabilities to be expanded, and several options were made available. By the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to realize the modification of the console. Such a modification allowed the playing of games from other regions, such as PAL titles on a NTSC console, or allowed the ability to play illicit copies of original games without restriction. Modchips allows the playing of games recorded on a regular CD-ROM. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free GNU compiler tools, as well as the illegal reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console was very attractive to Programmers and Pirates alike. 

Individuals that insisted on creating copies of games that would play as their original counterparts faced many issues at the time, as the discs that were produced by Sony were designed to be difficult to copy - and impossible to copy on recordable media. Not only did the original discs have a specific black tint to them, they were mastered with a specific wobble in the leadin - when amplified and sliced this contained a 4 character sequence that was checked by the CD-ROM drives mechacon chip, and the drive would only accept the disk if it was correct (this string varied depending on the region of the disk - "SCEI" for NTSC:J machines, "SCEA" for NTSC:U/C machines, "SCEE" for PAL machines and "SCEW" for the Net Yaroze). Since the tracking pattern is pressed into the disc at the time of manufacture and CD-Rs have a clean spiral, this cannot be reproduced on a CD-ROM recorder.  Some companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodifed retail units, but this was beyond the average pirate.  The other issue was that most PC drives used Mode 1 or Mode 2/Form 1 (2048 bytes/sector) and the PSX used a mixed-mode format with most data in Mode 2/Form 1 and streaming audio/video data in Mode 2/Form 2 - which a lot CD-R drives at the time could not handle well. Even after accurate copies were made, you still needed a modchip to send the correct code to the CD controller to enable the disc to be read (if a disk failed the security checks, it could be played as an audio CD, but the CD controller would reject any attempt at data transfers from it).

The creation and mass-production of these inexpensive modchips, coupled with their ease of installation, truly marked the beginning of console videogame piracy. Coincidentally, CD-ROM burners were made available around this time. Before this, the reproduction of copyrighted material for gaming consoles was restricted to either A.) People with exceptional ability, or B.) Access to very serious plastics manufacturing plants. With this console, Joe Public could replicate anything Sony was producing for a mere fraction of the MSRP.

Net Yaroze.
A version of the PlayStation called the Net Yaroze was also produced. It was more expensive than the original PlayStation, colored black instead of the usual gray, and most importantly, came with tools and instructions that allowed a user to be able to program PlayStation games and applications without the need for a full developer suite, which cost many times the amount of a PlayStation and was only available to approved video game developers. Naturally, the Net Yaroze lacked many of the features the full developer suite provided. Programmers were also limited by the 2 MB of total game space that Net Yaroze allowed. That means the entire game had to be crammed into the 2 MB of system RAM. The user couldn't officially make actual game discs. The amount of space may seem small, but games like Ridge Racer ran entirely from the system RAM (except for the streamed music tracks). It was unique in that it was the only officially retailed Sony PlayStation with no regional lockout; it would play games from any territory.



PSone.
The PSone (also PSOne, PS one, or PS1), launched in 2000, is Sony's smaller (and redesigned) version of its PlayStation video game console. The PSone is about one-third smaller than the original PlayStation (38mm × 193 mm × 144 mm versus 45 mm × 260 mm × 185 mm). It was released in July 7, 2000, and went on to outsell all other consoles including Sony's own brand-new PlayStation 2 throughout the remainder of the year. Sony also released a small LCD screen and an adaptor to power the unit for use in cars. The PSone is fully compatible with all PlayStation software. The PlayStation is now officially abbreviated as the "PS1" or "PSone," although many people still abbreviate it "PS" or "PSX". There were three differences between the "PSone" and the original, the first one being cosmetic change to the console, the second one was the home menu's Graphical User Interface, and the third being added protection against the mod-chip by changing the internal layout and making previous-generation mod-chip devices unusable.  The PSone also lacks the original PlayStation's serial port, which allowed multiple consoles to be hooked up for multi-TV multiplayer. The serial port could also be used for an external mod-chip, which may have been why it was removed, although size-constraints may also be to blame.

Trivia.
The OK and Cancel buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation's games are reversed in their American and European releases. In Japan, the Circle button (maru, right) is universally used as the OK button, while the X button (batsu, wrong) is used as the Cancel one. American and European releases have the X button as the OK button, while the Circle or the Triangle buttons are used as the Cancel ones. However, a few games such as Squaresoft's Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VII, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and Konami's Metal Gear Solid, have the buttons remain in the same Japanese configuration in their American and European releases. These Japanese button layouts still apply to newer PlayStation consoles, such as the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and PlayStation 2.

Successors.



Sony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backward compatible with its predecessor, in the sense that it can play almost every PlayStation game. This was done by embedding the most important parts of the PSone inside the PlayStation 2 design. Unlike emulators that run on the PC, the PlayStation 2 actually contains the original PlayStation processor, allowing games to run exactly as they do on the PlayStation. For PlayStation 2 games this processor, called the IOP, is used for input and output (memory cards, DVD drive, network, and hard drive). Like its predecessor, the PlayStation 2 is based on hardware developed by Sony themselves.

The next generation of the PlayStation is known as PlayStation 3, or PS3, and has been launched in November 2006 for North America and Japan, and will be launched on the 23rd March 2007 in Europe. Sony has stated the PS3 will also be backward compatible with all games that were originally made for PlayStation 1 as well as the PlayStation 2. (First-party) PS3 games will not be region-locked, but PlayStation 1 and 2 games will still only play on a PS3 console from the same territory.

The PlayStation Portable (officially PSP) is a handheld game console first released in late 2004.  Despite the name, it is not compatible with PlayStation games; it only runs games developed specifically for the PSP on the UMD format. However, at the PlayStation Briefing conference on March 15, 2006 in Japan, Sony revealed plans for PlayStation 1 games to be downloaded and playable on the PSP through emulation. Sony hopes to release nearly all PlayStation 1 games on a gradual basis. .  However, as of late December 2006, a custom firmware release allows users to play PS1 image files coverted into the PSP's EBOOT format.

The success of the PlayStation is widely thought to have had some influence on the demise of the cartridge-based home console.  While not the first system to utilize an optical disc format, it was the first success story, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges - the Nintendo 64.  Nintendo was very public about its skepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues.  It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with piracy, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue.  The success of Sony's PlayStation introduced high-quality sound and longer playing times as top priorities for modern gamers, leaving little choice for competitors but to follow suit.



Controversy.
To celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the PlayStation in 2005, Sony Italy released an advertisement portraying a young man wearing a crown of thorns (the thorns being made of triangle, square, circle and cross symbols, the labels on the buttons of Playstation controllers), on his head.  The ad was captioned with "Dieci anni di passione" (In English, this translates to "Ten years of passion.") The ad, assumed to be a takeoff of Mel Gibson's controversial 2004 movie The Passion of the Christ, was met with outrage from the Vatican. Sony apologized and stopped displaying the ad.

Quality of construction.
The laser in the CD player of early units was built into a plastic tray that slid back and forth on a set of metal tracks. Over time, friction caused the plastic tray to wear out-- usually unevenly. Eventually, the tray would become so worn that the laser no longer pointed directly at the CD and games would not load. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the tray out of die-cast metal.

A common   but temporary   fix to the laser problem was to tip the PlayStation on its side. This made the tray "hang" perpendicular to the CD, allowing the PlayStation to read the disc. Unfortunately, friction would continue to wear down the plastic tray and, eventually, the PlayStation would not read the disc. 

Some units, particularly the early 100x models, would be unable to play FMV or music correctly, resulting in skipping or freezing. In more extreme cases the PlayStation would only work correctly when used upside down.

<doc id="6869593" title="Wii homebrew" nonfiltered="223" processed="221" dbindex="1480223">
Wii homebrew refers to the reuse of Nintendo's Wii game console hardware, accessories and software for purposes outside of those intended by the manufacturer. Key objectives are to provide open source tools to expand or alter the capabilities provided "out of the box".

At present good progress has been made on using the Wii controller as a pointing device on other operating systems. A long term goal is to run unsigned software on the console to allow homebrew games and applications to be used.

The support for Adobe Flash Player in the supplied Opera browser is being used to allow the development of games and applications which can be hosted within the browser environment. This kind of software is very limited in its ability to interact directly with the Wii hardware.

Homebrew software.
One of the most important goals being worked on is the ability to run homebrew games and applications that are not licensed by Nintendo. Due to the similarity between the Wii and the Nintendo GameCube hardware, it is hoped that the bulk of the homebrew development tools used for the GameCube will be usable in the Wii with little modification. However, the Wii includes improved protection against the execution of unauthorised executable code, and at present there is no identified method to bypass this protection.

It is currently possible to run GameCube homebrew on the Wii by using an Action Replay disc and an SD memory card adaptor, but the Wii limits most of its hardware to the capabilities of the GameCube in this mode, making it impossible to use the Wii's advanced features. One of the methods for running true Wii homebrew would involve finding a way to deactivate these limitations, bringing the Wii out of GameCube mode.

The Wii optical drive is very similar to that of the GameCube, and is believed it may have similar flaws and backdoors. The intention of Nintendo to add support for standard DVDs indicates it should be possible to persuade the Wii software to read standard DVDs to load programs and data. On the GameCube, this was a popular method for running homebrew software.

A published exploit in the current trial Opera browser for the Wii causes the system to crash. By crafting a carefully formatted page to take advantage of the exploit it might be possible to run executable code on the Wii. However, as the trial version of Opera will be updated in the next couple of months it is expected this exploit will be corrected by the vendor.

 Linux on the Wii .
As with many other platforms, there is an effort to port the Linux kernel and utilities to the Wii. As the Wii includes 802.11b/g hardware, a pointing device (the Wii Remote), USB ports, Bluetooth, an SD card slot, and internal Flash memory, it is more amenable to the porting of Linux than the older GameCube. It is thus expected that Linux on the Wii will be more popular and find many more uses than GameCube Linux. As the Wii is relatively cheap, it could provide a very good platform for small servers, media centers, and for general integration of traditionally desktop-computer based applications into a living room environment.

It is hoped that parts of GameCube Linux will be directly reusable on the Wii. Drivers will need to be developed for the extra features of the Wii, including the SD card slot and the wireless 802.11b/g and Bluetooth hardware. A driver for the Wii Remote is also required, and is already being developed for desktop Linux.

To run Linux, the capability to run native executable code is required. Thus, that issue must be addressed before development can proceed.

 Streaming Media on Wii .
The Adobe Flash support in the Opera browser has been used to enable the Wii to stream arbitrary content such as media files. An example is a java daemon called Wiisic which makes MP3 files on your PC available on your Wii via a local url. A more extensive solution has been developed called WiiCR. It acts as a streaming media server and is capable of transcoding nearly any video file for use with a flash player embedded in a local web page. It allows browsing of the remote filesystem to view video, images, text files, and play MP3s.

PC Software titled ORB from www.orb.com when installed on a capable PC can be used with the Opera browser to stream many types of media as well as recorded tv from a PC to the Wii.  This even works over an internet connection.

 Wii Remote .
A number of features of the Wii Remote have been reverse engineered allowing the development of drivers for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. The Bluetooth HID driver is used to interface with the computer using a custom report format.

 Official Avenues .
On 26th January 2007, Nintendo told 'Computer and Video Games' magazine that they had 'developed a programming system that will allow small independent developers to make games for Wii download service.' They declined to state the details of how this service would function. 

 Sites and projects .
Information on Wii internals is still largely incomplete, particularly the method the Wii uses to validate and execute code. As a result most of the effort to date has been the reuse of the Wii remote with other operating systems rather than modifications to the console itself.

To date, most of the various web sites serve to accumulate known information and link to third party accomplishments.

GlovePIE.
Glove Programmable Input Emulator (GlovePIE) provides support for novel input devices in Microsoft Windows and has been extended to support the Wii remote.

Wii PC Scripts provides scripts using GlovePIE that allow the Wii remote to be used with a range of Microsoft Windows games and applications.

 Wii Linux Project .
This project had some initial publicity when it posted a rumour pondering whether the Wii used a modified Linux kernel was reposted on Slashdot and Arstechnica. The author of the rumour later admitted it was a hoax. The web site has not been updated since November 2006 and is currently considered defunct.

 WiiAction Input Library .
The WiiAction input library is a C++ library for getting Nintendo Wii control support in PC applications. Although a demonstration video is available, no source or binaries have been made available due to legal concerns of the author.

 Wiibrew .
This aggregation web site was created as a result of downtime on the WiiLi web site during late 2006 and is presently an infrequently updated aggregation web site. It is also a permanent presence for the #wiidev IRC channel on EFNET.

 WiiLi .
Despite its claimed intention to port Linux to the Wii and some initial fund raising to support development effort, at present WiiLi only provides up to date aggregation of efforts by individual developers to reuse the Wii remote.

WiinRemote.
This project is developing a Microsoft Windows driver for the Wii remote.

 Wiire .
Provides detailed hardware information including images of Wii hardware internals.

<doc id="61175" title="The Thin Man (film)" nonfiltered="225" processed="223" dbindex="1480225">



The Thin Man was the first of six comic detective films starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, a hard-drinking and flirtatious married couple who banter wittily as they easily solve crimes.  Their dog, the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier Asta, played by Skippy, was also a popular character.  

Completed in 1934 and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the film was directed by W.S. Van Dyke from a script by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich; the screenplay was based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett, supposedly based on his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman.  Also appearing in the film were Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Cesar Romero, Porter Hall, Henry Wadsworth, William Henry, Harold Huber and Natalie Moorhead.

The "Thin Man" of the title was actually the lead suspect, but the name was thought by virtually everyone to refer to Nick Charles, and it was used in the titles of the sequels, although no one ever called him that.

This movie was followed by five sequels:
After the Thin Man (1936);
Another Thin Man (1939);
Shadow of the Thin Man (1941);
The Thin Man Goes Home (1944);
Song of the Thin Man (1947);

The 1934 film has been selected for preservation in the United States' National Film Registry.

Radio and television.
The Adventures of the Thin Man radio series, initially starring Les Damon and Claudia Morgan, was broadcast on all four major radio networks during the years 1941 to 1950.

The half-hour weekly TV series, produced by MGM Television, was shown on NBC for two seasons from 1957 1959, starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk as the Charleses. In 1975, Craig Stevens and Jo Ann Pflug starred in the television film Nick and Nora. A 1991 musical, Nick and Nora, starring Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason in the title roles, closed after only nine performances.

Christian Louboutin (born 1963) is a well known French shoe designer. 

Biography.
Christian Louboutin was interested in women's fashion since he was a small child. In 1979, as he was walking alongside the streets of Paris, he noticed a billboard that instructed women tourists not to scratch the wooden floor in front of the Museum of Oceanic Art. 

Louboutin felt personally bothered by this sign, and, as a consequence, he would draw shoes with compressed buckles and with soles. He admits to having spent a lot of time as a teenager drawing these types of shoes in his school notebooks. These shoes would become the base of Louboutin's sales as a designer. 

Later on, Louboutin began attending parties and dance halls in Paris, offering his shoes to women at these events and venues. Most of the ladies rejected his shoes, claiming to have no money.

Louboutin then decided to attend various designing schools, such as Chanel's and Saint Laurent's. 

Louboutin later opened a boutique shop in Paris; his store became distinguished not only because of his clientele, but also because he offered free coffee to shoppers. Such other sellers as American company Neiman Marcus began to sell Louboutin's designs. Louboutin shoes also have a trademark red leather sole, making them instantly recognizable. 

Louboutin, who has been interviewed by fashion reporters such as Jacques Brunel, has seen his celebrity expand to such places like Monte Carlo, Singapore and the United States, among others.  He includes Princess Caroline of Monaco and Catherine Deneuve among his friends.

<doc id="934118" title="Laskarina Bouboulina" nonfiltered="232" processed="230" dbindex="1480232">

Laskarina Bouboulina (Greek:                       , 11 May 1771 - 22 May 1825) was a Greek heroine of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. 

Early life.
Bouboulina was born in a prison in Constantinople. She was the daughter of captain Stavrianos Pinotsis and his wife Skevo. The Ottomans had imprisoned Pinotsis because he had taken part in the failed Orlof Revolution of 1769-1770 against the Ottoman rule. Her father died soon afterwards and the mother and the child returned to the island of Hydra. Four years later, when her mother married Dimitrios Lazarou-Orlof, they moved to the island of Spetses. Bouboulina had eight half-siblings.

She married twice, first to Dimitrios Yiannouzas and later to Dimitrios Bouboulis. D. Bouboulis, was killed in a battle against Algerian pirates in 1811. Bouboulina took over his fortune and trading business and built four ships, including one large warship Agamemnon, at her own expense.

In 1816, the Ottomans tried to confiscate Bouboulina's property because her second husband had fought for the Russians against the Turks in the Turko-Russian wars. Bouboulina sailed to Constantinople to meet Russian ambassador Strogonoff to seek his protection because of her husband's services to the Russians. Strogonoff sent her to safety in Crimea. She also met with the mother of Mahmud II who reputedly convinced her son to leave Bouboulina's property alone. After three months of exile in the Crimea, Bouboulina returned to Spetses.

Support of the independence movement.
Bouboulina joined the Filiki Etaireia, an underground organization that was preparing for revolution against the Ottoman rule, as its only female member. She bought arms and ammunitions at her own expense and brought them secretly to Spetses in her ships, to fight "For the sake of my nation" as she said. Construction of the ship Agamemnon was finished 1820. It was later one of the largest warships in the hands of Greek rebels. Bouboulina bribed Turkish officials to ignore the ship's size. She also organized her own armed troops, composed of men from Spetses. She used most of her fortune to provide food and ammunition for the sailors and soldiers under her command.

On 13 March 1821 Bouboulina raised her own Greek flag, based on the flag of the Comnenus dynasty of Byzantine emperors, on the mast of Agamemnon. On 3 April the people of Spetses revolted and later joined forces with a number of other ships from other Greek islands. Bouboulina sailed with eight ships to Nafplion and began a naval blockade. She led her own troops until the fall of the fort in 13 November 1822. Later she took part in the naval blockade and capture of Monemvasia and Pylos. In the battle at Argos, Bouboulina's son, Yiannis Yiannouzas, died in combat against superior numbers of Ottoman troops.

She arrived in time to witness the fall of Tripolis on 11 September 1821 and met general Theodoros Kolokotronis. Later their children Eleni Boubouli and Panos Kolokotronis were married. During the ensuing extermination of the Ottoman garison, Bouboulina saved most of the female members of the sultan's household.

After independence.
After independence, when the opposing factions erupted into a civil war in 1824, the Greek government arrested Bouboulina because of her family connection to now-imprisoned Kolokotronis; the government also killed her son-in-law. She was eventually exiled back to Spetses. She had used all of her fortune for the war of independence.

Death in feud.
Laskarina Bouboulina was killed in 1825 as the result of a family feud in Spetses. The daughter of a Koutsis family had eloped with Bouboulina's son, Yeorgios Yiannouzas. The father of the girl, Christodoulos Koutsis, and armed members of his family went to Bouboulina's house seeking her. Infuriated, Bouboulina showed up in the balcony of her house to confront them. After her argument with Christodoulos Koutsis, someone shot her in the chest. The killer was not identified. Bouboulina's last words were, "Help me stand, I want to see the sea before I die".

Heritage.
Descendants of Bouboulina gave the ship Agamemnon to the Greek state. It was renamed Spetses and became a Greek navy flagship. It was burned in the naval base of Poros by Andreas Miaoulis during the next Greek civil war in 1831.

On the island of Spetses there is a museum dedicated to Bouboulina called "Bouboulina's Museum", which is housed in the 300 year-old mansion of Bouboulina's second husband, where her descendants still live. A statue of Bouboulina also stands in the harbor in Spetses.

Various streets all over Greece and Cyprus were named after her, with most notable examples of: the Bouboulina's Street near the National Technical University of Athens (the Polytechnion), in central Athens, Bouboulina Street in Piraeus, the largest port-city of Greece and Nicosia, capital of Cyprus.

Cornelius Essex (d. 1680) was an English buccaneer who took part in Captain Bartholomew Sharp's privateering expedition, the "Pacific Adventure", during the late 1670s. 

Although much of his early life is unknown, he is first recorded being brought with his ship, the Great Dolphin, to Port Royal by the HMS Hunter in November 1679 and tried with twenty of his crew for "riotously comporting themselves" as well as charges of looting the plantation of a Major Samuel Jenck's of St. James' parish for which two men were sentenced to death . 

Essex, as did the other Captains, held a commission by the Jamaican government that granted them permission to cut logwood in Honduras and left Port Morant in December 1679 with Captain John Coxon, Robert Allison, Thomas Mackett, Jean Rose and a Captain Bournano and rendezvoused at the Isles of Pines near eastern Panama shortly after. 

Following the election of Coxon as head of the party, the privateers traced the old route Sir Henry Morgan had taken in his raid on Portobello in 1668. After anchoring at a deserted cay, he was one of the privateers that participated in the overland assault on the Spanish stronghold and was among thirty others killed in a surprise attack against the garrison.

Bucket Racing is a discipline of motorcycle sport, which is very popular in Australia and New Zealand due to the low cost of competing. 

Origins.
Bucket racing was originally started by motorcycling enthusiasts in New Zealand, around 1980. It quickly became very popular, and spread to Australia by 1988. The name derives from the slang phrase `bucket of shit', or similar Bowdlerised terms; rather than the usual finely-tuned racing machines that traditionally graced racing circuits, these bikes were often recycled ex-road machines that had been crashed or fallen into disrepair.

The original idea was to take a low powered commuter motorcycle with a maximum capacity of 150cc and remove the entire road going gear, thus creating absolutely the cheapest form of motorcycle racing in the country.

And so began one of the most enduring forms of motorcycle racing that New South Wales and Australia has seen in the post war period. At its height in the mid 90 s, NSW race meetings enjoyed up to 60 competitors at every meeting, divided into Amateur and Pro classes   essentially, junior and senior riders based on experience and ability.

As a form of inexpensive racing the class has seen participation from teenagers to retirees, attracted to the sport by its low cost and accessibility. Bikes prepared for bucket racing still sell for as little as $500 still making it the cheapest form of amateur racing available to anyone who can ride a bike

Bucket Racing Develops.
A bucket racing matured it bred a group of  Garagists , enthusiasts who developed their racing bikes into highly crafted and very speedy racing machines. The addition of racing seats, fiberglass fairings, rear set footrests and gear changes and racing handlebars made some these machines replicas of more modern production racing machines

In addition, home developers engineered the motors of these machines and dramatically increased power outputs from the normal road going power of around 8 12 horse power to outputs often in excess of 20 horse power. It is a tribute to home developers that they were able to create motors that produced power outputs that are directly proportional to factory made GP production race machines

Ansa or Ansia was the wife of Desiderius, King of the Lombards. She was probably a Lombard, the daughter of Verissimo and sister of Arechis and Donnolo. 

In or around 753, she founded the monastery of S. Michele and S. Pietro at Brescia. It later merged with that of S. Salvatore and S. Maria. After 759, she appeared frequently in Desiderius' diplomas and was probably the architect of his religious policy. 

On 5 June 774, she was presented along with her husband to Charlemagne, who had conquered Pavia. She was sent with her husband and an unnamed daughter, probably Gerperga, to Liège or Corbie, but allowed to return in 775. Paul the Deacon wrote an Epitaphium Ansae reginae praising her politics, her piety, and her beauty: coniunx pulcherrima, "most beautiful wife". 

Her children with Desiderius were:
Anselperga (or Anselberga), abbess of San Salvatore ;
Adelperga (or Adelberga), married Arechis II of Benevento ;
Liutperga (also Liutpirc or Liutberga), married Tassilo III of Bavaria ;
Gerperga (or Gerberga), married Charlemagne in 768, divorced in 771 ;
Adelchis (or Adalgis), patrician in Constantinople;

The New Bill Cosby Show was a variety television series aired in the United States by CBS as part of its 1972-73 lineup.

The New Bill Cosby Show was an attempt to exploit the widespread popularity of Bill Cosby, who had previously starred in an eponymous sitcom and the drama (with comedic undertones) I Spy and who had been responsible for several of the best-selling comedy albums of the 1960s.  Cosby's supporting cast was biracial, highlighted by Foster Brooks of "funny-drunk" routine fame and also included performer Lola Falana, who additionally served as the show's announcer, and other persons previously best known as comedy writers, including Ronny Graham and Pat McCormick.  Quincy Jones' orchestra provided the music.  Ongoing sketches included "The Wife of the Week" and the adventures of "The Dude", a man who was so impossibly cool that nothing whatever could faze him or cause him in any way to lose his composure or coolness.

Palaka (or 'Kpalaga') is a central Senufo language spoken by approximately 8 000 people (1995 SIL) in northern Côte d'Ivoire. It is bordered to the south by Djimini, a southern Senufo language, and to the west by Nyarafolo, another Senufo language. North and east of the Palaka area live Dioula people. 

Palaka constitutes a separate branch of the Senufo languages on its own, being rather different from them in morphology and phonology. It has been tentatively linked to Nafaanra language, an isolated Senufo language spoken in Ghana. Palaka has been separated from the other Senufo languages at least since the fourteenth century AD.

<doc id="7278952" title="William Aspdin" nonfiltered="240" processed="238" dbindex="1480240">
William Aspdin (23 September 1815   1864) was an English cement manufacturer, and a pioneer of the Portland cement industry.

Biography.
He was born in Leeds.  His father, Joseph obtained a patent for "Portland cement" in 1824 and William joined his father's cement manufacturing firm in 1829.  His father's product was a fast-setting material usable only in mortars and stuccos.  During the next ten years, William evidently noticed that a significantly different product, with much wider applications, could be made by modifying the cement's formulation.  By increasing the limestone content in the mixture, and burning it much harder, a slow-setting, high-strength product suitable for use in concrete could be obtained.  This product was substantially more expensive to make, in terms of cost of extra limestone, cost of extra fuel, and difficult grinding of the hard clinker.  It is unclear whether William actually made this product at his father's plant, but in 1841 he left the firm after major disagreements with his father.

He immediately set up a manufacturing plant at Northfleet, Kent, and was soon making a cement that caused a sensation among users in London.  Although this product, referred to today as "modern" Portland cement, was entirely different mineralogically from that of his father, William did not take out a patent, or give it a new name.  Apparently, he was aware of the competence of a number of competing manufacturers near to his North Kent plant, and decided that any patent would quickly be infringed by all his rivals.  He therefore decided to claim that the product was covered by his father's patent, and clothed the details of his methods in secrecy.  Famously, he would emerge from his office when each newly-loaded kiln was ready for firing, and scatter in handfuls of brightly-coloured crystals over the rawmix, in order to give the impression that the special properties of his product were the result of an unidentified "magic ingredient".  This strategy kept competition at bay for two years, after which I C Johnson succeeded in matching the product at J B White & Co's nearby Swanscombe plant.  See the link for Johnson's own account of this.

He contracted several partnerships in order to finance his operations.  He sold out his share of the Northfleet plant in 1852, and set up in Gateshead, County Durham.  In 1857, he sold out again, and moved to Germany.  From 1860, he set up cement plants at Altona and Lagerdorf, these being the first plants to make modern Portland cement outside the UK.  He died at Itzehoe near Hamburg.

Like his father, William had no chemical knowledge, and his innovations were purely the result of luck.  His contribution (although he was unaware of it) was to make the first cement containing alite as an active ingredient.  His finances were chaotic, and he was bankrupt at least twice.  At each relocation, he was pursued by angry creditors.  However, he always took sufficient cash from his businesses to live comfortably, and constructed a substantial concrete mansion - Portland Hall - in Gravesend, Kent.

Fan Chan (Thai:       , English: My Girl) is a 2003 Thai romantic comedy film offering a nostalgic look back at the childhood friendship of a boy and girl growing up in a small town in Thailand in the 1980s. It was the debut film by six young screenwriter-directors, Vitcha Gojiew, Songyos Sugmakanan, Nithiwat Tharathorn, Witthaya Thongyooyong, Anusorn Trisirikasem and Komgrit Triwimol. With a soundtrack that featured Thai pop music of the era, Fan Chan was the top domestic film at the Thailand box office in 2003, earning 140 million baht.

Plot.

Jeab, a young man working in Bangkok, receives word that his best friend from childhood, Noi-Naa is to be married. While driving back to his hometown, the memories of his friendship with her come flooding back, and their story is told in a flashback.

Jeab and Noi-Naa live in a small city. Their fathers are rival barbers, with shops situated next to each other, with only a sweet shop to separate them. Jeab's father favors efficiency and uses an electric trimmer. Noi-Naa's father, meanwhile, has a more contemplative, artistic approach, and uses scissors. Jeab notes that the results of both methods seem to be the same.


The school holiday is ended. Jeab is notorious for oversleeping, so that each day he misses the school bus and must be driven part way by his father on a motorcycle. By taking a shortcut, Jeab and his father are able to catch up to the bus, but only just in time.

On the bus, other boys are introduced. Their ringleader is an overweight bully named Jack. On the bus, the children talk about what they are going to do after school. The boys decide they will play Chinese fantasy characters, while the girls plan to play "house".

Because Jeab must cross a busy street to play with the boys, and he fears getting hit by a car, he stays to play with the girls, which makes him the target of much taunting by Jack and the other boys.

Then, one day, Jack and his friends are playing soccer against a rival neighborhood gang. They are one player short. Jeab happens to be hanging around, and he's asked to join the game, proving his abilities.

He earns the trust of Jack's gang, and passes various tests in order to join. But the one thing he must do is sever his ties to Noi-Naa. Jeab does so, quite literally, by cutting a rubber-band jump rope, which Noi-Naa is skilled at playing with.

From that moment on, Noi-Naa refuses to talk to Jeab. Then, one day, Jeab gets word that Noi-Naa is moving away. And, of course, on the day she is to leave, Jeab oversleeps and misses the chance to say his final goodbye to Noi-Naa. Jeab then gets Jack and his friends to commandeer a delivery motorcycle and pursue Noi-Naa and her family in their moving truck. But the motorcycle breaks down, and the truck rolls out of sight. Jeab is to never see Noi-Naa again ... until her wedding.

Harridge Pike is a hill situated within the boundaries of Stalybridge, Greater Manchester just outside the Peak District National Park. Its western flank rises from the valley of the River Tame to a height of 395 metres. To the east, the pike falls away more gradually to Swineshaw Moor which, above the Swineshaw reservoirs rises to Irontongue Hill, a broad shoulder of Hoarstone Edge. Since 2004, the moorland in the area of the pike has been classed as access land. From the summit of Harridge Pike, a view is afforded of the middle section of the Tame valley and the whole of the town of Stalybridge, large swathes of the eastern suburbs of Manchester and beyond to Manchester city centre, where  its town hall is visible. On exceptionally clear days the mountains of Snowdonia are visible.

The Lady Nelson was a vessel used in the exploration of the coast of Australia in the early years of the 19th century.  

Description.


The Lady Nelson was named in honour of the wife of Horatio Nelson, England's naval hero. She was built in Deptford, England in 1799 and purchased by the Royal Navy in 1800.

She was a Brig designed especially for inshore exploration, with a draught of only 6', and three sliding keels. This unusual feature was originally conceived by naval architect John Schank.

Her length was 52'6", her tonnage 60 tonnes, and she was originally armed with 2 brass carriage guns. Her crew consisted of fifteen men: the commander, two mates, and twelve seamen.

She was fitted out with a further four guns and provisions for 9 months and sent to Australia under the command of Lieutenant James Grant.

Exploration of the Victorian coast.
The Lady Nelson reached the western coast of Victoria, Australia in December 1800, and was subsequently the first vessel to pass through Bass Strait on her way to Sydney. Grant named Cape Schanck, Mount Gambier, Northumberland Cape, Cape Banks, Cape Bridgewater, Mount Schank, Lady Julia Percy Island, Portland Bay, Point Danger and Cape Otway along the southern coast.  After arriving in Sydney, she soon turned around to further explore the south coast, now with John Murray aboard as first mate, and surveyed as far as Westernport Bay. However, her most famous southern voyage was in early 1802 when John Murray, having been given command of the Lady Nelson, discovered the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. On the same voyage he also surveyed King Island and the Kent Group.

Association with Matthew Flinders.
The Lady Nelson is also associated with Matthew Flinders. In 1803 the Lady Nelson was intended to accompany Flinders' other survey ship, the Investigator, in surveying the coast north of Sydney. However, she accompanied the Investigator only as far as Cumberland Island when Flinders decided she was unseaworthy and sent her back.

The Loss of the Lady Nelson to Privateers.
On September 22nd 1825, The Sydney Gazette reported: 'The Lady Nelson, brig, has been most unfortunately cut off at Timor by Malay privateers and all the crew sacrificed, except the Captain.   The little 60 ton ship contributed more to the exploration and settlement than any other.   She served in the colony for a quarter of a century'.

Modern replica.
A modern replica of the Lady Nelson was built in  c. 1988 and is based in Tasmania and operates as a sail training vessel after a recent 4-month refurbishment.

<doc id="335665" title="History of Poland (1569?1795)" nonfiltered="246" processed="244" dbindex="1480246">



The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Diet in 1505 transferred all legislative power from the king to the Diet. This event marked the beginning of the period known as "Nobles' Democracy" or "Nobles' Commonwealth" (Rzeczpospolita szlachecka) when the state was ruled by the "free and equal" Polish nobility (szlachta). The Lublin Union of 1569 constituted the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as an influential player in European politics and a vital cultural entity. By the 18th century the nobles' democracy gradually declined into anarchy, making the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign influence. Eventually the country was partitioned by its neighbors and erased from the map in 1795.

 Founding of The Elective Monarchy.

The death of Sigismund II Augustus in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum period during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system. The lower nobility was now included in the selection process, and the power of the monarch was further circumscribed in favor of the expanded noble class. Each king had to sign the so called Henrician Articles, which were the basis of the political system of Poland, and pacta conventa which were various personal obligations of the chosen king. From that point, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and constantly supervised by a group of senators. Once the Jagiellons disappeared from the scene, the fragile equilibrium of the Commonwealth government began to go awry. The constitutional reforms made the monarchy electoral in fact as well as name. As more and more power went to the noble electors, it also eroded from the government's center.



In its periodic opportunities to fill the throne, the szlachta exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who would not found another strong dynasty.  This policy produced monarchs who were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the nobility. Furthermore, aside from notable exceptions such as the able Transylvanian Stefan Batory (1576-1586), the kings of alien origin were inclined to subordinate the interests of the Commonwealth to those of their own country and ruling house.

Henryk II Walezy (1572 1573).

Henry II Walezy was elected a king of the Commonwealth in 1572, but shortly after, at the death of his brother Charles IX, he fled Poland and returned to France to be crowned as Henry III of France.

Stefan Batory (1576 1586). 

Poland defeated Russia's Ivan the Terrible and retrieved most of the lost provinces, including Livland. At the end of his reign, Poland ruled two main Baltic sea ports: Gda sk controlling the Vistula river trade and Riga controlling Western Dvina trade. Both cities were among the largest in the country.


During the Livonian War (1558 1582), between Ivan the Terrible of Russia and Stefan Batory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city was besieged by Polish forces. Poland failed to capture the city, but Batory, with his chancellor Jan Zamojski, led the Polish army in a brilliant decisive campaign and forced Russia to return other territories and gained Livonia and Polock.  In 1582 the war ended with Commonwealth victory with the peace treaty in Jam Zapolski.

Stefan Bathory planned a Christian alliance against the Islamic Ottomans.  He proposed an anti-Ottoman alliance with Russia, which he considered a necessary step for his anti-Ottoman crusade. However, Russia was on the way to the Time of Troubles so he could not find a partner there. When Stefan Bathory died, there was a one year interregnum.  Emperor Mathias's brother Maximilian III tried to claim title of King of Poland, but was defeated at Byczyna in 1588 and Sigismund III Vasa followed Stefan Bathory's reign.

House of Vasa.
Zygmunt III Waza (1587 1632).
 
The first few years of Sigismund's reign, until 1598 saw Poland and Sweden united in a personal union that made the Baltic sea an internal lake (the Polish-Swedish union). However, the rebellion in Sweden started the chain of events that would involve Commonwealth in more than a century of warfare with Sweden.

In the end, Sigismund III Waza failed to strengthen the Commonwealth nor to solve its internal problems; instead he concentrated on a futile attempt to regain his former Swedish throne.

Polish-Sweden-Muscovy Wars.


Sigismund desire to reclaim the throne drove Sigismund into prolonged military adventures waged against his native Sweden under Charles IX and later also Russia. In 1598 Sigismund tried to defeat Charles with a mixed army from Sweden and Poland but was defeated in the battle of Stångebro. The war continued, punctuated by many ceasefires and broken peace treaties. On occasion, these campaigns brought Poland to a nearly complete conquest of Russia and the Baltic coast during the Time of Troubles and False Dimitris, had it not been for the military burden imposed by the ongoing rivalry on multiple borders: the Ottoman Empire, the Swedes and the Russians.

The southern wars.


Commonwealth-Ottomans relations were never too warm, as the Commonwealth viewed itself as the 'bulwark of the Christendom' and together with Habsburgs and Republic of Venice was the thorn in the Ottoman plans of European conquest. Since the second half of the 16th century, Polish-Ottomans relations, never too friendly, were further worsened by the escalation of Cossacks-Tatars border warfare, which turned the entire border region between the Commonwealth and Ottoman Empire into a semi-permanent warzone. 

In the 1595, magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth intervened in the affairs of Moldavia. This would start a series of conflicts that would soon spread to Transylvania, Wallachia and Hungary, when the Commonwealth forces clashed with the forces backed by Ottoman Empire and occasionally Habsburgs, all competing for the domination over that region. 

With the Commonwealth engaged on its northern and eastern borders with near constant conflicts against Sweden and Muscovy, its armies were spread thin. Finally, the southern wars culminated in the Polish defeat at the battle of Cecora in 1620. Eventually the Commonwealth was forced to renounce all claims to Moldavia, Transylvania, Wallachia and Hungary.

Religious and social tensions.

The population of Poland-Lithuania was neither overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nor Polish. This circumstance resulted from the federation with Lithuania, where ethnic Poles were a distinct minority. In those days, to be Polish was much less an indication of ethnicity than of rank; it was a designation largely reserved for the landed noble class, which included members of Polish and non-Polish origin alike. Generally speaking, the ethnically non-Polish noble families of Lithuania adopted the Polish language and culture. As a result, in the eastern territories of the kingdom a Polish aristocracy dominated over a peasantry whose great majority was neither Polish nor Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge colonization efforts to Ukraine, which heightened tensions between peasants, Jews and nobles. The tensions were aggravated by the conflicts between Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches following the Union of Brest and by several Cossack uprisings. On the West and North, cities had big German minorities, often of reformed belief.

W adys aw IV Waza (1632-1648).


Wladislaw tried to achieve many military goals, including conquest of Russia, Sweden and Turkey. His reign is that of many small victories, few of them bringing anything worthwhile to the Commonwealth. For a time, he was elected a tsar, but never had any control over Russian territories. In the end, like his father, he failed to strengthen the Commonwealth or prevent the crippling events of The Deluge or Chmielnicki Rebellion, that devastated the Commonwealth in 1648.

Jan Kazimierz Vasa (1648 1668).

The reign of the last of Vasas in the Commonwealth would be dominated by the culmination in the war with Sweden, groundwork for which was laid down by the two previous Vasa kings of the Commonwealth.

In 1660 Jan Kazimierz would be forced to renounce his claims to the Swedish throne and acknowledge Swedish sovereignty over Livonia and city of Riga. He abdicated on 16 September 1668 and returned to France where he joined the Jesuit order and became an ordinary monk. He died in 1672.

Chmielnicki Uprising, 1648-1654.


This largest  of all Cossacks rebellions, led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, proved disastrous for the Commonwealth. In the end, Commonwealth not only lost parts of its territory to Russia, but was weakened at the moment of invasion by Sweden.

The Deluge, (1648-1667).

Although Poland-Lithuania escaped the ravages of the Thirty Years' War, which ended in 1648, the ensuing two decades subjected the country to one of its severest trials. This colorful but ruinous interval, the stuff of legend and the popular historical novels of Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz, became known as the potop, or deluge, for the magnitude and suddenness of its hardships. The emergency began with an uprising of Cossacks in Ukraine that culminated in a reassertion of an independent Cossack nation centered in Kyiv, in spite of Warsaw's efforts to subdue it by force. After the Cossacks concluded the Treaty of Pereyaslav with Russia, prolonged and increasing Russian intervention began in the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories. Taking advantage of Poland's preoccupation and weakness, Charles X of Sweden rapidly overran much of the remaining territory of the Commonwealth in the same year. Pushed to the brink of dissolution, Poland-Lithuania rallied to recover most of its losses from the Swedes. In exchange for breaking the alliance with Sweden, the ruler of Ducal Prussia was released from his vassalage and became a de facto independent sovereign, while much of the Polish Protestant nobility went over to the side of the Swedes. Swedish brutality, and especially the ineffectual siege of Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa in winter of 1655-1656, raised widespread revolts against Charles, whom a part of Polish nobles had recognized as their ruler in the meantime. Under hetman Stefan Czarniecki, the Poles and Lithuanians had driven the Swedes from their territory by 1657.  

Further complicated by dissenting nobles and wars with the Ottoman Turks, the thirteen-year struggle over control of Ukraine ended in the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667. Although Russians had been ousted from Wilno and Lwow by 1662, the Tsar gained eastern Ukraine in the peace treaty.

Despite the improbable survival of the Commonwealth in the face of the potop, one of the most dramatic instances of the Poles' knack for prevailing in adversity, the episode inflicted irremediable damage and contributed heavily to the ultimate demise of the state. When Jan II Kazimierz abdicated in 1668, the population of the Commonwealth had been nearly halved by war and disease. War had destroyed the economic base of the cities and raised a religious fervor that ended Poland's policy of religious tolerance. Henceforth, the Commonwealth would be on the strategic defensive facing hostile neighbors. Not until the Polish-Soviet War of the early 20th century would Poland compete with Russia as a military equal.

Commonwealth after the Deluge.

In the Treaty of Oliwa in 1660, John II of Poland finally renounced his claims to the Swedish Crown, which ended the feud between Sweden and the Commonwealth and the accompanying string of wars between those countries (War against Sigismund (1598-1599), Polish-Swedish War (1600-1629) and the Northern Wars (1655-1660)).

After the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667 and the Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686, the Commonwealth lost left-bank Ukraine to Russia.

Polish culture and the Greek Catholic Church gradually advanced and by the 18th century, the population of Ducal Prussia was a mixture of Catholics and Protestants and used both the German and Polish languages. The rest of Poland and most of Lithuania remained firmly Roman Catholic, while Ukraine and some parts of Lithuania (i.e., Belarus) were Greek Orthodox. The society was split into a polonized upper stratum and peasants of other nationalities.

Decay of the Commonwealth.

During the 18th century the Polish crown itself became
subject to the manipulations of Russia, Sweden, the Kingdom of Prussia, France and Austria. Poland's weakness was exacerbated by an unworkable constitution which allowed each noble or gentry representative in the Sejm to use his vetoing power to stop further parliamentary proceedings for the given session. This greatly weakened the central authority of Poland and paved the way for its destruction.

Most accounts of Polish history show the two centuries after the end of the Jagiellon dynasty as a time of decline leading to foreign domination. 

Before another hundred years have elapsed, Poland-Lithuania had virtually ceased to function as a coherent and genuinely independent state. The commonwealth's last martial triumph occurred in 1683 when King Jan Sobieski drove the Turks from the gates of Vienna with a heavy cavalry charge. Poland's important role in aiding the European alliance to roll back the Ottoman Empire was rewarded with some territory in Podole by the Treaty of Karlowicz (1699). Nonetheless, this isolated success did little to mask the internal weakness and paralysis of the Polish-Lithuanian political system. For the next quarter century, Poland was often a pawn in Russia's campaigns against other powers.  Augustus II of Saxony, who succeeded Jan Sobieski, involved Poland in Peter the Great's war with Sweden, incurring another round of occupation and devastation by the Swedes between 1704 and 1710.

In the eighteenth century, the powers of the monarchy and the central administration became purely formal. Kings were denied permission to provide for the elementary requirements of defense and finance, and aristocratic clans made treaties directly with foreign sovereigns.  Attempts at reform were stymied by the determination of the szlachta to preserve their "golden freedoms" as well as the liberum veto. Because of the chaos sown by the veto provision, under Augustus III (1733-63) only one of thirteen Sejm sessions ran to an orderly adjournment.

Unlike Spain and Sweden, great powers that were allowed to settle peacefully into secondary status at the periphery of Europe at the end of their time of glory, Poland endured its decline at the strategic crossroads of the continent.  Lacking central leadership and impotent in foreign relations, Poland-Lithuania became a chattel of the ambitious kingdoms that surrounded it, an immense but feeble buffer state. During the reign of Peter the Great (1682-1725), the commonwealth fell under the dominance of Russia, and by the middle of the eighteenth century Poland-Lithuania had been made a virtual protectorate of its eastern neighbor, retaining only the theoretical right to self-rule.

The Polish succession war was fought from 1733-1735.

Michael Korybut Wisniowiecki (King 1669 1673).


Following the abdication of King Jan Kazimierz Vasa and the end of The Deluge, the Polish nobility (szlachta) elected Michael as king, believing he would further the interests of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the first monarch of Polish origin since the last of Jagiellonian Dynasty, Sigismund II Augustus, died in 1572. Michael was a son of a successful but controversial military commander Jeremi Micha  Wi niowiecki, known for his actions during the Chmielnicki Uprising led by Bohdan Chmielnicki.

His reign was less than successful, and the nobility was not satisfied with the House of Vasa's dynastic policies. Despite his fathers military fame Michael lost a war against the Ottoman Empire, with Turks occupying Podolia. He was unable to cope with his responsibilities and with the different quarreling factions within Poland.

John III Sobieski (King 1674 1696).


John III Sobieski most famous achievement was to deal crushing defeat to the Ottoman Empire in 1683 at the Battle of Vienna, which marked the final turning point in a 250-year struggle between the forces of Christian Europe and the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Over the 16 years following the battle (the so-called Great Turkish War), the Turks would be permanently driven south of the Danube River, never to threaten central Europe again.

Augustus II the Strong (Wettin) (King 1697 1706, 1709 1733).
Augustus II the Strong, also known as Frederick Augustus I, Prince-Elector of Saxony, was an over-ambitious ruler. He defeated his biggest rival, François Louis, Prince of Conti, supported by France, and Sobieski's son, Jakub. To ensure his success for the crown of Poland he decided to convert to Roman Catholicism from Lutheranism. Augustus hoped to make the Polish throne hereditary within his family, and to use his resources as Elector of Saxony to impose some order on the chaotic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, he was soon distracted from his internal reform projects by the possibility of external conquest. He involved the Commonwealth in the disastrous Great Northern War. His attempts of internal reforms and strengthening the royal power came to nothing, but his mistakes allowed Russian Empire to strengthen its influence over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Stanislaw Leszczynski (King 1706 1709, 1733 1736).
Seen as a puppet of Sweden, Leszczynski ruled in times of turmoil, and was soon cut off from the throne. He emerged in the election of 1733, supported by France, but after the military intervention of the Russian army, from which he was defending himself in Gda sk, he was forced to leave the country once again, ruling successfully in Lorraine.

August III Wettin (King 1733 1763).
Also Elector of Saxony (as Frederick Augustus II), August II, after his father's death inherited Saxony and was elected king of Poland with support of Russian and Austrian troops. August II was disinterested in the affairs of his Polish dominion, which he viewed mostly as a source of funds and resources for strengthening his power in Saxony. During his 30 year-reign, he spent less than 3 years in Poland. He delegated most of his powers and responsibilities to count Heinrich Bruhl. 30 years of August II disinterested reign festered the political anarchy and further weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while neighboring Prussia, Austria and Russia finalized plans for the partitions of Poland.

The Three Partitions, (1764-1795).

During the reign of Empress Catherine the Great (1762-1796), Russia intensified its manipulation in Polish affairs. The Kingdom of Prussia and Austria, the other powers surrounding the republic, also took advantage of internal religious and political bickering to divide up the country in three partition stages. After two partitions, the third one in 1795 eventually wiped Poland-Lithuania from the map of Europe. 

Stanis aw August Poniatowski (King 1764 1795).
First Partition.

In 1764 Catherine dictated the election of her former favorite, Stanis aw August Poniatowski, as king of Poland-Lithuania. Confounding expectations that he would be an obedient servant of his mistress, Stanislaw August encouraged the modernization of his realm's ramshackle political system and achieved a temporary moratorium on use of the individual veto in the Sejm (1764-1766). This turnabout threatened to renew the strength of the monarchy and brought displeasure in the foreign capitals that preferred an inert, pliable Poland. Catherine, being among the most displeased by Poniatowski's independence, encouraged religious dissension in Poland-Lithuania's substantial Eastern Orthodox population, which earlier in the eighteenth century had lost the rights enjoyed during the Jagiellon Dynasty.

Under heavy Russian pressure, the Sejm introduced Orthodox and Protestant  equality in 1767. Through the Polish nobles that Russia controlled and Russian Minister to Warsaw Prince Nikolai Repnin, Czarina Catherine the Great forced a constitution, which undid the reforms of 1764 under Stanislaw II, on Poland in 1767.  The liberum veto and all the old abuses of the last 1 1/4 centuries were guaranteed as unalterable parts of this new constitution. 
Poland was compelled to sign Treaty of Guarantee with Russia, where Catharina was imposed as protector of Polish political system. Since then Poland has becomed de facto a Russian protectorate. Real power in Rzeczpospolita have Russian ambassadors. Polish king becomed only an executor of their will.
This action provoked a Catholic uprising by the Confederation of Bar, a league of Polish nobles that fought with Russian intervention until 1772 to revoke Catherine's mandate.

The defeat of the Confederation of Bar again left Poland exposed to the ambitions of its neighbors. Although Catherine initially opposed partition, Frederick the Great of Prussia profited from Austria's threatening military position to the southwest by pressing a long-standing proposal to carve territory from the commonwealth.  Catherine, persuaded that Russia did not have the resources to continue its unilateral domination of Poland, agreed. In 1772 Russia, Prussia, and Austria forced terms of partition upon the helpless commonwealth under the pretext of restoring order in the anarchic conditions of the country.

National Revival.
The first partition in 1772 did not directly threaten the stability of Poland-Lithuania. Poland still retained extensive territory that included the Polish heartlands. In fact, the shock of the annexations made clear the dangers of decay in government institutions, creating a body of opinion favorable to reform along the lines of the European Enlightenment. King Stanislaw August supported the progressive elements in the government and promoted the ideas of foreign political figures such as Edmund Burke and George Washington. At the same time, Polish intellectuals discussed Enlightenment philosophers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. During the period of Polish Enlightenment, the concept of democratic institutions for all classes was accepted in Polish society. Education reform included establishment of the first ministry of education in Europe. Taxation and the army underwent thorough reform, and government again was centralized in the Permanent Council. Landholders emancipated large numbers of
peasants, although there was no official government decree. Polish cities, in decline for many decades, were revived by the influence of the Industrial Revolution, especially in mining and textiles.

Stanislaw August's process of renovation reached its climax on May 3, 1791, when, after three years of intense debate, the "Four Years' Sejm" produced what is claimed as Europe's first modern codified constitution. Conceived in the liberal spirit of the contemporaneous document in the United States, the constitution recast Poland-Lithuania as a hereditary monarchy and abolished many of the eccentricities and antiquated features of the old system. The new constitution abolished the individual veto in parliament; provided a separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government; and established "people's sovereignty" (for the noble and bourgeois classes). Although never fully implemented, the Constitution of May 3 gained an honored position in the Polish political heritage; tradition marks the anniversary of its passage as the country's most important civic holiday.

Destruction of Poland-Lithuania.

Passage of the constitution alarmed nobles who would lose considerable stature under the new order. In autocratic states such as Russia, the democratic ideals of the constitution also threatened the existing order, and the prospect of Polish recovery threatened to end domination of Polish affairs by its neighbors. In 1792 domestic and foreign reactionaries combined to end the democratization process.  Polish conservative factions formed the Confederation of Targowica and appealed for Russian assistance in restoring the status quo. Catherine gladly used this opportunity; enlisting Prussian support, she invaded Poland under the pretext of defending Poland's ancient liberties. The irresolute Stanislaw August capitulated, defecting to the Targowica faction.  Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France, Russia and Prussia abrogated the Constitution of 3 May, carried out a second partition of Poland in 1793, and placed the remainder of the country under
occupation by Russian troops.

The second partition was far more injurious than the first. Russia received a vast area of eastern Poland, extending southward from its gains in the first partition nearly to the Black Sea. To the west, Prussia received an area known as South Prussia, nearly twice the size of its first-partition gains along the Baltic, as well as the port of Gda sk. Thus, Poland's neighbors reduced the commonwealth to a rump state and plainly signaled their designs to abolish it altogether at their convenience.

In a gesture of defiance, a general Polish revolt broke out in 1794 under the leadership of Tadeusz Kosciuszko (Kosciuszko Uprising), a military officer who had rendered notable service in the American Revolution. Kosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of Russian General Alexander Suvorov. In the wake of the insurrection of 1794, Russia, Prussia, and Austria carried out the third and final partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1795, erasing the Commonwealth of Two Nations from the map and pledging never to let it return.

Much of Europe condemned the dismemberment as an international crime without
historical parallel. Amid the distractions of the French Revolution and its
attendant wars, however, no state actively opposed the annexations. In the long
term, the dissolution of Poland-Lithuania upset the traditional European

Countersteering is the name given to the counter-intuitive technique used by cyclists and motorcyclists to turn corners. It is the only way a rider can cause a single-track vehicle at speed to turn.

It is important to distinguish between countersteering as a physical phenomenon and countersteering as a rider technique for initiating a turn (the usual interpretation of the term). The physical phenomenon always occurs, because there is no other way to cause the bike and rider to lean short of some outside influence such as an opportune side wind, although at low speeds it can be lost or hidden in the minute corrections made to maintain balance. On the other hand, the technique of applying pressure to the handlebars to initiate a turn is not always necessary, since, on a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), turning can also be initiated by shifting body weight. Documented physical experimentation shows that on heavy bikes (many motorcycles) shifting body weight is ineffective at initiating turns.

How it works.
When riding a bicycle or a motorcycle, countersteering is a method of initiating a turn by a small, momentary turn of the front wheel, usually via the handlebars, in the opposite (counter) direction. While necessary at all speeds, the need to countersteer becomes more noticeable as speed increases.

A bike can negotiate a curve only when it leans towards the inside of the turn, at an angle appropriate for the velocity and the sharpness of the turn. Otherwise centrifugal force will tip the bike and rider over towards the outside of the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn.

If a rider wants to turn to the right, he first throws the bike off balance by momentarily pointing the front wheel slightly to the left. The center of mass of the bike plus rider will continue in a straight line, but the contact patches of the tires move to the left with respect to this straight line. As gravity then tips the bike over to the right, the front wheel is steered into the curve, and the curve is negotiated with the proper inward lean. This process usually requires little physical effort, because the geometry of the steering system of most bikes is designed in such a way that the front wheel has a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean.

At low speeds countersteering is equally necessary, but the countersteering is then so subtle that it drowns in the continuous corrections that are made in balancing the bike.

Once in a turn, countersteering is again required to make changes to its shape. The only way to decrease the radius at the same speed is to increase the lean angle, and the only way to increase the lean angle, is again to momentarily steer opposite to the direction of the curve. To the untrained, this can be extremely counter-intuitive.

To exit a turn, countersteer by momentarily steering further in the direction of the turn. This tilts the bike back upright.

Countersteering is indispensable for bike steering. Most people are not consciously aware that they employ countersteering when riding their bike. Their body has learned to include the well timed countersteering jolt. They may have learned to do so while learning to ride a bicycle in childhood. Often people simply assume that the steering of a bike is just like the steering of a car. Their subconscious balance skills know better.

As is well-known in bicycle racing, the countersteering phenomenon becomes evident when there is an obstacle preventing the wheel from countersteering, e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb. In these situations, the only way to initiate a turn away from the obstacle is to come into contact with it, that is, turn towards the wheel or curb in order to avoid crashing into it. Lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races. 

Motorcycles.
Even more so than on a bicycle, mastering the technique of countersteering is essential for safe motorcycle riding, and as a result is a large part of the safe riding courses run by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.  At the higher speeds that motorcycles commonly travel at, it becomes increasingly impractical to steer by taking advantage of the minute and random corrections needed to maintain balance.

Much of the art of motorcycle cornering is learning how to effectively "push" the grips into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the turn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that the handlebars must be deliberately pressed away on that side instead of being pulled.  Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.

The Hive is an original Star Wars novella written by Steven Barnes.  It is a prequel novel occurring 21 years before the Battle of Yavin (21 BBY).

Summary.

The Hive follows the story of Obi-Wan Kenobi as he is dispatched as a Republic envoy to the Outer Rim planet Ord Cestus, where he must strive to halt the sale of potentially deadly  bio-droids  to the Confederacy.  Despite the efforts of Obi-Wan, this mission quickly turns from diplomatic to dangerous.  This planet which was at one time self contained, has long since been co-opted by unscrupulous offworlders, whose plunder of a vital natural resource has enabled the rise of a powerful corporation that controls the economy.  Even the native population known as the X Ting have been reduced to mere second class citizens in their own society.

Obi-Wan Kenobi brings with him the knowledge of a legal technicality that would allow the X'Ting to retake control of their planet.  Circumstances within the X'Ting civilization are less than desirable in which to mount such a revival.  This once tightly knit race has splintered into battling factions as a result of a devastating plague, which wiped out many of the X'Ting rulers.  Reunification can only come with the rise of new royals, whom all X Ting are bound by blood to serve. But the eggs that will spawn those sovereigns lie out of reach, secured in a secret chamber and booby-trapped by those whose knowledge died with them in the plague.  Obi-Wan Kenobi and his X'Ting guide, Jesson Di Blinth travel down into the sealed egg chamber in an attempt to retrieve the last remaining royal eggs.  They face many trials along the way, including a question and answer session for the final test.  The questions are presented by a machine that holds the eggs, and threatens vaporization of them if answered incorrectly.  Jesson is the only one who can complete this task because he is X'Ting, and the test seeks to determine one's knowledge of X'Ting history.  Unfortunately, Jesson answers the questions to the best of his knowledge but all are incorrect.  The machine starts the vaporization process, and all Obi-Wan and Jesson can do is sit astonished as the last hope for X'Ting reunification is destroyed.  Unbeknownst to them, this was in fact the final test, to view the reaction of Jesson to determine his true reasons for attempting retrieval of the royal eggs.  The machine is satisfied with his reaction, and releases the eggs to Jesson.

Madhepura is a city and a municipality in Madhepura district in the Indian state of Bihar.

History.
The history of Madhepura is traced back to the reign of Kushan Dynasty of Ancient India. The "Bhant Community" living in Basantpur and Raibhir village under Shankarpur block are the descendants of the Kushan Dynasty. Madhepura was a part of Maurya Dynasty, this fact is asserted by the Mauryan pillar at Uda-kishunganj. A mosque of the time of Akbar is still present in Sarsandi village under Uda-Kishunganj p.s. Which shows its historical importance.
Singheshwarsthan has the religious significance since ancient time as this land was the meditation place of the great Rishi, Shringi. Hence, this place is considered to be the most pious for the Hindus. Sikander Sah had also visited the district, which is evident from the coins discovered from Sahugarh village

Sir Luke William Burke Teeling (5 February, 1903   26 October, 1975) was a British author, traveller and politician. He was known for his enthusiasm for a Channel Tunnel.

Background.
Teeling, who was from a prominent Roman Catholic family, was the son of the Accountant-General of the Irish Supreme Court. One of his great-great-uncles was hanged by the British for taking part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He attended the London Oratory School and Magdalen College, Oxford where he studied history.

Journalistic and literary career.
On leaving university, Teeling became a journalist and travelled widely both at home and abroad, especially in the United States where he described himself as an "amateur tramp". He lived among the homeless and hitched lifts on freight trains, reporting back to The Times about his adventures. In the early 1930s he also studied the youth movements in Nazi Germany. In winter 1933 Teeling had walked all the way from London to Newcastle upon Tyne, sleeping in hostels and examining the efforts of local councils to tackle unemployment. 

Another preoccupation when Teeling was travelling abroad was the treatment given to Irish immigrants and to the Catholic Church. In 1937 he wrote "The Pope in Politics" which suggested that Pope Pius XI was opposed to the new forms of Catholicism developing in the Americas. He followed this in 1939 with "Crisis for Christianity", a book which dealt with the relations between the Catholic Church and Nazism.

Parliamentary career.
When the Second World War broke out, Teeling joined the Royal Air Force. Having already fought the safe Labour seat of West Ham Silvertown in the 1929 general election, Teeling was elected to Parliament as a Conservative for Brighton in a 1944 byelection. This was a two-member seat, and Teeling was re-elected in the 1945 general election. The seat was divided into two individual constituencies thereafter, and Teeling was chosen for Brighton Pavilion.

Throughout his Parliamentary career Teeling remained on the backbenches, but his expertise on foreign affairs was acknowledged (he was a Freeman of Seoul in Korea). He was a strong supporter of all attempts to build a tunnel under the English Channel, and chaired an all-party committee which campaigned for it. He was also Secretary of the All-Party committee on Holiday Resorts. He was Knighted in 1962.

Later life.
Teeling resigned in February 1969, owing to ill health. He travelled to Africa to help his recovery. He became Secretary of the Irish Peers Association in June 1970, whose cause he had often promoted.

Maelienydd, sometimes spelt Maeliennydd, was a cantref and lordship in east central Wales covering the area from the River Teme to Radnor Forest and the area around Llandrindod Wells. The area, which is mainly upland, is now in Powys.

Originally an independent kingdom, Maelienydd became an area of great strategic importance after the Norman conquest of England, due to its position. It appears to have come under Norman control before 1093, but during the 12th century became a battleground between the Welsh rulers of the area, notably Cadwallon ap Madog, and the Mortimer family. In 1179 Cadwallon was killed by the retainers of Roger Mortimer when he was returning from the court of King Henry II of England. Mortimer was imprisoned by the king for this and Maelienydd was inherited by Cadwallon's son, Maelgwn ap Cadwallon. On Roger Mortimer's release from prison he seized much of the lordship, though Maelgwn was later able to recover it with the help of Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth. After Rhys' death the Mortimers again took possession.

The struggle for the rule of Maelienydd continued during the 13th century, involving the kings of England and Llywelyn the Great and Llywelyn the Last of Gwynedd. A number of castles were built here, notably Cefnllys Castle and Cymaron Castle. One of the main versions of Welsh law, the Cyfnerth Redaction, is thought to originate from Maelienydd when it was in the sphere of influence of Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth in the second half of the 12th century.

Maelienydd was one of two cantrefs brought together to form Radnorshire. The name survives for the general area.

<doc id="1187216" title="Christian Michelsen" nonfiltered="255" processed="253" dbindex="1480255">

Peter Christian Hersleb Kjerschow Michelsen (March 15, 1857   June 29, 1925) was a Norwegian shipping magnate and statesman. He was Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907. Michelsen is most known for his central role in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905,  and was one of Norway's most influential politicians of his day.

Born in Bergen, Michelsen was a lawyer and ship-owner. He became a member of the Norwegian parliament in 1891, representing the Social Liberal Party. He considered himself mostly above petty party strifes, and one of his major aims was to create a coalition of parties reaching from the Conservative Party to the Social Liberal Party, which he called the United Party. He became a member of Francis Hagerup's cabinet, and was one of the strongest proponents of a more firm policy towards the union between Sweden and Norway. In March 1905, Michelsen replaced Hagerup as Prime Minister, and immediately became the leader of the movement towards dissolution of the union.

The formal basis for the dissolution was King Oscar II's refusal to accept the Norwegian consular laws. The Swedish government had for several years insisted that laws governing foreign affairs had to be a part of the union agreement, and as such, consular laws could not be passed by the Norwegian Storting without consent of the Swedish Riksdag (parliament). The Swedes were willing to accept the Norwegian urge for separate consular affairs, but they demanded that Norway accept the precedent under which the union had operated for 90 years, namely that the Foreign Minister be Swedish. This, the Norwegians felt, acknowledged Sweden as having the upper hand in the Union. While this supremacy existed in reality, Norwegians were unwilling to accept the unequal relationship on a formal, legal basis. 



On May 27, 1905 King Oscar refused to sign the bill, and in response the Norwegian cabinet ministers resigned collectively. The king took no further action, probably aware that a dissolution of the Union was imminent, and the Swedish politicians did nothing, probably believing that this was another Norwegian political retreat. On June 7 the Norwegian Storting declared that because the King had been unable to form a new government in Norway after Michelsen's resignation, he had lost the capacity to rule and hence ceased to be king of Norway. This strategic move gave the dissolution a somewhat legal basis, and was primarily the work of Christian Michelsen. 

He knew that the Norwegian people, after months of well-directed information in a unanimous press, was united in a way that is extremely rare in a democracy. In the referendum that proved the Norwegian will to dissolve the union, retention of the union garnered a mere 184 votes nationwide, which represented only one vote out of every 2000 cast.

Michelsen, though an adherent of a democratic republic in Norway, accepted that a democratic monarchy would have the greatest chances to be accepted abroad and among a majority of Norwegians. Prince Carl of Denmark became King Haakon VII of Norway after a new referendum had given the monarchy proponents approximately 79% of the votes cast. 



In 1906 Michelsen won the election on a "above-the-parties" ticket, which quickly alienated the leading Social Liberals from him. In 1907 he resigned, having tired of petty squabbles among the political leaders, and accepting that his political views had been defeated. Jørgen Løvland carried on Michelsen's work, but lacked the will to force the coalition to stand united, and in 1908 the coalition broke down. Michelsen never reentered politics. Michelsen bequeathed a large part of his fortune to the establishment of a foundation for science and intellectual freedom, that later became the Chr. Michelsen Institute.

His distaste for party politics can be summed in the following quote: "The party congresses are the scene where a number of irresponsible politicians meet to make a tasty stew for the nourishment of their constituents."

In 1905 he was awarded the Grand Cross of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and in 1907 he received the Collar as well.

An RNA virus is a virus which belongs to either Group III, Group IV or Group V of the Baltimore classification system of classifying viruses. As such, they possess ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material and do not replicate using a DNA intermediate. The nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) but can occasionally be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Notable human pathogenic RNA viruses include SARS, Influenza and Hepatitis C viruses. Walter Fiers (University of Ghent, Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of a virus: Bacteriophage MS2-RNA (1976)

Characteristics.
RNA Sense.

RNA viruses can be further classified according to the sense or polarity of their RNA into negative-sense and positive-sense RNA viruses. Positive-sense viral RNA is identical to viral mRNA and thus can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA polymerase before translation. As such, purified RNA of a positive-sense virus can directly cause infection though it may be less infectious than the whole virus particle. Purified RNA of a negative-sense virus is not infectious by itself as it needs to be transcribed into positive-sense RNA.

Mutation rates.
RNA viruses generally have very high mutation rates as they lack DNA polymerases which can find and fix mistakes, and are therefore unable to conduct DNA repair of damaged genetic material. DNA viruses have considerably lower mutation rates due to the proof-reading ability of DNA polymerases within the host cell. Retroviruses integrate a DNA intermediate of their RNA genome into the host genome, and therefore have a higher chance of correcting any mistakes in their genome thanks to the action of proof-reading DNA polymerases belonging to the host cell.

Although RNA usually mutates rapidly, recent work found that the SARS virus and related RNA viruses contain a gene that mutates very slowly. The gene in question has a complex three-dimensional structure which is hypothesized to provide a chemical function necessary for viral propagation, perhaps as a ribozyme. If so, most mutations would render it unfit for that purpose and would not propagate.

 Replication .
Animal RNA viruses can be placed into about four different groups depending on their mode of replication.

Positive-sense viruses have their genome directly utilized as if it were mRNA, producing a single protein which is modified by host and viral proteins to form the various proteins needed for replication. One of these includes RNA replicase, which copies the viral RNA to form a double-stranded replicative form, in turn this directs the formation of new virions.
Negative-sense viruses must have their genome copied by a RNA polymerase or transcriptase to form positive-sense RNA. This positive-sense RNA molecule acts as viral mRNA, which is translated into proteins by the host ribosomes. The resultant protein goes on to direct the synthesis of new virions, such as capsid proteins and RNA replicase, which is used to produce new negative-sense RNA molecules.
Double-stranded reoviruses contain up to a dozen different RNA molecules which each code for a mRNA. These all associate with proteins to form a single large complex which is replicated using virally-encoded replicase to form new virions.
Retroviruses are single-stranded but unlike other single-stranded RNA viruses they use DNA intermediates to replicate.  Reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double stranded molecule of viral DNA. This DNA goes on to direct the formation of new virions.

<doc id="31621" title="Transient ischemic attack" nonfiltered="261" processed="259" dbindex="1480261">


A transient ischemic attack (TIA, often colloquially referred to as "mini stroke") is caused by the temporary disturbance of blood supply to a restricted area of the brain, resulting in brief neurologic dysfunction that usually persists for less than 24 hours. 

 Symptoms .
Symptoms vary widely from person to person depending on the area of the brain involved. The most frequent symptoms include temporary loss of vision (typically amaurosis fugax), difficulty speaking (dysarthria), weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), numbness usually on one side of the body, and loss of consciousness. If there are neurological symptoms persisting for more than 24 hours, it is classified as a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).

 Prognosis .
Patients diagnosed with a TIA are sometimes said to have had a warning for an approaching cerebrovascular accident. If the time period of blood supply impairment lasts more than a few minutes, the nerve cells of that area of the brain die and cause permanent neurologic deficit. One third of the people with TIA later have recurrent TIAs and one third have a stroke due to permanent nerve cell loss.

Causes.
The most common cause of a TIA is an embolus (a small blood clot) that occludes an artery in the brain. This most frequently arises from an atherosclerotic plaque in one of the carotid arteries (i.e. a number of major arteries in the head and neck) or from a thrombus (i.e. a blood clot) in the heart due to atrial fibrillation.

Other reasons include excessive narrowing of large vessels due to an atherosclerotic plaque and increased blood viscosity due to some blood diseases. TIA is related with other medical conditions like hypertension, heart disease (especially atrial fibrillation), migraine, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Treatment.
The mainstay of treatment following acute recovery from a TIA should be to diagnose and treat the underlying cause.  It is not always immediately possible to tell the difference between a CVA (stroke) and a TIA.  Most patients who are diagnosed at a hospital's Accident & Emergency Department as having suffered from a TIA will be discharged home and advised to contact their primary physician to organize further investigations.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) may show atrial fibrillation, a common cause of TIAs, or other arrhythmias that may cause embolisation to the brain. An echocardiogram is useful in detecting thrombus within the heart chambers. Such patients benefit from anticoagulation. 

If the TIA affects an area supplied by the carotid artery, an ultrasound scan may demonstrate carotid stenosis. For people with a greater than 70% stenosis within the carotid artery, removal of atherosclerotic plaque by surgery, specifically a carotid endarterectomy, may be recommended.

Some patients may also be given modified release dipyridamole or clopidogrel.

Measurement of traffic within a network allows network managers and analysts to both make day-to-day decisions about operations and to plan for long-term developments 2. Traffic Measurements are used in many fundamental activities such as :

Identification of traffic patterns and trends ;
Calculating the traffic intensity in a specific circuit or group;
Monitoring the service;
Dimensioning and managing the network;
Calculating tariffs;
Performing forecasting;
Dimensioning and managing the SS7network;
Checking the performance of the common channel signalling network;

The following sections will answer some fundamental questions about Traffic Measurement, such as: What should be measured; when should it be measured; what assumptions are made; and what errors can occur?

When should traffic be measured?.

Traffic Measurements are conducted on a continuous basis and the results compiled into reports for management which are used in management decisions on various time scales. Measurements that are taken every few minutes are used for network management and temporary routing, measurements every few hours, days and weeks are used for maintenance purposes and measurements that are taken over months or even years are used for long-term network deployment, upgrading and extensions .

To determine normal reference traffic for a network, the ITU recommends that a network traffic analyst must take measurements for the busiest hour of each day for a whole year . The busiest hour is defined as that four consecutive quarter hours whose traffic intensity is the greatest. Measurements taken outside the busy hour can be discarded. The reference intensity of traffic is then calculated by taking the average traffic intensity of the top thirty days in the year . Measurements taken on individual days can be discarded. This will give the normal high traffic intensity in the network, allowing network managers to make long-term strategic decisions .

Assumptions made when calculating circuits required.

To perform calculations in circuit-switched networks several assumptions are made :

Calls arrivals follow a Poisson distribution ;
Holding times follow a Negative Exponential distribution ;
Blocked calls are lost or overflow ;
There is statistical equilibrium;

It is useful to remember that the measurements are averages and this process deliberately ignores very short term variations in the traffic, but still allowing for a small but finite loss. The above assumptions are accurate if applied to circuit switched networks however they fail when planning for data traffic, small exchanges and sudden sharp peaks in traffic such as that caused by TV and radio phone-in competitions.

Traffic measurement errors.

Measurement errors are caused by faults in equipment or constraints on equipment design. The following five errors are examples of some types of errors that can occur :

Post-processing errors   These errors are generated by operators when analysing data that has been measured;
Pre-processing errors   These errors are generated by computers when compiling data for operators;
Statistical errors   These errors are caused by the averages in traffic measurements and by the fact that measurements are made from discrete samples ;
Database errors   These errors exist when errors are generated by faults in the storage of information;
Interpretation errors   These errors occur when analysts misinterpret data;

Cannonball Blitz was a game released in the early 1980s by Sierra On-Line (then known as "On-Line Systems") for Apple II computers.  The game is essentially a Donkey Kong knock-off, although the game substituted cannonballs and cannons for barrels and replaced the large ape with a soldier.  Also, on the first level, instead of trying to rescue a girl, your character catches a flag.

Although Cannonball Blitz attempted to put a different spin on the Donkey Kong style of gameplay (such as replacing ladders with teeter-totters in the first level, so a falling cannonball would send you to the next floor), the game is marred by frustrating and inflexible gameplay.  For one, your character has a much smaller jumping height than Mario from Donkey Kong, making it much harder to clear obstacles (and much easier for your character to die).

Another criticism is that there were only three different levels. The third level was particularly challenging. However, after completing the third level, the player would view a small celebration scene and then restart at the first level. This repeat of levels differed from the first round by changing up the timing patterns on the gameplay. It was very frustrating to complete the third level and realize that the game only had three levels.

Menckeneanea: A Schimpflexikon is a collection of articles and quotations denouncing H. L. Mencken, collected and arranged by Mencken himself. 

The word  schimpflexikon  is from the German language, which Mencken spoke fluently; it means, roughly, a dictionary of disgrace.  

Since Mencken was, in his day and later, a highly controversial figure, many of the quotations in the book are highly vituperative.  

Among the writers quoted or excerpted is William Allen White.  

The book was printed in a very small edition, and is considered a rarity today.

<doc id="2136" title="Angles" nonfiltered="269" processed="267" dbindex="1480270">




The Angles is a modern English word for a Germanic-speaking people who took their name from the cultural ancestor of Angeln, a modern district located in Schleswig, Germany. Ancient Angeln preceded all modern national distinctions and was probably not coterminous with the modern. For more information, see under Angeln. 

Evolution of the name.
The ethnic name has had various spellings. The earliest attested is Anglii, a Germanic tribe mentioned in the Germania of Tacitus. It is an adjectival form. One individual of this identity would be an Anglius (male) or an Anglia (female), which in the plural is Anglii or Angliae. The masculine is used for the generic form.

The noun from which this adjective was produced remains unknown for certain. The stem would have had the form *Ang?l/r-. Etymology theories have been:-
 From Latin angulus = "angle".
 From the Germanic god Ingwaz and the Ingvaeones federation of which the Angles were part. (the initial vowel could as well be "e" or "a").
 It may refer to fishing by the method called angling.
 The Old English word for the district of Angeln (where the Angles may have come from) on the Baltic is Angel.
 It may mean "the people who dwell by the Narrow Water (i.e. the Schlei)", from the Proto-Indo-European language root ang- meaning "narrow".

Pope Gregory the Great is the first known to have simplified Anglii to Angli, the preferred form for the Anglii in Britain, which he did in an epistle. The country remained Anglia in Latin. Meanwhile, English had changed its vowels. Alfred's Orosius uses Angelcynn (kin) for England or the English people; Bede, Angelfolc (folk); however, we also find Engel, Englan (the people), Englaland and Englisch.

 Early history  .
Angles under other names.

Two important geographers, Strabo and Pliny, are silent concerning the Angles. They both use the excuse that the south shore of the Baltic is terra incognita, "unknown land." They both go on to describe that shore, however. As the Angles took a geographic name, they must have had others not based on geography. The two silent geographers can help us with this question.

The knowledge of neither one of them predates Tacitus by very long. Strabo's mention of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest places his securely to the final years of Augustus' reign and after; i.e., the early first century.

Strabo (7.2.1, 4 and 7.3.1) states that the Cimbri still live on the peninsula (Jutland) where they always did, even though some of them liked to wander. Beyond the Elbe the coastal people are unknown, but south of them are the Suebi from the Elbe to the Getae (Goths). Strabo was moving in his mind eastward from the Rhine.

Pliny on the other hand moved mentally from east to west (4.13.94). His description leaves the Black Sea, crosses the Ripaei mountains to the shore of the northern ocean, and follows it westward to Cadiz. In this direction, before Germania is Scythia, where the Sarmati, Venedi, Sciri and Hirri are located, as far as the Vistula. 

Then the Inguaeones begin. Baunonia (Bornholm) is an island opposite Scythia. We arrive at Cylipenus, probably the Bay of Kiel, and from there to another gulf, Lagnus, which is on the frontier of the Cimbri. Its location is not known, but it must have been in the Angeln region.

In Pliny the Inguaeones consisted of the Cimbri and the Teutones (the Chauci as well, but they were not in this region). If Lagnus was on the Cimbrian frontier and was after Kiel then Angeln must have been in the territory of the Teutones. They were perhaps not named Angles at that time; however, the territory of the Teutones probably included the Propommern and the region south to the Elbe (mainly Holstein), accounting for the implied larger range of the people called Angles in later sources.

The Anglii of Tacitus.

Possibly the first instance of the Angles in recorded history is in Tacitus' Germania, chapter 40, in which the Anglii are mentioned in passing in a list of Germanic tribes.  He gives no precise indication of their geographical position, but states that, together with six other tribes, they worshipped a goddess named Nerthus, whose sanctuary was situated on "an island in the Ocean."  

The other tribes are the Reudigni, Aviones, Varini, Eudoses, Suarini and Nuitones, which are together described as being behind ramparts of rivers and woods; that is, inaccessible to attack. As the Eudoses are the Jutes, these names probably refer to localities in Jutland or the Baltic coast; i.e., they are all Cimbri or Teutones. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who just wrote it off as unknown and inaccessible country.

At the present time the majority of scholars believe that the Anglii had lived from the beginning on the coasts of the Baltic, probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula.  The evidence for this view is derived partly from English and Danish traditions dealing with persons and events of the 4th century (see below), and partly from the fact that striking affinities to the cult of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to be found in Scandinavian, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.  

Investigations in this subject have rendered it very probable that the island of Nerthus was Sjælland (Zealand), and it is further to be observed that the kings of Wessex traced their ancestry ultimately to a certain Scyld, who is clearly to be identified with Skiöldr, the mythical founder of the Danish royal family (Skiöldungar).  In English tradition this person is connected with "Scedeland" (pl.), i.e. Scandinavia, while in Scandinavian tradition he is specially associated with the ancient royal residence at Leire in Sjælland.

The account in Germania is contradictory to that of the silent geographers in at least one major point. Tacitus viewed the Baltic as the Suebian Sea and lists the seven tribes above as being in Suebian territory. The Suebi were among the Herminones of central Germany. And yet Pliny, who is just as creditable, accounts for the Teutones as being Inguaeones, the Ingaevones of Tacitus. In Strabo, the Suebi are to the south of the coast. The Suebian language went on to become Old High German, while the Angles and Jutes were among the speakers of Old Saxon.

An explanation no doubt existed, whether one of the authors misunderstood or the distribution of tribes in the 1st century resulted from an overlay of different historical schemes. At this time there is no verifiable answer to the question and no good reason for forcing an answer by excluding evidence.

The Suevi Angili.
Ptolemy in his Geography (2.10), half a century later, presents a somewhat more complex view, as might have been expected. The Saxons are now around the lower Elbe, to which they could have gotten merely by an extension of the Saxon alliance. East of them we find not only the Teutones but a dissimilation of them, the Teutonoari, which has an -oari suffix denoting "men" (wer); i.e., "the Teuton men." These Teutons or Teuton men appear to have been in Angeln and the land around it.

The Angles as such are not listed at all. Instead we find some Syeboi Angeilloi , Latinized to Suevi Angili, located south of the middle Elbe. Owing to the uncertainty of this passage there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the Angli. One theory, which however has little to recommend it, is that they dwelt in the basin of the Saale (in the neighbourhood of the canton Engilin), from which region the Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum is believed by  many to have come.

A second solution is that these Angles of Ptolemy are not the ones of Schleswig at all. According to Julius Pokorny the Angri- in Angrivarii, the -angr in Hardanger and the Angl- in Anglii all come from the same root meaning "bend", but in different senses; in other words, the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond Germanic. The Suevi Angeli would have been in Lower Saxony or near it and, like Ptolemy's Suevi Semnones, were among the Suebi at the time.

The Angli of Bede.

Bede states that the Angli before they came to Great Britain dwelt in a land called Angulus, and similar evidence is given by the Historia Brittonum. King Alfred the Great and the chronicler Æthelweard identified this place with the district that is now called Angeln, in the province of Schleswig (Slesvig), though it may then have been of greater extent, and this identification agrees very well with the indications given by Bede. Full confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named Wermund and Offa, from whom the Mercian royal family were descended, and whose exploits are connected with Angeln, Schleswig and Rendsburg. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, Frowinus (Freawine) and Wigo (Wig), from whom the royal family of Wessex claimed descent. During the 5th century the Angli invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recure on the continent except in the title of the code mentioned above.

The province of Schleswig has proved exceptionally rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. Among the places where these have been found, special mention should be made of the large cremation cemetery at Borgstedterfeld, between Rendsburg and Eckernförde, which has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in heathen graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at Thorsberg moor (in Angeln) and Nydam, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, &c., and in the latter case even ships. By the help of these discoveries, we are able to reconstruct a fairly detailed picture of Angle civilization in the age preceding the invasion of Great Britain.

 Angle influence in Great Britain .

According to sources such as the Bede, after the invasion of Great Britain, the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of the Nord Angelnen (Northumbria), Ost Angelnen (East Anglia), and the Mittlere Angelnen (Mercia). Thanks to the major influence of the Saxons, the tribes were collectively called Anglo-Saxons by the Normans.  A region of England is still known as East Anglia. 

The center of the Angle homeland in the north-eastern portion of the modern German bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein, itself on the Jutland Peninsula, is where the rest of that people stayed, a small peninsular form still called Angeln today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern Flensburg on the Flensburger Fjord to the City of Schleswig and then to Maasholm, on the Schlei inlet.  

In any case, this small and relatively easterly geographic localisation of the original Angeln tribal group has led to one of the Anglo-Saxon Invasion's enduring mysteries: how it is possible that the Anglo-Saxons were so frequently mentioned as colonisers of ancient Great Britain in all the ancient and medieval written sources, while evidence of the neighbouring and much more powerful Frisians' concurrent colonising activities in Great Britain has been so limited to discoveries in archeological science, and more often to logical deductions and inferences alone?  Of course, ethnic Frisians are known to have inhabited the land directly in the path of any migration route from Angeln to Great Britain (except for the long and difficult route by sea around the northern tip of Denmark), and, in fact, they also inhabited lands between the ancient Saxon domain and Great Britain; yet they are rarely mentioned as having taken part in the vast migration.

 St. Gregory .
The Angles are the subject of a legend about Pope Gregory I (ca. 540 604 A.D.).  As an abbreviated version of the story goes, Gregory happened to see a group of Angle children from Deira for sale as slaves in the Roman market.  Struck by the beauty of their fair-skinned complexions and bright blue eyes, Gregory inquired about their background.  When  told they were Angles, he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English:  Non Angli, sed angeli  ("Not Angles, but angels").  Supposedly, he thereafter resolved to convert their pagan homeland to Christianity.

<doc id="189181" title="Tony Cragg" nonfiltered="270" processed="268" dbindex="1480272">

Tony Cragg (born 1949) is a British-born sculptor.

Cragg was born in Liverpool, following a period of work as a laboratory technician, he first studied art on the foundation course at the Gloucestershire College of Art and Design, Cheltenham and then at the Wimbledon School of Art1969-1973. During this period he was taught by Roger Ackling, who introduced him to the sculptors Richard Long and Bill Woodrow. He completed his studies at Royal College of Art1973-1977 where he was a contemporary of Richard Wentworth. He left Britain in 1977 and moved to Wuppertal in Germany, where he has lived and worked since. 

Many of Cragg's early works are made from found materials and discarded construction materials and disposed househol materials. This gave him a large range of mainly man-made materials and automatically provided him with the thematic concerns that became characteristic of his work up to the present. During the 1970's he made sculptures using simple making techniques like stacking, splitting and crushing. In 1978 he collected discarded plastic fragments and arranged them into colour categories. The first work of this kind was called 'New Stones-Newtons Tones'. Shortly after this he made works on the floor and wall reliefs which created images. One of these works , Britain Seen From the North (1981), features the shape of the island of Great Britain on the wall, oriented so that north is to the left. To the left of the island is the figure of a man, apparently Cragg himself, looking at the country from the position of an outsider. The whole piece is made from broken pieces of found rubbish and is often interpreted as commenting on the economic difficulties Britain was going through at that time which had a particular effect on the north.

Later, Cragg used more traditional materials, such as wood, bronze  and marble, often making simple forms from them, such as test tubes.

Cragg won the Turner Prize in 1988.

Leopold Skulski (15 November 1878-after 1939, likely in 1940) was prime minister of Poland from 1919 to 1920. 

He was involved in politics from at least the mid 1910s, and served as mayor of  ód  between 1917 an 1919. He became a deputy in the Polish parliament (Sejm) after the 1919 elections, and on 13 December 1919 he became the Prime Minister of Poland. His government resigned on 9 June, in the aftermath of the failure of the Kiev Offensive and the success of the Bolshevik counteroffensive. He was also the Minister of Foreign Affairs under the government of Wincenty Witos (from 24 July 1920 to 28 June 1921). He was a member of the State Tribunal of Poland from 1925. President of the Polish Radio in the 1930s, he did not take an active role in political life in the last decade of his life. During the Invasion of Poland he was arrested in Pi sk by the Soviet NKVD; shortly thereafter he died in the NKVD prison in Brze   Litewski.

This article is about the mythological figure, for other uses see Meleager (disambiguation).;

In Greek mythology, Meleager (Greek:          ) was the son of Althaea and Oeneus and, according to some accounts father of Parthenopeus and Polydora. His story has similarities with the Scandinavian Norna-Gests þáttr.

When Meleager was born, the Moirae (the Fates) predicted he would only live until a brand, burning in the family hearth, was consumed by fire.  Althaea immediately doused and hid the brand.  Meleager married Cleopatra, daughter of Idas.  However, in some versions, he had to win Atalanta in a footrace, which was aided by Athena.

Oeneus sent Meleager to gather up heroes to hunt the Calydonian Boar that had been stalking the area.  Among many others, he chose Atalanta, a fierce huntress, whom he loved.  According to one account of the hunt, Hylaeus and Rhaecus, two centaurs, tried to rape Atalanta. Meleager killed them. 

Then, Atalanta wounded the boar and Meleager killed it.  He awarded her the hide since she had drawn the first drop of blood.  

Toxeus and Plexippus (Althaea's brothers) grew enraged that the prize was given to a woman.  Meleager killed them in the following argument.  He also killed Iphicles and Eurypylus for insulting Atalanta.




Since Meleager had killed her two brothers, Althaea placed the brand back upon the fire, killing him.  Later, Meleager was one of the Argonauts.  This may, or may not, have been the same Meleager.  With Atalanta, Meleager may have been the father of Parthenopeus, although in other versions Hippomenes was his father.

Stavies (in Greek "       ") is  a small village near the southern part of Crete, Greece. This village is built at a height of 240 m above sea-level, on the south edge of the valley of Messara and is mentioned in the Archives of Chandax in 1370. It is possible that the name Stavies has its origin in the Italian name Stavia, a town destroyed in the eruption of the Vesuvio in 79 AD. After the destruction of their village, refugees could have landed in Crete and built the present village.

It belongs to the municipiality of Kofina and nearby villages are Fournofarago, Dionysi and Vagionia. Its population approximates to 300 persons. The area is mainly agricultural and a large variety of high quality products are produced. Some of which are the famous Cretan Olive Oil and various products of grapes like wine, raisins and a local alcoholic drink named Raki ("    ").

<doc id="192503" title="Hans Memling" nonfiltered="281" processed="279" dbindex="1480283">


Hans Memling (Memlinc) (c. 1430 - 11 August, 1494) was a Flemish painter, born in Germany, who was the last major fifteenth century artist in the Netherlands, the successor to Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden , whose tradition he continued with little innovation. 

Life and works.
Born in Seligenstadt, near Frankfurt in the Middle Rhein region, Memling probably served his apprenticeship at Mainz or Cologne, and later worked in the Netherlands under Rogier van der Weyden (c. 1455-60). He did not come to Bruges until about 1465. A story telling that he was a wounded fugitive from the battle of Nancy is fiction, as is also the report that he was sheltered and cured by the Hospitallers at Bruges, and, to show his gratitude, refused payment for a picture he had painted. Memling did indeed paint for the Hospitallers, but he painted not one but many pictures, and he did so in 1479 and 1480, being probably known to his patrons of St John by many masterpieces even before the battle of Nancy.

Memling is only connected with military operations in a mediate and distant sense. His name appears on a list of subscribers to the loan which was raised by Maximilian of Austria (Maximilian I), to crush hostilities against France in the year 1480. In 1477, when he is falsely said to have fallen, and when Charles the Bold was killed, he was under contract to furnish an altarpiece for the gild-chapel of the booksellers of Bruges; and
this altarpiece, now reserved, under the name of the Seven Griefs of Mary,
in the Gallery of Turin, is one of the fine creations of his riper age, and not
inferior in any way to those of 1479 in the hospital of St John, which for
their part are hardly less interesting as illustrative of the master's power
than The Last Judgment in the cathedral of the Hanse city Gda sk (Danzig), Poland. Critical opinion has
been unanimous in assigning the altarpiece of Gda sk to Memling; and by this it
affirms that Memling was a resident and a skilled artist at Bruges in 1473; for the Last Judgment was undoubtedly painted and sold to a merchant
at Bruges, who shipped it there on board of a vessel bound to the Mediterranean,
which was captured by a Gda sk privateer, Paúel Benecke, in that very year. But, in order that
Memling's repute should be so fair as to make his pictures purchasable, as this
had been, by an agent of the Medici at Bruges, it is incumbent on us to
acknowledge that he had furnished sufficient proofs before that time of the
skill which excited the wonder of such highly cultivated patrons.



It is characteristic that the oldest allusions to pictures connected with
Memling's name are those which point to relations with the Burgundian court.
The inventories of Margaret of Austria, drawn up in 1524, allude to a triptych
of the God of Pity by Roger van der Weyden, of which the wings containing angels were by Master Hans. But this entry is less important as affording testimony in favour of the preservation of Memling's work than as showing his connection with an older Flemish craftsman. For ages Roger van der Weyden was acknowledged as an artist of the school of Bruges, until records of undisputed authenticity demonstrated that he was bred at Tournai and settled at Brussels. Nothing seems more natural than the conjunction of his name with that of
Memling as the author of an altarpiece, since, though Memling's youth remains obscure, it is clear from the style of his manhood that he was taught in the painting-room of Van der Weyden. Nor is it beyond the limits of probability that it was Van der Weyden who received commissions at a distance from Brussels, and first took his pupil to Bruges, where he afterwards dwelt. The clearest evidence of the connexion of the two masters is that afforded by pictures, particularly an altarpiece, which has alternately been assigned to each of them, and which may possibly be due to, their joint labours. In this altarpiece, which is a triptych ordered for a patron of the house of Sforza, we find the style of Van der Weyden in the central panel of the Crucifixion, and that of Memling in the episodes on the wings. Yet the whole piece was assigned to the former in the Zambeccari collection at Bologna, whilst it was attributed
to the latter at the Middleton sale in London in 1872. At first, we may think, a closer resemblance might be traced between the two artists than that disclosed in later works of Memling, but the delicate organization of the younger painter, perhaps also a milder appreciation of the duties of a Christian artist, may have led Memling to realise a sweet and perfect ideal, without losing, on that account, the feeling of his master. He certainly exchanged the asceticism of Van der Weyden for a sentiment of less energetic concentration. He softened his teacher's asperities and bitter hardness of expression.

In the oldest form in which Memling's style is displayed, or rather in that example which represents the Baptist in the gallery of Munich, we are supposed to contemplate an effort of the year 1470. The finish of this piece is scarcely surpassed, though the subject is more important, by that of the Last Judgment in Gda sk.

But the latter is more interesting than the former, because it tells how Memling, long after Roger's death and his own settlement at Bruges, preserved the traditions of sacred art which had been applied in the first part of the century by Rogier van der Weyden to the Last Judgment of Beaune. All that Memling did was to purge his master's manner of excessive stringency, and add to his other qualities a velvet softness of pigment, a delicate transparence of colours, and yielding grace of slender forms. That such a beautiful work as the Last Judgment of Gda sk should have been bought for the Italian market is not surprising when we recollect that picture-fanciers in that country were familiar with the beauties of Memling's compositions, as shown in the preference given to them by such purchasers as Cardinal Grimari and Cardinal Bembo at Venice, and the heads of the house of Medici at Florence.



But Memling's reputation was not confined to Italy or Flanders. The Madonna and Saints which passed out of the Duchatel collection into the gallery of the Louvre, the Virgin and Child painted for Sir John Donne and now at the National Gallery, London, and other noble specimens in English and Continental private houses, show that his work was as widely known and appreciated in the 16th century.

It was perhaps not their sole attraction that they gave the most tender and delicate possible impersonations of the Mother of Christ that could suit the taste of that age in any European country. But the portraits of the donors, with which they were mostly combined, were more characteristic, and probably more remarkable as likenesses, than any that Memling s contemporaries could produce. Nor is it unreasonable to think that his success as a portrait painter, which is manifested in isolated busts as well as in altarpieces, was of a kind to react with effect on the Venetian school, which undoubtedly was affected by the partiality of Antonello da Messina for trans-Alpine types studied in Flanders in Memling's time. The portraits of Sir John Donne and his wife and children in the National Gallery, London altarpiece are also remarkable as models of drawing and finish than as refined presentations of persons of distinction; nor is any difference in this respect to be found in the splendid groups of father, mother, and children which fill the noble altarpiece of the Louvre. As single portraits, the busts of Burgomaster Moreel and his wife in the museum of Brussels, and their
daughter the Sibyl Zambetha (according to the added description) in the hospital at Bruges, are the finest and most interesting of specimens. The Seven Griefs of Mary in the gallery of Turin, to which we may add the Seven Joys of Mary in the Pinakothek of Munich, are illustrations of the habit which clung to the art of Flanders of representing a cycle of subjects on the different planes of a single picture, where a wide expanse of ground is covered with incidents from the Passion in the form common to the action of sacred plays.

The masterpiece of Memling's later years, a shrine containing relics of St Ursula in the museum of the hospital of Bruges, is fairly supposed to have been ordered and finished in 1480. The delicacy of finish in its miniature figures, the variety of its landscapes and costume, the marvellous patience with which its details are given, are all matters of enjoythent to the spectator. There is later work of the master in the St Christopher and Saints of 1484 in the academy, or the Newenhoven Madonna in the hospital of Bruges, or a large Crucifixion, with scenes from the Passion, of 1491 from the Lübeck Cathedral (Dom) of Lübeck, now in Lübeck's St. Annen Museum. But as we near the close of Memling's career we observe that his practice has become larger than he can compass alone; and, as usual in such cases, the labour of disciples is substituted for his own. The registers of the painters' corporation at Bruges give the names of two apprentices who served their time with Memling and paid dues on admission to the gild in 1480 and 1486. These subordinates remained obscure.

The trustees of his will appeared before the court of wards at Bruges on December 10, 1495, and we gather from records of that date and place that Memling left behind several children and a considerable property.










Passion Altarpiece/Polyptych (1491) in Lübeck



Critical opinions.
 Erwin Panofsky in his 1953 Early Netherlandish Painting (p.347) says of Memling, rather harshly: "...while the Romantics and the Victorians considered his sweetness the very summit of Medieval art, we feel inclined to compare him to a composer such as Felix Mendelssohn: he occasionally enchants, never offends, and never overwhelms.  His works give the impression of derivativeness...";

<doc id="2385420" title="Triosephosphate isomerase" nonfiltered="282" processed="280" dbindex="1480284">



Triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI or TIM), is an enzyme () that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of triose phosphates isomers dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.




Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) plays an important role in glycolysis and is essential for efficient energy production. TPI has been found in every organism searched for the enzyme, including animals such as mammals and insects as well as in funghi, plants and bacteria.

In humans, deficiencies in TPI are associated with with a progressive, severe neurological disorder called Triose Phosphate Isomerase deficiency.

Triose phosphate isomerase is a massively efficient enzyme, performing the reaction billions of times faster than it would naturally in solution. The reaction is so efficient it is limited by the rate the substrate can diffuse into the enzyme's active site.

Structure.
Triose phosphate isomerase is a dimer of identical subunits, each of which is made up of about 250 amino acid residues. The three-dimensional structure of a subunit contains eight -helices (blue and red) on the outside and eight parallel -strands on the inside (violet and yellow). This structural motif is called an   -barrel, or a TIM-barrel, and is by far the most commonly observed protein fold. The active site of this enzyme is in the center of the barrel. A glutamic acid residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism.  The sequence around the active site residue is conserved in all known triose phosphate isomerases.

<doc id="3695489" title="Mike Dorsey" nonfiltered="286" processed="284" dbindex="1480288">

Mike Dorsey (born 1930 in Yorkshire, United Kingdom) was an Australia-based theatre and television actor best known for his long-running role of Reg MacDonald in the 1970s television soap opera Number 96. 

Dorsey's acting career began in the late 1940s when he started acting with the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in bit parts. After three years in the army in the early 1950s Dorsey returned to acting, with several minor stage roles on the UK provincial theatre circuit. The scarcity of acting work led to a career change to the publicity business, and Dorsey subsequently did the publicity in London for such performers as Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk and The Yardbirds. He later did two tours with The Rolling Stones, one of which brought him to Australia where he decided to settle in 1965.

In Australia Dorsey's career as an actor and performer quickly took off. Beginning in the mid 1960s he had several guest starring roles in Australian drama series including Riptide, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, and many appearances in the various Crawford Productions police drama series. During this period he also played the on-going role of Captain Roke in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-Artransa Films science fiction children's series Phoenix 5 (1970), was the straight man on Joe Martin's show Tonight on Channel Ten, and had a brief role as a police detective in Number 96 in 1972.

Beginning in January 1974 Dorsey played the regular role of comedy character Reg "Daddy" MacDonald in Number 96. An officious bureaucrat with the local council, buttoned-down Reg lived a regimented life and liked to speak in acronyms as a sort of verbal shorthand. He would frequently register his indignation with signature phrase "Great Scott!" Along with wife Edie - otherwise known as "Mother" or "Mummy" - (Wendy Blacklock) and daughter Marilyn (Frances Hargreaves) the character became a hit with viewers.

In late 1976 there were plans to spinoff the characters of Mummy and Daddy into a new situation comedy series titled Mummy and Me and starring Dorsey and Blacklock, but the proposed series was not picked up by the network and the characters remained in Number 96. Dorsey and Blacklock played in Number 96 continuously until it ended in August 1977, surviving several drastic cast purges during the show's closing months.

After the series ended, Dorsey, like many of his former Number 96 co-stars, had a guest starring role in school-based drama Glenview High (1977). In the late 1970s Dorsey and his main Number 96 co-star Wendy Blacklock created a stage show based on their Number 96 characters which toured clubs in New South Wales over a period of nearly two years. In 1978-1979 Dorsey played an on-going role on hospital-based soap opera The Young Doctors. He then took the regular role of Vic Marshall in Network Ten daily soap opera Arcade (1980), a notorious critical and popular failure cancelled after being on air only six weeks. Dorsey subsequently ran a theatrical group. 

Today he is retired and living in Rockingham, Western Australia but is still in demand as a voice-over artist and actor.

McCann Field House is a 3,100-seat multi-purpose arena in Poughkeepsie, New York. It was built in 1977 and is home to the Marist College Red Foxes men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball teams.

The Field House's namesake James J. McCann (1880-1969), a Poughkeepsie native, was a strong Marist Athletic  supporter and avid sportsman. Generous support from his charitable trust made possible the construction of the Field House. 

A maple floor was originally donated by former NBA All-Star Rik Smits ('87) for use by his alma mater. Following an accidental soaking of the court by a fire sprinkler, Smits re-donated a new court. A display honoring Smits, including an Indiana Pacers jersey, can be found next to the basketball court.

In 2005 approval was given for a $150,000 seating improvement project that will enrich the quality of seating along both baselines for Red Fox fans. This project will feature enhanced seating along the North baseline and an imposing 19-foot high student section along the south baseline. When completed, the student section and pep band will have seats located less than 6 feet from the baseline, creating an imposing and loud student section. An additional capital improvement slated for the 2005 season is the introduction of a 40-foot NBA style scorer's table.

The Northeast Conference men's basketball tournament was held there in 1984 and 1987.

The humpback angler, Melanocetus johnsonii, is a black seadevil of the family Melanocetidae, found in tropical to temperate parts of all oceans at depths of up to 2,000 m.  Its length is up to 3 cm for males and up to 20 cm for females.

Female humpback anglers have an enormous head dominated by a cavernous mouth full of long slender teeth that can fold backwards when prey is being swallowed.  The belly is distensible and this, along with the huge gape of the mouth, allows them to swallow fishes up to twice their own length.  Their eyes are small and covered by a thin layer of skin, and between them arises a large lure which is actually a modified first dorsal fin ray.

Males are free swimming when young but before they mature these small fishes (about a tenth the size of the female) attach themselves permanently to the hind body of the female and become parasitic. Their blood supply becomes continuous with that of the female and most of the internal organs degenerate: they become simply appendages to supply sperm when required.

Jack Dangers (born John Corrigan, 1965, in Swindon)  is an electronic musician, DJ, producer, and remixer best known for his work as the primary member of Meat Beat Manifesto.  He currently resides in San Francisco.

Career.
Prior to founding Meat Beat Manifesto together in 1987, both Jack Dangers and Jonny Stephens were members of a short-lived group called Perennial Divide. While Stephens remained a member for several years, Jack Dangers is the only person credited as a member of the band on every single Meat Beat Manifesto release.

In addition to his career with Meat Beat Manifesto, Jack Dangers has also contributed other projects.  Along with Mike Powell and Ben Stokes, he is a part of unusual breakbeat combo known simply as Tino.  Tino material is released through their independent label, Tino Corp.  Another collaboration called Loop Finder General was announced at one time, but the only recording that has surfaced under this name is a track on ¡Hello Friends!, a Jack Dangers DJ mix album primarily featuring Tino material.

As a remixer and producer, Dangers has collaborated with and reworked material for David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, David Byrne, DJ Spooky, Depeche Mode, Coil and many others.

Dangers is an avid collector of obscure audio and video material, and frequently employs samples from his massive collection of records and videotapes in his music and during live shows.

Dangers also collects vintage electronic hardware; he owns an EMS Synthi 100 modular system that he claims is the only known working model. This unit is featured prominently on RUOK?, released in 2002. 

An activist for animal rights and a practicing vegan, Dangers has contributed (as part of Meat Beat Manifesto) to two benefit compilations for In Defense of Animals.  He credits his active concern for these issues to fellow musicians Consolidated, for whom he has produced several albums and done a number of remixes.

Dangers suffers from acute arthritis, which makes it difficult for him to play many conventional instruments; consequently, many of the "real" instrument sounds on his records are accomplished electronically.

<doc id="955001" title="Starcross (computer game)" nonfiltered="308" processed="306" dbindex="1480310">

Starcross is a 1982 interactive fiction game designed and implemented by Dave Lebling and published by Infocom. Like most Infocom titles, it was developed for many systems.  It was released for DOS, as a PC Booter, Apple II, Atari ST and Commodore 64. It is Infocom's fifth game.

The game was Infocom's first in the science fiction genre. It takes place in the year 2186, when the player's character is a lone black hole miner exploring an asteroid belt. The player's ship, the Starcross, is fitted with a mass detector to look for "quantum black holes", which are such powerful sources of energy that one could provide a wealth of riches. When the mass detector finally discovers an anomaly, however, it isn't a black hole but something else entirely: a massive craft of unknown origin and composition.

The player must dock with the mysterious ship and gain entry to its interior. Once inside, the player discovers a wide variety of alien plant and animal species and an array of unfamiliar technology.

Feelies.
Deadline, which was the previous release before Zork III, had included several items related to the game and proved wildly popular. Starcross continued the newly-established tradition of feelies with the following items:
Log of the M.C.S. Starcross, a whimsical journal of the player character's experiences on the ship;
A letter from the "Bureau of Extra-Solar Intelligence" providing advice for any encounters with alien lifeforms;
A partial space map of charted masses, including instructions on how to use the navigation computer;

Notes.
The original plans for this game's feelies incorporated "Astronaut Food", which was to be a small package of something edible and presumably freeze-dried. The idea presented legal problems involving health laws, however, and was dropped. The foil-wrapped package is still depicted in a picture of materials included with the game, appearing on the back of the game box.

The first box for Starcross was a round plastic box that resembled a flying saucer disc. This proved too costly to produce and too unwieldy for store shelves and was replaced by more conventional packaging such as the "grey box" format.

Starcross was rated by Infocom as "Expert" level in difficulty. This may be largely due to the scientific orientation of many of the game's puzzles. Other early Expert-level games were Deadline and Suspended.

The game's working title was A Gift from Space.

Taglines.
The challenge was issued eons ago from light years away. And only you can meet it.

<doc id="5015303" title="Lord's Resistance Army (1994-2002)" nonfiltered="310" processed="307" dbindex="1480312">

The start of the period 1994 to 2002 of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency in northern Uganda saw the conflict intensifying due to Sudanese support to the rebels.  There was a peak of bloodshed in the mid-1990s and then a gradual subsiding of the conflict. Violence was renewed beginning with the offensive by the Uganda People's Defence Force in 2002.

For an seven year period beginning in 1987, the Lord's Resistance Army was a minor rebel group along the periphery of Uganda.  However, two weeks after Museveni delivered his ultimatum of 6 February 1994, LRA fighters were reported to have crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the Khartoum government.  The end of the Bigombe peace initiatives marks a fundamental shift in the character of the Lord's Resistance Army, which is estimated to have consisted of 3,000 to 4,000 combatants at this time.  This is the turning point at which the LRA becomes essentially the organization that operates today.

Sudanese support expands the scale of the conflict.
Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) fighting in the civil war in the south of the country.  Prior to this support, the LRA could be treated as a minor irritant in the outskirts of the country; now it also had to be considered a proxy force of the Khartoum government.  Sudanese support allowed the LRA to increase the intensity of its operations beyond the level at which it was previously capable.  Not only was a safe haven granted from which the LRA could launch attacks into Uganda, but Sudan also gave a large amount of arms, ammunition, land mines and other supplies.  In return, the LRA was expected to deny territory to the SPLA and periodically participate in joint operations with the Sudanese army.  The increased intensity of attacks through proxy forces led Uganda and Sudan to the brink of open hostilities in 1995.

Acholi civilians as targets.

There was also a marked change in how the LRA perceived the conflict.  Having become convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target the civilians using his increased military strength.  Mutilations such as those carried out in the wake of the Arrow Group strategy became commonplace, and 1994 saw the first mass forced abduction of children and young people. Other militant groups, such as the West Nile Bank Front, adopted the LRA tactics of abductions and raids. The strategy of forced recruitment was prompted by the lack of new volunteers to continue the conflict, and the fact that the young could be indoctrinated to support the LRA much more easily than adults.   Furthermore, the LRA no longer had to spend much of its energies in the search for basic supplies now that they were supported by Sudan.  The moral rationale was that since the Acholi adults had proven themselves untrustworthy, the LRA must cleanse the land of them and create a new society with the children.  This philosophical approach, similar to that taken by the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, has been referred to as "auto-genocide."

The attacks on civilians have at least three strategic objectives.  First, to deny the government information about its movements by forcing the rural population to flee. Second, to gather resources from the looted villages. Third and most bizarrely, to show the populace that the government is unable or unwilling to provide protection, and thus encourage people to support to the LRA.  While the lack of security has certainly embittered many Acholi, this has not translated into support for the LRA forces that are attacking them.


There were numerous incidents that occurred after Sudanese support and are exceptional because of the large number of victims, the identity of the victims, or the circumstances of the incident.  On April 22, 1995, Atiak Trading Center in northern Gulu District was attacked and the Local Defense Forces routed. Over the course of the day between 170 and 220 civilians were killed in the absence of resistance from government forces.  On March 8, 1996, a civilian convoy of over 20 vehicles with a military escort of 14 soldiers travelling west on the Karuma-Pakwach road was ambushed. Between 50 and 110 civilians were killed, most after the escort had been overcome. Some were executed; others were killed after they refused to exit their buses and explosives were thrown inside.  The LRA carried out three separate attacks on July 13 to June 14 1996 upon a settlement of Sudanese refugees in southern Kitgum (now Pader District) administered by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately 100 refugees were killed.  In the Lokung/Palabek massacre from January 7 to January 12, 1997, up to 412 civilians were killed in and around the subcounties of Lokung and Palabek in northwest Kitgum. There were no opposing forces and most victims were bludgeoned or hacked to death. 

The most famous attack of this period were the St. Mary's College/Aboke abductions on October 10, 1996.  At about 2 a.m. about 200 armed rebels broke into St. Mary's College in Aboke, northern Apac District, and abducted 139 secondary school girls between 13 and 16 years of age before leaving at about 5 a.m. At 7 a.m., the deputy head mistress of the college, Sister Rachele Fassera, pursued the rebels and negotiated the release of 109 of the girls. Five of the thirty remaining girls died in captivity; all but two eventually made their escape, as of 2006. 


Government forces have also been the focus of controversy.  On August 31, 1995, thirteen civilians, some with their hands tied behind their backs, were killed in a government gunship attack on an LRA column near Lokung, northwest Kitgum. Sixteen LRA combatants were also killed. Critics charged reckless disregard for abductee lives; the government claimed the killings were accidental and unintentional.  The military contributed to mob killings in Gulu Town on August 16, 1996.  Four LRA suspects were turned over to an Acholi mob that beat them to death. The suspects were under government custody and are reported to have been turned over to the mob in the presence of senior Uganda Fourth Division officers. 

The deaths of two Acholi elders on 8 June 1996 remains a mystery.  Mr. Okot Ogony of Cwero, eastern Gulu, Chairman of the Peace Commission of the Council of Acholi Chiefs, and Mr. Olanya Lacony, a respected elder from Kac-Goma, southwestern Gulu, were found murdered near Cwero in still unexplained circumstances. They were the leaders of a local initiative to restart the peace talks that had collapsed in February 1994 and had the approval of the President of Uganda and an invitation from the LRA. Some blame the LRA, while others point to corrupt National Resistance Army officers.

"Protected villages" created in 1996.

The creation of government "protected villages" beginning in 1996 further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many Acholi have toward the government.  While many Acholi were already displaced by the conflict, they resented being ordered into camps.  A strategy of resettlement, or "villagization," is a common anti-insurgent technique, used extensively for example by the United States throughout the Indian Wars to isolate Native Americans in reservations.   It is intended to free up troops that would otherwise be attempting to defend innumerable small communities and to deny the rebels access to resources.   Nevertheless, the population continues to be attacked by the LRA even within the "protected camps."  The camps are also crowded, unsanitary, and miserable places to live.

A culture of peace and a gradual subsiding.
The bloodshed in 1995 to 1996 appears to have convinced the population that a negotiated solution was the only acceptable option.  This is what one writer calls the emergence of "a culture of peace."  As most of the LRA combatants are abducted children, a military solution is widely seen by the Acholi as a massacre of victims.  Government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi.  The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, is vital in understanding the current conflict.   

Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese government of the National Islamic Front had begun to back away from its previous hard-line stance.  This was prompted by the leadership of new President Omar al-Bashir, who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from SPLA control. The U.S. had also taken a more proactive stance against the National Islamic Front government.  U.S. pressure on Sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al-Qaeda operatives with links to Sudan.  Over the next several years, Khartoum is believed to have substantially curtailed aid to the LRA.  In 1999 the Carter Center mediated the Nairobi Agreement between Uganda and Sudan, which restored diplomatic relations in 2001.


In 2000, the Parliament of Uganda passed the Amnesty Act.  This act pardons rebels who give themselves up to the Amnesty Commission and renounce violence.  While it did not end the insurgency, it proved effective enough in some of the other regions of the country that had experienced rebellion to be maintained.

The sudden appearance of LRA units in June 2001 who contacted local government officials to discuss the possibility of dialogue created a flurry of speculation that the LRA was tiring of their insurgency.  The Uganda People's Defense Force   the renamed NRA   created a demilitarized zone for the talks, a measure that had the implicit approval of President Museveni.  The talks were exploratory in nature and the LRA units eventually returned to Sudan.  However, analysts believed that they were initiated at the behest of Kony and indicated the most promising diplomatic environment since the collapse of the Bigombe talks in 1994. 

Following the al-Qaeda attacks in 2001 upon the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in the U.S., the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed.  The NIF government was anxious to avoid any blame that may be attached to them for their offering of sanctuary to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden for several years in the 1990s.  Also, following the LRA's designation as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department on 5 December 2001, Sudan agreed to stop supplying aid to the LRA.

Cross-border tensions were dialed down as support to proxy forces fell.  The LRA itself appeared settled into their Sudanese base camps and only periodically crossed the border.  Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the war began to return to their homes.  The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly of the day when the "protected camps" would be disbanded.

"Eye for an Eye" is the forty-first episode in the TV-series Danny Phantom. A series of pranks between Danny and Vlad turns the older half ghost into running for mayor which he wins in a landslide by overshadowing voters. Now he plans to torment Danny's life with his newfound powers. 

Episode Summary.

Vlad's well polished manor is dismantled when the Guys in White breaks in, suspecting him of holding ghost contrabands, courtesy of Danny who watches the news of Vlad's broken down manor via computer later on, much to both Danny and Tucker's amusement and Sam's concern. Vlad however gets his revenge when the Guys in White enters Danny's room for the same reasons as Vlad until Sam tells them off, claiming they can't search without a warrant. 

Meanwhile Vlad is staying in a hotel in Amity Park, taking a shower while watching the news of himself and the upcoming mayoral elections. He gets a rude awakening when news helicopters surrounds him during his shower caused by transparency from Danny himself, exposing himself to the public to get back on the prank Vlad pulled earlier. Vlad in turn pulls the same prank by sending his vulture ghosts to turn the walls invisible for the entire student body in the cafeteria to see him while in the boy's locker room shower. He ups the ante by getting the Guys in White to destroy the Nasty Burger (Vlad claiming of more Ecto-bestos inside) to which he is now the current owner of, having bought it off. Danny angrily chats with Vlad long enough for him to get the idea to run for mayor after the destruction of the fast food joint to up the challenge between the two.

Danny catches this news from his father who is eager to vote for Vlad as mayor, so he desperately heads down to City Hall where Vlad had just given a speech. There, the two battle, Danny stating Vlad's gotten weaker until he realizes at the last minute that it was merely a decoy held long enough until multiple Vlad duplicates overshadow the voters to vote only for him (Vlad having stated his powers have long since increased), making him win in a landslide. With his powers, he orders school uniforms, no technologies, and even a new Nasty Burger under the name McMasters' (now designed to ban teenagers), and most importantly, Vlad makes claim to the public that Danny Phantom's presence will lure more ghosts into their towns. Adding insult to injury, surveillance cameras everywhere in the city watch Danny's every move should he try and transform, much to his frustration. In lack of any Danny Phantom, Vlad does a tremendous job cleaning up any ghosts that haunt Amity Park. 

Frustrated, Danny transform after Tucker takes out a surveillance camera near Nasty Burger and phases his way to Vlad's office to apologize for his behavior. However Vlad doesn't accept it, criticizes him, then sends the Guys in White to try and destroy him. Danny escapes then later recruits his fellow peers on Sam's idea to stage a protest for the return of Nasty Burger, one that catches Vlad's attention as he comes up to them in person. 

There, with cameramen nearby (as well as Danny's parents), Danny turns ghost, then comes back to rat out that Vlad Masters and Vlad Plasimus are one and the same. However Vlad Plasmius comes out of nowhere in the same area with Vlad Masters. There both he and Danny fight until Vlad Masters aims a Fenton gun (taken from Jack) at Plasmius. Danny sees Plasmius is merely a duplicate of him used to make Vlad Masters look good in the eyes of the people by killing his duplicate self. Danny however possesses the duplicate and flies him towards his limo where Vlad shoots, destroying both the duplicate and the limo. Underneath the wreckage, Danny (now human) stages his own plan by making Vlad look bad for hurting an innocent child. 

As a result, Vlad announces to the public later to repent by returning everything he did back to normal, including the Nasty Burger allowing teenagers back inside, ones which the children are happy for. Danny declares, however, that his battle with Vlad is far from over.

Allusion.
 Title: "Eye for an Eye" refers to the phrase "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" from the book of Exodus 21:23-27. This principle is most famously used in the Code of Hammurabi.

McMasters, the restaurant Vlad erected in place of the Nasty Burger, is a play on McDonald's.

Vlad running for mayor alludes to Lex Luthor in the "President Luthor" Story Arc form Superman.

Tracy Lynn Byrd (born on December 17, 1966 in Beaumont, Texas) is a country music singer. 

Biography.
Byrd is the eldest child, and only son, of Jerry Lynn and Brenda Vaughn Byrd.  He and his sister Debra were raised in Vidor, Texas and were students in the Vidor, Texas public school system. 

Byrd never intended becoming a singer.  He began studying business at Texas State University (then called Southwest Texas State).  One of his friends coaxed him into singing a cover of Hank Williams Sr's "Your Cheating Heart" at a local mall recording studio.  The owner of the studio was so impressed with his version that he entered Byrd into a local talent contest.  Byrd discovered on that stage that he really liked the attention and applause that came with performing.

Byrd began playing nightclubs in Southeast Texas, including working with then-struggling artist Mark Chesnutt.  After Chesnutt secured a record deal, Byrd took over as the house band at Cutters Nightclub in Beaumont, landing his own record deal in 1992.  His first three albums sold over 3 million copies.

His first No. 1 single was 1993's "Holdin' Heaven," although many of his fans consider his follow-up hits "The Keeper of the Stars" (1995) and "I'm From the Country" (1998) the bigger hits. Byrd finally scored his second No. 1 hit in the fall of 2002, with "Ten Rounds With Jose Cuervo." He is also known for covering several 1970s-era hits for country music legend Johnny PayCheck, including "Someone to Give My Love To" (1993, Byrd's second chart hit) and "Don't Take Her She's All I Got" (1997).

Byrd is an avid outdoorsman.  He began fishing with his grandmother, Mavis Vaughn, when he was only three, and she bought him his first shotgun when he was six.   His love of those sports has given him the opportunity to host two shows on the Outdoor Channel.  

Byrd is the National Spokesperson for Special Olympics International for the Country Music Association.  He developed a crank bait fishing lure marketed by Norman Lures called The Lifestyles Of The Not So Rich & Famous, named after his hit recording of the song written by Byron Hill and Wayne Tester. For every one of the lures sold Byrd donates ten cents to the Special Olympics.

Byrd also hosts an annual golfing/fishing/music event, "The Tracy Byrd Homecoming Weekend," in Southeast Texas to raise money for local charities, including the March of Dimes, the Children's Miracle Network, and culminating in the donation of money to fund the Tracy Byrd Hyperbaric Medicine and Wound Care Center at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Beaumont.  Byrd also raised money by soliciting pledges for his attemp to complete the 2001 Houston Marathon.  He finished the marathon, and donated all of his pledges to the Children's Miracle Network.

In 1994, he made a cameo appearance in the film Radioland Murders.  He has also published Eat Like a Byrd: The Tracy Byrd Cookbook which "uses rubs and marinades to create memorable meals.".  He has also launched a line of spices, rubs, and marinades to go along with it, called "Tracy Byrd's Tiny Town Products."  These are available at Wal-Mart and Kroger stores, Byrd donates five cents from each sale to the Children's Miracle Network.

Byrd and his wife, Michelle, have two sons and daughter.  The family lives in Beaumont, Texas.

<doc id="45855" title="Power supply (Star Trek)" nonfiltered="317" processed="314" dbindex="1480319">
In the fictional Star Trek universe, starships have a power core that takes up most of the height from the roof to the floor of the engineering section of the vessel. In the 24th century all Starfleet vessels use matter/antimatter power cores. These use matter, heavy hydrogen slush/metal, and antimatter, antiprotons, and antineutrons.
The result is that the protons and the antiprotons cancel each other out in a small explosive blast as do the neutrons and the antineutrons. The remainder is the electrons and the raw energy created by the reaction. This is all focused by dilithium crystals into electrons and takes the form of a dense cloud of electroplasma (EP) and is transferred through the EPS conduits (Electro-Plasma System). The electroplasmic conduit system supplies power to the entire vessel. Electroplasmic conduits have several secondary bypass conduits in case the primary conduits are ruptured. They also have emergency routes that can redirect required energy to battle stations and systems during Red Alert. These emergency bypasses can increase the direct supply of EPS from the power core to the phasers and shield generators. Another name for a power matter/antimatter core is the "warp core", as it is used to create a subspace bubble around the vessel in order to enter subspace, thus allowing a vessel to reach warp superluminal velocities.

Michael Penn (born August 1, 1958, in Greenwich Village, New York City) is an American singer and songwriter. He is the son of actor/director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan, and the brother of actors Sean Penn and Chris Penn.

Prior to the release of his 1989 debut album March, Penn performed the song "This & That" with his band The Pull on a 1987 episode of Saturday Night Live. Before that, he was a member of the Los Angeles band Doll Congress and had appeared as an extra on a few television series, including St. Elsewhere.

March, particularly the first single, "No Myth," brought Penn attention, as well as the 1990 MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Penn's follow-up albums Free-for-All (1992), Resigned (1997) and MP4: Days Since a Lost Time Accident (2000) weren't able to match the success of March, although critics praised his songcraft.

Penn met fellow singer-songwriter Aimee Mann in the late 1980s, and during the recording of her album I'm With Stupid (to which Penn contributed vocals), the two struck up a friendship, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Together with manager Michael Hausman they formed United Musicians, which is based on the idea of allowing artists to keep copyright ownership of their works and to assist with their promotion and distribution. Penn and Mann live in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.  They have no children, but Penn has a son from a previous marriage.

Penn moved into film scoring after repeated requests from director Paul Thomas Anderson, who had apparently listened to Free-for-All extensively while writing his first feature, Hard Eight, and wanted Penn to score the film. Penn also scored Anderson's follow-up Boogie Nights, in which he appears briefly as a recording engineer. During the editing process of the film, Anderson directed a music video with Penn for the song "Try" from Resigned (the music video can be found on the Boogie Nights DVD). Other films scored by Penn include Alan Cumming's first two directorial efforts, The Anniversary Party and Suffering Man's Charity ; Melvin Goes to Dinner; the documentary The Comedians of Comedy; and The Last Kiss.

Penn's fifth album, Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947, was released August 2, 2005, on Mimeograph Records (Penn's own label) and SpinART Records. Penn has said that the album, which may be the first of two parts, is set after World War II and involves "the trauma that a war brings to a person's psychology." 

A best-of compilation, Palms and Runes, Tarot and Tea: A Michael Penn Collection, is scheduled for release on April 17, 2007, as is a reissue of Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947 with bonus tracks.

CARINE is a first-order classical logic automated theorem prover. 

CARINE is a resolution based theorem prover initially built for the study of the enhancement effects of the strategies delayed clause-construction (DCC) and attribute sequences (ATS) in a depth-first search based algorithm. CARINE's main search algorithm is semi-linear resolution (SLR) which is based on an iteratively-deepening depth-first search (also known as depth-first iterative-deepening (DFID) 1985). SLR employs DCC to achieve a high inference rate, and ATS to reduce the search space.

The Book of Fours is an original novel based on the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Plot summary.

Taking place during Buffy's third season, Faith and Buffy are the current Slayers and when mayhem caused by tidal waves and burning forests begin to erupt in Sunnydale as well as vicious attackers appearing with ceremonial axes, the gang knows that something is up. A woman named Cecile Lafitte has sent her Servants to kill the Slayers with special axes, Faith being the Slayer of Fire and Buffy being the Slayer of Air. Each Slayer has a special axe made to destroy the Slayer of that particular element. There are four axes in total; air, fire, water and earth. Should Faith and Buffy both be killed then it's believed that the line of Slayers would die out forever. Cecile wants to bring forth the Gatherer, and the only way to do so is to have the Slayers killed, which would feed the demon enough power to bring him forth into the world. Meanwhile, Willow ends up in the hospital with major brain trauma while Giles figures they need answers from the Watcher of the Slayer that preceded Buffy, India Cohen.

Trivia.

Tagline: 'To combat a quartet of unnatural disasters, four slayers must band together: Buffy, Kendra, Faith and India'.
India Cohen was the slayer that preceded Buffy. She is seen on the front cover of the book, the third from left. The character also appears in Tales of the Slayer, Volume III, in the story The Code of the Samurai.
On one page where Willow is talking about her dream with Matthew Broderick, Buffy says 'You pick the strangest guys to dream about, Will' . . . 'How come it's never someone current? Y'know like Seth Green?' Seth Green plays Oz, Willows boyfriend in Buffy.

Characters.

Buffyverse canon characters include: Buffy, Angel, Giles, Willow, Xander, Faith, Cordelia, Oz, Joyce, Kendra, Roger (Sam) Zabuto, Principal Snyder, Willy the Snitch, Sheila Rosenberg ;
Buffyverse non-canon characters include: India Cohen (Slayer); Kit Bothwell (India's Watcher); Lucy Hanover (ghostly Slayer); Simon LaFitte (voodoo king); Cecile LaFitte (voodoo practitioner); Mirielle (insane girlfriend of Zabuto); Anthony Yorke (traitorous Watcher); Micaela Tomassi (sorcerer); Cameron Duvalier (evil servant); Tervokian (demon); Cordelia's Mother; Willow's Father; Xander's Aunt & Uncle; Kevin Harris (Xander's cousin); Carlos New Mexico (crazy homeless man); Mark Corvalis (firefighter); Monica Hamilton (nurse); Holly Johnson (rescued girl); Amanda & Ben Johnson (Holly's parents); Neema Mfune-Hayes (Watcher); Ibn Rashad; Taran; The Gatherer (ancient demon); The Wanderers (Gatherer's four servants).

Continuity.

Supposed to be set late in Buffy Season 3, after Xander and Cordelia have broken up. Fits into an alternative continuity in which the events of the Gatekeeper trilogy took place a year before the events of this book.
Shares continuity with many Buffy books including the Gatekeeper trilogy, Immortal, and Spike and Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row.

Canonical issues.
;

Buffy comics such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as officially Buffy merchandise. ;

Timing.

<doc id="7422517" title="Hearing Secret Harmonies" nonfiltered="326" processed="323" dbindex="1480328">
Hearing Secret Harmonies is the final novel in Anthony Powell's twelve-volume masterpiece, A Dance to the Music of Time. It was published in 1975 to the relief of an audience that had grown steadily over the twenty-four years since the first book, A Question of Upbringing appeared in 1951.

Completing his meditation upon the themes of time and will, the author recounts the narrative in the voice of a convincingly middle-aged Jenkins. (Interestingly in the television adaptation of the novels an older actor was chosen to play Nick in the final part.) 

Whilst evading the trap of tying up every plot line Powell nonetheless satisfies the reader's pent-up desire to know the fate of the principal surviving characters. 

Though well received critically, Hearing Secret Harmonies has sometimes been held by academics to be the weakest of the twelve novels in the cycle. However Powell scholars like Hilary Spurling and his biographers, Michael Barber and Nicholas Birns broadly disagree.

A lyrical quality in the writing, not present in earlier volumes, has been detected, although the development of the character of the cult leader Scorpio Murtlock lends some astringency to the narrative. The sketch of university life in the late 'sixties offers a dryly satirical interlude before Widmerpool loses his final power struggle and expires in bathetic circumstances.

Plot summary.

In Spring, almost another decade on, the Jenkinses act as host to a caravan of hippies led by Scorpio Murtlock, allowing them to camp on their land. One of the band is Fiona Cutts (daughter of Roddy Cutts, thus a niece of Isobel's). Murtlock is keenly interested in the nearby Devil's Fingers standing stones.

Widmerpool is appointed Chancellor of a new university, and is promptly daubed with paint by the Quiggin twins (Amanda and Belinda, daughters of JG Quiggin and Ada Leintwardine); Widmerpool is thereby converted to the current counter-culture. Nick visits Matilda Donners, and is shown the photographs of the Seven Deadly Sins tableaux of 30 years before.

The Donners Memorial Prize is established. A year or so later Nick is a member of the committee who award the annual prize to Russell Gwinnett for his biography of X Trapnel. Widmerpool brings the Quiggin twins to the presentation dinner where he makes an impromptu speech, and the twins disrupt proceedings with a stink bomb.

At a Royal Academy dinner Nick gets an account of Dr Trelawney and of Murtlock's boyhood from Canon Fenneau. Widmerpool asks the Canon to put him in touch with Murtlock.

By Spring 1970 there are hints of Widmerpool and Murtlock joining forces. At midsummer conservationists muster at the Devil's Fingers and there are reports of naked dancers there the previous evening. Gwinnett describes Murtlock's attack on Widmerpool during a pagan sex ritual at the Devil's Fingers that night.

Spring 1971 sees a family wedding reception at Stourwater. Fiona Cutts, released from Murtlock's grip, appears newly married to Gwinnett. Widmerpool, leading a run by Murtlock's cult, arrives at the reception and pays embarrassing public penance to the bride's grandfather for a misdemeanour at school. Murtlock appears and ruthlessly extracts Widmerpool and cult members from the proceedings.

The final chapter sees Jenkins in Autumn 1971 lighting a bonfire and reflecting on a recent revival in Bosworth Deacon's pictures. He has recently attended the art gallery which is selling the Deacon paintings and where he met a now invalid Bob Duport, Polly and Signora Flores (Jean). While there he gets an inside account from Henderson (formerly one of Murtlock's followers) of life in the cult. Bithel (also part of the cult) arrives with news of Widmerpool's death on a naked run with Murtlock's followers.

<doc id="573460" title="Space Ghost Coast to Coast" nonfiltered="327" processed="324" dbindex="1480329">



Space Ghost Coast to Coast (often abbreviated as SGC2C) is an animated spoof talk show on the cable TV channel Cartoon Network in the United States, Bravo in the UK, and Teletoon in Canada. It began in 1994. The main cast comprises Space Ghost (born Tad Ghostal), a cartoon character originally from an old Hanna Barbera cartoon called Space Ghost which ran in the 1960s and early 1980s, and Zorak and Moltar, his former enemies from that show. Space Ghost is voiced by George Lowe, while C. Martin Croker voices Zorak and Moltar. Other characters include Brak, Lokar, Metallus, Black Widow, and Tansut, all of whom also made appearances in the original Hanna-Barbera series. The fictional talk show is shot and broadcast from Space Ghost's studio on the Ghost Planet. Space Ghost also has a twin brother Chad, who is somewhat smarter but has an apparent evil streak. Luckily, he can be identified by his ever changing facial hair, macho voice, and his use of hipster slang. 



Various celebrities appear on the show as guests. They are shown on a TV screen next to Space Ghost, and unlike the characters, they are not animated.

Space Ghost Coast to Coast uses the talk show format as its template, but subverts it regularly. Space Ghost himself is portrayed as pompous, ignorant, and slightly deranged. He apparently believes his guests are other superheroes and usually opens the interview by asking them about their superpowers. His interactions with guests are almost always painfully awkward, and sometimes hostile. It is sometimes hard to tell if all of the guests are really aware of the nature of the program on which they are appearing. Their answers often do not match the "questions" coming from Space Ghost, because the questions are changed after the interview. 

His relationship with his co-workers is worse. His bandleader, an evil talking mantis named Zorak, and his producer, a red-helmeted lava man named Moltar, work for Space Ghost as punishment for their crimes, and make no secret of the fact that they hate him.

Space Ghost is shown to be arrogant, showboatish, uninformed, oblivious to his own stupidity, and violent when provoked. His powers include invisibility (courtesy of his Inviso-Belt, although it's really just an outline of SG), flight, and the ability to shoot powerful beams from the Power Bands on his wrists. 

Zorak attempts to be "pure evil" ,even if neutered by his imprisonment, and spends his time on the show making fun of Space Ghost, generally getting blasted in return for his efforts by Space Ghost's power bands. At other times however, his resistance to Space Ghost is more oblique, preferring to just ignore Space Ghost's quixotic tendencies in a quiet method of rebellion.

Moltar is more placid about his predicament and enjoys watching CHiPs reruns on the monitors during the show, as well as talking to the guests before their interviews, but he will often chide Space Ghost along with Zorak and become his sidekick in tormenting Space Ghost.

Unlike most modern cable series, each episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast is only 15 minutes in length. To remedy this, Cartoon Network stuck two episodes back to back in order to make a 30 minute programming block, something Adult Swim (comprised mostly of the creators of SGC2C) has duplicated in much of its original programming. In 1995 Cartoon Network created a spin-off show called Cartoon Planet. This featured Space Ghost and friends attempting to host a variety show on the Cartoon Planet. Cartoon Network placed this show right after Coast to Coast in order to attract ratings. The Brak Show, a situation comedy starring Brak's hijinks as an adolescent, was also spun off as an independent 15 minute program.

Show production.
Part of the surreal nature of the show comes from the guests' sometimes awkward and disjointed responses to Space Ghost's questions and other events around the set. This is the intentional result of the production process that was first laid out in the original (unaired) pilot episode. This episode was created by Mike Lazzo, who interspersed stock and original material with completely unrelated promotional video of Denzel Washington being interviewed about the Oscars. When the show was picked up, similar interviews were orchestrated with guests to achieve the same comedic effect.

Before any part of the episodes are written, the guests are interviewed by a writer/producer.  Originally, a Space Ghost costume was worn by Andy Merrill, one which he later made famous in some Cartoon Planet intros.  More often the writer/producer appears in normal dress, but may still impersonate Space Ghost's character traits and mannerisms. In many cases, the interviewee is alone in a studio, while the interviewer conducts the session over a speaker phone.  In the all black room where the interview takes place, the guests are told what basic directions to look in to "talk" to Zorak, Moltar, or Space Ghost. The interviewer also rarely reveals his actual name so that the guest is forced to address him as "Space Ghost".  This serves to both maintain continuity and to engender a sense of bewilderment in the guest. 

Guests are asked questions which often reveal a hidden New World agenda. After an interview is done, the writing team goes back over it, taking pieces out of context and out of order, then assembling them into the "responses" to Space Ghost and the rest of the show. The episode is written around these canned reactions and the writing talent of producers Williams Street (known as "Ghost Planet Industries," named after the fictional studio where SGC2C is supposedly taped, for most of the show's run).

Most of the show's earlier guests probably assumed they were participating in a relatively straightforward interview (albeit with an animated superhero, giant insect, and a man made of liquid magma). As the series went on, however, more and more guests became at least peripherally familiar with what was going on. Some episodes were written to accommodate playfully hostile guests who called the show's bluff, such as comedian (and writer of one SGC2C episode) Joel Hodgson's refusal to, as he put it, "Go down that road with you, pretending we're in space and all". Others had skits written for the guests to perform in outside of the normal interviews. Still others had recurring guests, familiar with the show's format. Reportedly, "Weird Al" Yankovic walked into his Coast to Coast interview with answers he prepared ahead of time, but opted not to use them.

Theme Song.
The theme song for Space Ghost Coast to Coast, also known as the "Ghost Planet National Anthem" was performed by avant-jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock and his drummer, Lance Carter. The theme song was extended in the episode "Sharrock", as the episode itself is a tribute to Sonny Sharrock.  When the show reached its sixth season, the theme song was abandoned. It was shown a few times in Season 8, however, including a slow version for the episode In Memory of Elizabeth Reed. Seasons 4-6 featured a new closing theme by Man or Astro-man?.

Broadcast history.
In the United States, Space Ghost Coast to Coast premiered on April 15, 1994 on the Cartoon Network airing initially at 11:00pm on Friday nights, seven years before the advent of Adult Swim. Later the program was moved to various late-night time slots, usually on weekends. These late-night airings and the development of similar shows by Williams Street Studios led to the creation of the Adult Swim program block. Space Ghost Coast to Coast re-runs now air on Adult Swim's online-exclusive Adult Swim Fix service.

The show was initially broadcast on Cartoon Network UK during an early evening slot (around 6pm on Sunday nights), before eventually being moved to a late-night slot (around 10:30pm). During late 2001 and early 2002 four episodes aired every night at 11.00pm, though only ones from the first four years of the show's life. It later aired on CNX in its hour of comedy from 9pm 10pm alongside other programmes from the Adult Swim programming block. In Australia, it currently screens on Friday and Saturday nights in the local Adult Swim segment.

Space Ghost Coast To Coast was supposed to premiere on Teletoon in Canada in 1998, but never did. It was said that a celebrity somehow stopped that decision. 
However, it is now airing as announced, started September 2006.

New, short episodes currently play in rotation on Turner Broadcasting's GameTap online service (paid monthly registration required) in which Space Ghost interviews celebrities from the video game industry.

The episodes "Gum, Disease", "The Mask", "Le Livre D'Histoire", "Brilliant #2", and "A Space Ghost Christmas" were shown sporadically and then not released for DVD (due to video rights issues).

Though the show is on a "permanent hiatus" it has made two different returns. Once, after airing Perfect Hair Forever's pilot episode, Space Ghost was shown conducting a special talkback episode of the show with Early Cuyler, Sharko, and Meatwad about Perfect Hair Forever. The entire thing degenerated into typical Space Ghost/Adult Swim randomness, including Space Ghost himself being killed by Early Cuyler. After this, Space Ghost was only seen in cameos on Perfect Hair Forever where it was explained that after the end of his show he became a drunk that wandered around the Williams Street studios begging for a job. However, Space Ghost's show made another return on Turner's broadband entertainment network, GameTap. At E3, Space Ghost randomly showed up to conduct a series of live interviews including one with Microsoft executive Peter Moore. Space Ghost discussed bathroom etiquette, his own video game idea (A "dermatology based" video game), Sony, Turner, and dancing with Moore.

Beyond the original run of the series, at least two additional episodes were announced and had their respective interviews filmed, but were never finished.  These included interviews with Seth Green and Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane.  While neither of these interviews were aired in any episode of the show, an Easter Egg on the Volume 3 set features "Commander Andy" (Andy Merrill) talking to Macfarlane. Space Ghost has also been featured in a commercial for e-surance, interviewing the company's spokes cartoon Erin. Space Ghost spent most of the interview fantasing about sleeping with her.

Characters.
Space Ghost (voiced by George Lowe): Tad Ghostal was once a superhero and famous television star, but fell into obscurity after his show was cancelled. He sees his current employment as host of a relatively mediocre late night talk show as pale compared to his "glory days". He is remarkably egotistical despite his overwhelming idiocy and remains generally oblivious to his surroundings. He has little regard for the well-being of others and often demeans his sidekicks and guests.


Zorak (voiced by C. Martin Croker): The band leader and a mantis-like alien, Zorak is known for his hatred of Space Ghost. Extremely evil, he once ate his own nephew. He is a virgin, by virtue of not wanting to be killed by his mate, as is the custom. He has no remorse, feels no pity, and acts only to meet his own ends. He was Brak's childhood friend.

Moltar (voiced by C. Martin Croker): is the show's director/producer. His body is made entirely of lava, and he normally wears a full-body containment suit. By far the most competent and level headed character, he has attempted (sometimes successfully) to escape Ghost Planet on several occasions. He has been happily married for about five years to a woman named Linda, and his father was a professional wrestler.

"Swingin" Chad Ghostal (voiced by Brad Abelle): Space Ghost's evil twin brother distinguished from Space Ghost in physical appearance only by a crudely drawn goatee. He is a hipster, and is both extremely cool and evil. So much so in fact, that he makes Moltar and Zorak "look like total chumps". Chad loves Jazz music, hipster talk, and outdated slang. He is also quite the ladies' man. He is currently a fugitive, wanted for murder and escaping the asylum he was held in. He may be a rendition of the Space Spectre, Space Ghost's opposite number during his time as a superhero.

Tansut (voiced by Don Kennedy) is an overweight and cowardly man in a red costume and helmet. This outfit makes him out to be much more cruel than he actually acts. He is easily scared and is often ridiculed for his cowardice. For a while, he was the announcer on the show, telling the viewers who the guests would be for the episode, and has subbed for Moltar as director at least once.

Brak (voiced by Andy Merrill): Loud, childish, and physically harmless, Brak is the least threatening villain on the program. Yet his capacity to annoy others and eat beans is nothing less than potent. His most uttered phrase was, for a time, a loud, grating, "Hi, my name is Brak!". He is thought, by some, to have some mental deficiency (on the spinoff show Cartoon Planet, he claimed that "radiation half-lobotomized me!", possibly a reference to the original Space Ghost cartoon). He appeared on SGC2C periodically, and was often victimized by Space Ghost or the show's villains.  He eventually, somehow, obtained his own spinoff, The Brak Show.

Lokar (voiced by Andy Merrill):  Cultured and erudite, despite being a shrill-voiced giant hominid locust prone to violent outbursts. Lokar still harbors a bit of a grudge, and seeks Space Ghost's destruction, perhaps more for his boorishness than anything else. He is frequently accused of being effeminate by other cast members. He has a penchant for bourgeois phrases like "you go girl". He claims his hatred for Space Ghost is "delicious." He is also in a long-running feud with Zorak.

The Original Way Outs are the show's band, made up of former villains. They are apparently Space Ghost's prisoners, just like Zorak and Moltar, but are much less talkative. Usually, when they are cued to play music and the whole band is in view, music is definitely played, but not by them.  While the music is "playing," usually the only thing literally moving in the band is one cymbal on the drum set.

Harvey Birdman originally auditioned to be the host of the show according to Episode 40, "Pilot." He's similar to Space Ghost in that he is a washed up superhero, incompetent and slow, and horrible with people, not to mention that he can't work nights due to needing the Sun's energy to stay awake. Space Ghost once called him a washed up Six-piece Chicken McNobody. He reprises his role as host on Episode 74, "Sequel," during Space Ghost's brief imprisonment for abusing Zorak. He also appeared on the side lines during Episode 35, "Rehearsal", and making a call on Episode 55, "Telethon". He appears to be washed up, and in a rut, alternately claiming to be unemployed, or in one case selling towable campers. He used to be married to Gravity Girl, whom he constantly pleads to "come home". The character in SGC2C has little to do with the show Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law beyond giving the first name of "Harvey" to the character.

Metallus, a villain who can only talk in a metallic drone.

Black Widow (voiced by Judy Tenuta), a villain who has professed love for Space Ghost, much to the chagrin of the other villains.

Kirk the Storyteller (played by James Kirkconnell), the venerable narrator/storyteller, presenting several episodes in retrospect and reinterpretation.  The episode Curses was shown to have taken place in one of his nightmares.

Trivia.
 According to TV Guide articles written when the show was in pre-production, former Fantasy Island star Hervé Villechaize was to be Space Ghost's sidekick on the show. However, Villechaize committed suicide before production began.
 Some episodes suggest personal relationships with the guest. The most odd one was the interview with Al Alcorn in one of the GameTap episodes. Al, here known as "Mr. Pong" was, as Space Ghost claimed, "shacking up with a mantis (Zorak)" when he revealed himself to be Zorak's father. It is obviously untrue, even though Alcorn "has beady, cold-blooded eyes, and emanates evil".

 Cartoon Planet: Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak try to host a show on Cartoon Planet.
 The Brak Show: Stars Brak and Zorak from Space Ghost.  Space Ghost himself also made several appearances.
 Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Episode 87, "Baffler Meal," reveals that ATHF was conceptualized on Space Ghost C2C before it was turned into a series, although the actual episode aired after ATHF became its own series. The episode, as revealed in the commentary track on the ATHF Vol. 2 DVD was also produced after ATHF first showed on Adult Swim.
 12 oz. Mouse: Though not a direct spin-off, the Shark character is from Episode 79, "Kentucky Nightmare," where his original name was "Old Kentucky Shark.";
 Perfect Hair Forever: Again, not a direct spin-off, but Space Ghost and references to Space Ghost appear every episode.
 Toonami: Once again, not a direct spin-off, but Moltar was host of this block in its early days. Perhaps this is why he did not appear in Cartoon Planet.

"FoodLand" is the name of at least two American supermarket chains. 

Foodland Hawaii.

Foodland Super Market, Ltd. operates 29 stores throughout the state of Hawaii under the "Foodland" and "Sack 'N Save" names. It is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. "Food, Family & Friends" is their current slogan. The chain traces its roots back to 1948 when it opened its first store in Honolulu's Market City. By 1967 it would expand statewide. Today they are the only locally-owned supermarket chain in Hawaii.

FoodLand Eastern America.

The Eastern U.S. Foodland  operates 91 stores, including 37 throughout West Virginia, 2 in southwestern Virginia, 34 in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania, 8 in eastern Kentucky, 7 in southeastern Ohio, 3 in the panhandle of western Maryland, and 2 in the state of Michigan. Their slogan is "Close to Home." Every FoodLand location is locally owned and operated, with inventory support from SuperValu. To compete with other grocery chains such as Giant Eagle and Shop 'n Save, FoodLand is now operating gas stations/convience stores in the greater Pittsburgh area known as FueLand. All FueLand locations are located just outside the grocery store. An undetermined number of stores located  particularly in Alabama, share the same logo as the West Virginia-based chain but appear to be otherwise separate.

The name "Foodland," being fairly generic in nature and apparently not a registered trademark, appears as all or part of the name of countless unaffiliated grocery stores throughout the country, as well as in Australia, Canada and Thailand

A penny arcade can be any type of venue for coin-operated devices, usually for entertainment.  This included early forms of pinball and fortune telling machinery of the 1930s. Vending machines may also be considered in this category. The name derives from the penny, once a staple coin for such machines.

The earliest penny arcades from the nineteenth century had machines called bagatelles a game combining pinball and billiards.  Later, penny arcade machines grew closer to modern pinball.

Another form of machine found in penny arcades were peep show machines (ancient usage of the term) which allowed the viewer to see various views of objects and later moving pictures. Slot machines, love testers, fortune teller machines and other coin operated devices were found in such venues.

Penny arcades later led to the creation of video arcades in the 1970s.

"Adrift" is the 26th episode of Lost. It is the second episode of the show's second season. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Steven Maeda and Leonard Dick. It first aired on September 28, 2005 on ABC. The character of Michael Dawson is featured in the episode's flashback.



Plot. 

Sawyer surfaces in the ocean after the attack on the raft. The raft is burning, with pieces of wreckage floating everywhere. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screaming for Jin. Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of flotsam and performing CPR. 

On their makeshift raft, Michael blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, something pounds on the raft from below. When Sawyer and Michael investigate, they see the distinctive fin of a shark. Michael blames Sawyer's bleeding wound for attracting the shark, and this devolves into an argument which ends when Michael orders Sawyer off his piece of raft. Sawyer complies, moving onto another piece of the raft, but soon the two are arguing again. Sawyer's piece of raft disintegrates, forcing him to rejoin Michael.

As they continue to float along with the current, one of the raft's pontoons appears, and they decide to board it. Sawyer swims to the pontoon, giving Michael his gun in case the shark appears. When it does, Michael fires several times, apparently injuring the shark, which breaks off.  Michael numbly swims for the pontoon, where Sawyer waits for him.

During Michael's flashbacks, he remembers his early custody struggles with Susan, who has asked Michael to sign away his paternal rights to Walt. Though Michael initially resists, suing to keep his rights, he eventually relents as Susan persuades him to doubt his own motivations and whether he is pursuing his own desires or Walt's best interests. As part of the flashback there is a parting scene between Michael and Walt. Michael gives Walt a toy polar bear.

When day breaks on the raft, Michael is crying. He realizes that he should not have brought Walt with him on the raft, even if all he really wanted was to be with his son. Michael tells Sawyer that Walt's kidnapping was his own fault. At this point, Sawyer notices that they are back at the island. When they wash ashore, they are greeted by Jin running toward them, hands tied behind his back, shouting the word "Others", and fleeing a group holding him captive.

Back at camp, Claire discovers Charlie carrying the Virgin Mary statue stolen from the Beechcraft 18, but does not know about the heroin contained inside.

After Kate disappears into the hatch, Locke descends as well, finding an unconscious Kate in the computer room. An armed Desmond walks up behind them, and asks Locke if he is "him". Locke at first claims to be the person whom Desmond is seeking, but fails to correctly answer the riddle that Desmond poses to him.  This failure prompts Desmond to round up the two. Desmond orders Kate to tie Locke up, but Locke convinces Desmond she should be tied up. When Desmond concurs, Locke slides her one of his knives, and locks her in a dark room. Kate frees herself, and turns on a light, amazed to find herself in a large pantry filled with foodstuffs, all in boxes bearing a strange marking. After enjoying a chocolate bar, she climbs into a ventilation shaft, while Locke and Desmond take turns asking each other questions.

The plotline converges to the same point at the end of the last episode, Man of Science, Man of Faith. An alarm klaxon begins to sound. Desmond walks Locke at gunpoint to the computer terminal, and forces him to enter "the numbers" into the computer, which resets a timer for the alarm. Soon after, Desmond detects Jack, and after channeling him to the computer room, forces Locke to greet Jack as seen in the previous episode (though this time, we see Kate's perspective too, overhead in the ventilation shaft).

Trivia.

When Sawyer is getting ready to swim to the other platform, a shark swims past, and in an underwater shot the DHARMA Initiative insignia can briefly be seen near its back fin. However, according to the bonus material disc on the Season Two DVD, this was not meant to be significant, but was simply an inside joke or "easter egg", which turned out to be more visible than had been intended.

Mudflap (Demolishor in Japan) is the name of a single character in the Transformers universes.

 (2005).

Mudflap transforms into a construction crane. In the Japanese version of the series; Transformers: Galaxy Force, the character is called Demolishor.

In the cartoon, Mudflap was originally one of the Autobot civilian refugees hiding on Earth. Disgruntled with having to exist in secret amongst the lowly  human race and stopping at traffic lights, Mudflap was sought out and recruited to join the Decepticons by Starscream, but then he left and wandered Earth. Eventually Mudflap rejoins the Autobots. 

His toyline bio, however, tells a different story. In this version of events, Mudflap was an undercover Decepticon operative placed on Earth before the Autobots had even arrived. Having infiltrated the construction industry, he spent his time sabotaging the infrastructure of human society.

According to the additional information accessible online by entering the code printed on the back of toy's Cyber Planet Key at the official Transformers website, Mudflap is a former boxer.

The toy of Mudflap was sold in the larger "Voyager" size class. The toy was initially sold by itself, and later sold at Target stores with the Mini-Cons Shockwave and Tankor attached as a promotion.

Animated series.
Main Episode Appearances:
Ep.15-Race: Mudflap joins the Decepticons
Ep.20-Ice: Starscream and Mudflap attack the humans at the North Pole and Mudflap beats Scattorshot to a pulp.
Ep.23-Trust: Mudflap battles Snarl and Leobreaker on the Jungle Planet, but loses.
Ep.27-Revalations: Landmine discovers that Mudflap is evil. Mudflap says that he doesn't want to hurt Landmine, but he's "gotta' do what he's gotta do!" So they duke it out.
Ep.33-Balance: When Megatron, Scourge, and Thunderblast head into the debris field surrounding Cybertron, Mudflap, thinking Megatron has betrayed him, heads back to Earth.
Ep.37-Family: As Mudflap is beating up some trees, he wonders to himself why he had joined the Decepticons. Landmine shows up and Mudflap becomes an Autobot again. 

When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Jungle Planet back into it's orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets (including Mudflap) were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.

Mudflap's voice in the Cybertron cartoon is performed with some variation of a French accent - viewers have disagreed over whether it is intended to sound Cajun, French Canadian, or just generically French.

Trivia.
When the character of Signal Lancer was animated in the final episode of Cybertron, the animators used a slightly modified transformation sequence from Mudflap. 

Early concept art of Mudflap shown at Botcon 2006 showed concept art of the character done in dark blue with white and gold highlights.

RS250-Squid is the online username of Andy Briggs, a young English motorcyclist from Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

 Early years .


Born in 1985, Squid attended local queen schools before going on to study at Thomas Rotherham College in Rotherham. He stayed here for a short time, studying various nondescript pointless subjects, and maintaining an active interest in young boys, music and automotive technology. While his interest in these subjects was seen as commendable, it did not help him with the college subjects he had chosen to study, and he soon left college after reaching mutual consent due to unsatisfactory punctuality and attendance.

Shortly after leaving a second college, Andy went into his first term of paid employment, working for Alchemy Pewter, part of the Alchemy Gothic group. Here he studied as an apprentice metalsmith before again, coming to a mutual agreement with the company that employment in his position was not best suited to him. However, before Andy left the company, he became interested in motorcycles, due to the building (then) being in close proximity to a local bike showroom, at that time, a local Honda dealers. It was shortly before he left Alchemy, that Andy bought his first motorcycle helmet, and his interest in bikes took off from there.

 Biking Years .

Throughout his search for a new job, Andy's interest in bikes if anything became stronger, and he eventually managed to purchase a second-hand bike, a Honda NSR125.

Andy, or "Squid" as he is known to his friends and employers, is now a keen motorcyclist, and rides his Aprilia RS50 when he can find the keys. He is a regular participant and active member of both the Sheffield Bikers group, and Visordown, both online forums that cater to the needs of motorcyclists. While something of a source of constipation and indeed at times, anger, among members of the Visordown community, Andy's "there is no such thing as black and white" attitude to life, and tolerance of the occasional cutting remark have earned him both friends and respect among the members of both sites.

 The Future .

Andy is continuing to spend time working with various 3D applications and is considering becoming a professional graphics artist. As an alternative however, he has hinted that he may be interested in a military carreer.

An Air Scout Troop can apply to become recognised with the Royal Air Force and thus can receive special opportunities and trips. This RAF Recognition is subject to a regular 18 month inspection by a designated RAF Reserve Officer.

United States of America.
Air Scouts is a now-defunct program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The Air Scouts program had four ranks Apprentice, Observer, Craftsman, and Ace. The Ace cloth knot and medal may still be worn by anyone who earned them before the program was dropped.

The program was established in 1941 and existed under the name Air Scouts until 1949, when it was renamed Air Explorers.  With minor changes, this program lasted until 1965, when it was fully merged into the then existing Explorer program of the BSA as a specialty called 'Aviation Explorers'.  It still exists today as part of the BSA's Learning for Life Explorer program.

Youth in the United States of America interested in non-profit organizations based around flying should also look into the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program.

<doc id="5527990" title="Singapore general election, 1959" nonfiltered="346" processed="343" dbindex="1480348">


The 1959 Singapore legislative assembly general election was a general election held in Singapore on 30 May 1959 to choose the members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore. Under the Constitution of Singapore in 1959, the members of Legislative Assembly was fully determined by the population of Singapore, and the political party who won the majority of the assembly seats would form the ruling government, much like the modern Parliament of Singapore. Candidates were nominated on 25 April 1959 and the actual polls were held on 30 May. The People's Action Party (PAP) eventually won the general election in a landslide, winning 43 out of 51 seats.

The 1959 general election was the PAP's first victory in terms of being the ruling party of Singapore. Presently it continues to be the ruling party of Singapore, and has never lost control of the Singaporean legislature since the 1959 elections. It was the first election after which Singapore officially achieved self rule.

An election of firsts.

The 1959 general election was also the first election to be held since full internal self-government was granted by the British Empire, which Singapore was part of at the time. Compulsory voting was also implemented for the first time. 

Singapore was not fully independent, as the British still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations. However, Singapore was now a recognised state and the entire Legislative Assembly for the first time was wholly determined by the local population. Previously under the Rendel Constitution, which was a 1955 reform of the Constitution of Singapore, the legislature and its leaders could not fully be determined by the population. The British government instead appointed 7 of the 33 total members, although the rest was by election with limited suffrage. This itself was an improvement from the pre-1955 Legislative Council of Singapore when only 6 out of over twenty members were elected.

Campaign issues and platforms.
Discontent with the Labour Front.

The ruling party at the time was the Labour Front, which had won the general election of 1955. David Saul Marshall, who headed the Labour Front in 1955 and was chosen as Chief Minister, had since resigned in 1956. By 1959, the Labour Front was in turmoil, although they had been very successful at campaigning in 1955. Much of the issues resounded around the topic of independence as well as political issues such as the communist insurgency led by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) which had been causing the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960). 

During the 1955 election, the PAP protested against the existence of appointed members as set forth by the Rendel Constitution, and become the main opposition party following the election, and the  Singapore Progressive Party (SPP) which had been one of the most dominant parties in the 1948 election and the 1951 election had become increasingly displaced at this point. The desire for independence and self-government epitomised by the Malay term Merdeka, had started to become immediate. This was reflected when the cry of "We want Merdeka now!" was taken up by those demanding immediate independence. The SPP fell out of favour as it was perceived by much of the electorate by working for reform too slowly.

David Marshall was vocally anti-British and anti-colonialist, and the British found it difficult to come to an agreement or a compromise. Eventually after failing to reach any agreement about a definite plan for self-government he resigned in 1956, following a pledge that he would achieve self-government or resign. Lim Yew Hock, another Labour Front member, took his place. He pursued an aggressive anti-communist campaign and manage to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government. The Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly. 

However, Lim's tactics against the communists alienated a large part of the Singaporean Chinese electorate, the demographic targeted most during the anti-communist campaign. There were also allegations of civil rights violations as many activists were detained without trial with the justification of internal security and tear gas were used against demonstrating students from several Chinese schools, both anti-colonialist and anti-communist alike.

Campaign of the People's Action Party. 


The People's Action Party made an election issue out of the harsh repression by Lim Yew Hock. The PAP was left-wing at the time and attracted many sympathisers. In addition to many left-wing members, there were also many centrist members and a handful of right-wing members at the time. The party was thus able to attract support from a large and diverse electorate.

The PAP pursued an aggressive election campaign which included large rallies and door-to-door campaigning. As the Labour Front government was rife with corruption and perceived misdealing, the PAP capitalised on this by promoting a "corruption-free" image, and its members' white robes were to signify the purity that the PAP declared it had in contrast to the Labour Front. The name of the PAP promising "action" and reform went along with this portrayal. Already a formidable faction at the 1955 general elections, the PAP grew exceptionally popular.

Results.

The voter turnout for the election was 527,919 out of a total 586,098 voters, or 92.9% of the total eligible voters. This was a huge turnout, especially when compared to the 1955 general election in which only 158,075 of 300,199 voters turned out, or 52.7% of the total eligible voters. There were two historical attributions for this. One was the implementation of compulsory voting, the other the removal of suffrage restrictions that had previously limited voting rights to those born in Singapore, or those who had lived there for a certain amount of time.

Over 51 seats were available for contesting during the election, which was almost a 50% increase from the total seats at the 1955 general election, and more than double of the seats if only elected seats are considered. In contrast to the elections that would follow in the future after the 1963 general election, there were no walkovers.



Legacy.

With the successful conclusion of the election, all the members of the Parliament were now elected, and thus theoretically achieved full consent of the governed. The PAP as ruling party was able to form a new government of Singapore on 3 June 1959 that was fully elected which could now adopt domestic policy without oversight from the colonial administration. The United Kingdom still however controlled the military forces, foreign affairs and had a joint responsibility in internal security under agreement. However, the year of the conclusion of the elections and the formation of the new government   1959   is generally the date specified by historians for the achievement of self-government for Singapore, even though the Constitution had been amended in 1958.

Before taking over the governance of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew secured the release of several PAP members, who were arrested under the Emergency Regulation in 1956 and 1957,  including left-wing leader Lim Chin Siong. During the election campaign, Lee had advocated for their release as part of his election platform, and thus was able to mobilise the support of many trade union members. 

After their release, Lim Chin Siong and his affiliates would later challenge Lee's leadership in the PAP, leading to the expulsion of most of the left-wing members from the PAP in 1961. The expelled members formed the Barisan Sosialis, and would contest the 1963 general elections against the PAP. Although having been crippled by Operation Coldstore, they put up a fight that to date, is the only election that threatened to remove the PAP from power while it was an existing ruling party. It however lost and went into a decline, affirming the PAP as ruling party.

By elections.
During the course of the parliament, two by-elections were held:
Singapore by-election, April 1961;
Singapore by-election, July 1961;

<doc id="4102521" title="Glycol cleavage" nonfiltered="347" processed="344" dbindex="1480349">
Glycol cleavage is a specific type of organic chemistry oxidation. The C-C bond between two OH groups is cleaved and replaced with C=O bonds. The ketone is formed on the more highly substituted carbon next to the hydroxyl group being attacked. The aldehyde forms on the less substituted side. 

Glycol cleavage is an important reaction in the laboratory because it is useful for determining the structures of sugars. After cleavage takes place the keto-aldehyde fragments can be inspected and the location of the former hydroxyl groups ascertained. 

Reagents.

Periodic acid (HIO4) is one of the most convenient ways to cleave a glycol. It is thought to involve a cyclic periodate intermediate which then stabilizes into a keto-aldehyde. Periodic cleavage of a glycol yields the same result as ozonolysis reduction of an alkene (followed by dimethyl sulfate).

Warm and concentrated potassium permanganate (KMnO4) will react with an alkene to form a glycol and will then immediately cleave the glycol to give a stable ketone and an oxidizable aldehyde. The aldehyde reacts to become a carboxylic acid. Controlling the temperature and concentration of the reagent can keep the reaction from continuing past the formation of the glycol.

Nomenclature.
The term glycol means a 1,2-diol, also called a vicinal diol. This indicates a molecular structure consisting of two hydroxyl (OH) groups on adjacent (hence 1,2) carbon atoms. Common glycols are ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and propylene glycol (used in medicine and foods).

Synthesis of Glycols.
Glycols can be synthesized by the hydroxylation of alkenes. Hydroxyl groups are added across the double bond yielding cis stereochemistry. This oxidation reaction can be accomplished with osmium tetroxide (OsO4) followed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cold, dilute potassium permanganate (KMnO4) followed by a strong base (HO-) will yield the same result with reduced yields.

Bishop Elliott G. Thomas is a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church.

He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on July 25, 1926. Thomas's family had lived in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, returning there in 1934. Elliott Thomas was enrolled in the Methodist Day School in Road Town and as a teenager attended Charlotte Amalie High School in St. Thomas, where he graduated in 1945.

Following his graduation, he served as a Clerk of the Municipal Homestead Commission and Clerk of the Adult Evening School in St. Thomas. In 1945, he enrolled in the College of Pharmacy at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1950. After qualifying as a registered pharmacist in Detroit, Michigan he joined the United States Army and was assigned to FranMort-Hoechst and to Munich, Germany.

After returning to the Virgin Islands, he became a pharmacist in St. Thomas. From 1954 - 1959, he worked as a pharmacist with the Veterans Administration in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he also studied part-time at Gannon College, majoring in Business Administration.

On October 2, 1957 he converted to Catholicism and was received into the Church at St. Peter's Cathedral in Erie, Pennsylvania. He began his studies for the priesthood in 1982 at St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary in Boynton Beach, Florida. He was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands on June 6, 1986, and was appointed Episcopal Vicar for the Diocese and pastor of Holy Family Church.

Father Thomas served as pastor of St. Ann's Church on St. Croix, pastor of Holy Family Church, Dean of the Diocese and the Vicar General. The Diocesan Consulters of the Diocese of St. Thomas unanimously elected Father Thomas to serve as Diocesan Administrator, a post he filled from August 11, 1992 until he was named as the Third Bishop of the Virgin Islands on October 30, 1993. He was consecrated and installed at Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral on Sunday, December 12, 1993.

The   (or P.W.A.B.) is a fictional secret society in the Guilty Gear fighting game series, making its first appearance in Guilty Gear XX. It is the organization that created Robo-Ky, and changed Testament into a Gear.

 Background .
Very little is known of the organization, apart from the above. However, each character's Story Mode provides some hints as to their purpose.


The organization was founded during the war between humans and Gears; as its name implies, it was intended to manage the affairs of the human race once the war was over. However, the war's end saw no need for them, and it was supposed to have been disbanded. Instead, they merely retreated to the shadows.

The group demonstrably has access to relatively advanced technology, as it created Robo-Ky. However, its members can also use magic; an unidentified member of the group used a crystal ball to observe Jam Kuradoberi in one of her endings.

The purpose of the organization has apparently shifted entirely to maintaining its own power and influence, as well as its own secrecy, and its members are willing to go to any lengths to do so, evidently lacking any ethics in how they go about this. Its interest in each character seems focused on whether they should be manipulated, killed, captured, or studied, and each characters' Story Mode begins with the P.W.A.B.'s profile for that character, accompanied with a "risk rating" that apparently denotes how dangerous they are to the organization. Robo-Ky was created both to impersonate Ky Kiske and as an equalizer should they decide that direct confrontation is necessary.

"Nadia's Theme" is a piece of music composed by Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr. that currently serves as the theme music to the American soap opera The Young and the Restless.

The melody, originally called "Cotton's Dream," was written by De Vorzon and Botkin as incidental music for the 1971 theatrical film Bless the Beasts and Children. Two years later, Botkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece for The Young and the Restless; the show debuted on March 23, 1973. The melody was later renamed "Nadia's Theme" after the ABC television network set Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci's performance to that music during the 1976 Summer Olympics.

About one month after the 1976 Olympics, the song was released as a single by A&M Records. It soared to up to position number 8 on the Billboard Music Charts by December of 1976, in part because of its association with Comaneci. However, A&M Records failed to credit De Vorzon as the co-writer on the first pressings of the single; he successfully sued the record label for $241,000 USD.  Currently, the single has never been released on CD.

Other versions of "Nadia's Theme" have been recorded, including a semi-rock version by The Ventures, and  David Hasselhoff's rendition for his 1987 album Lovin' Feelings.

"Nadia's Theme" is sampled in Mary J. Blige's single No More Drama from her album with the same name. In the tune, Blige's persona describes herself as "young and restless".

PatrolBot is a programmable autonomous general purpose Service robot rover built by MobileRobots Inc. In various configurations, PatrolBots serve as bases for companies developing delivery robots, security robots, environmental monitoring rovers, guides and other indoor service robots.

 Capabilities of PatrolBot .

PatrolBot can scan buildings, create floor plans and navigate them autonomously using a laser range-finding sensor inside the robot. It employs Monte Carlo/Markov-style localization techniques and using a modified value-iterated search technique for navigation. It searches for alternative paths if a hall is blocked, circumnavigates obstacles and re-charges itself at its automated dock/charge station as needed. As a Wi-Fi device, it can operate autonomously or be controlled remotely.

 Applications .

PatrolBot is a robotic base used to integrate with security alarms, HVAC systems, electronic doors, elevators and other enterprise systems in a facility. It is programmable for custom applications, but also offers canned applications for surveillance, security, sensor monitoring, hazard detection and delivery.

Outfitted as a Surveillance PatrolBot, the device provides remote viewing and 2-way audio through camera, microphone and speakers. It can be controlled manually or autonomously from networked control stations. Intruders are visible by the path they leave as they walk, artifacts of the laser. A gas sensor reads oxygen, CO2 and H2S levels and can sound alarm on the robot and/or at the control station if acceptable levels are exceeded; likewise for smoke and temperature. PatrolBot is unique in that it is designed to have additional sensors, crates and devices added to it and to its GUI Control software.

PatrolBot can be sent to goals on demand or can patrol a sequence of goals. Status windows in the control GUI provide read-outs from the sensors as well as proprioceptive information such as battery levels. The robot's data logs are available for security and energy optimization.

Morton's neuroma (also known as  Morton's metatarsalgia, Morton's neuralgia, plantar neuroma and intermetatarsal neuroma) is a benign neuroma of the interdigital plantar nerve. 

This problem is characterised by numbness and pain, relieved by removing footwear.

Although it is labeled a "neuroma", many sources do not consider it a true tumor, but rather a thickening of existing tissue.

Symptoms and signs.
Symptoms include: pain on weight bearing, frequently after only a short time; the pain is felt as a shooting pain affecting the contiguous halves of two toes. Burning, numbness and parasthesia may also be experienced. Classically the 3rd digital space between the 3rd and 4th toes are affected, but the condition can occasionally occur in the 2nd and 3rd interdigital space. The pain is caused by pressure on the enlarged section of nerve where it passes between the metatarsal heads, and is squeezed between them. The first toe is never involved. Neuroma in the 4th/5th interdigital space is described, but is extremely rare. 

Negative signs include no obvious deformities, erythema, signs of inflammation or limitation of movement. Direct pressure between the metatarsal heads will replicate the symptoms, as will compression of the forefoot between the finger and thumb so as to compress the transverse arch of the foot

There are other causes of pain in the forefoot.  Too often all forefoot pain is categorized as neuroma.  Other conditions to consider are capsulitis, which is an inflammation of ligaments that surrounds two bones, at the level of the joint.  In this case it would the ligaments that attach the toe bone to the metatarsal bone.  Inflammation from this condition will put pressure on an otherwise healthy nerve and give neuroma type symptoms.
Additionally, an intermetatarsal bursitis between the third and fourth metatarsal bones will also give neuroma type symptoms because it too puts pressure on the nerve.

Since a neuroma is a soft tissue condition an MRI should be helpful in diagnosis, however, often an MRI will be inconclusive for neuroma even though a neuroma exists.

Moses Harris (1731 - 1785) was an English entomologist and engraver.

In the Natural System of Colours (1766) he examined the work of Isaac Newton and tried to reveal the multitude of colours which can be created from three basic ones. As a naturalist, Harris wished to understand the relationships between the colours, and how they are coded, and his book attempted to explain the principles, "materially, or by the painters art", by which further colours can be produced from red, yellow and blue. Harris showed what is now known as the subtractive mixing of colours, with his most important observation showing that black will be formed through the superimposition of the three basic colours.

Late Night with Butt-Head is an episode of the animated series Beavis and Butt-head, from the fourth season.

Synopsis.


Beavis and Butt-head are watching an episode of Late Show with David Letterman, which inspires Butt-head to come up with a similar show.  The duo visits the audio-visual department at school, where Mr. Van Driessen is apparently teaching a journalism class.  Butt-head explains to Van Driessen his idea, which the viewer sees in the form of a daydream of Butt-head as David Letterman and Beavis as Paul Shaffer.  The duo then proceed to do their own crude rendition of the show in a classroom as another student records it.

 Trivia .
The segment featuring the boys watching Letterman, in which his voice is actually featured, was cut out of the DVD release; the episode occasionally airs in its entirety on MTV2.

The Pacific viperfish, Chauliodus macouni, is a predatory fish living deep in the oceans and is frequently referred to as among the ocean's "bottom feeders." In daytime it can be found from 500 2500 m below the ocean surface. At night it swims up into shallower depths of less than 600m where food is more plentiful.  Pacific viperfish will mostly eat crustaceans and small fish. They typically reach lengths of up to 30 cm, however they can reach up to 2 m and are considered an example of deep-sea gigantism. It is believed that its first dorsal fin's photophores are used to attract prey.

Pacific viperfish can be characterized by its large mouth, long fang-like teeth and long dorsal fin ray (as much as half its body length). They are iridescent dark silver-blue color in life with pale fins.

<doc id="445017" title="M50 Reising submachine gun" nonfiltered="373" processed="370" dbindex="1480375">


The Reising was an American submachine gun patented in 1940 and manufactured by Harrington & Richardson. It was designed by Eugene Reising in 1940. The two versions of the weapon produced during World War II were the M50 and the simplified folding-stock M55.  Over 10,000 guns were ordered, and were initially used by the United States Navy and Marine Corps, though some went to Canadian, Soviet, and other forces.

Design.
Though described as a submachine gun, the Reising was actually designed as a compact lightweight semi-automatic carbine that was also capable of fully-automatic fire.  There were three versions of the Reising, the M50, M55, and the semi-automatic-only M60.
  
There were several differences between the M50 and the M55.  The most obvious one was the use of a rather flimsy, folding wire buttstock in the M55.  The latter also eliminated the flash suppressor and was simplified internally, making it lighter and shorter, with a reduced rate of fire. The M55 was originally issued to Marine parachute troops and armored vehicle crews.  The M60 was designed primarily for police use as a semi-automatic carbine.

History.
The Reising entered service primarily because of uncertainty of supply of sufficient quantities of the Thompson submachine gun. In the testing stage, it won out over some other candidates. It was very light and quite accurate in aimed fire, attributed to its better stock fit and intricate closed bolt design, though its firepower was more limited due to the 20-round capacity of its largest magazine. 

During WWII, quantities of the M50 Reising gun were issued to U.S. Marine Corps personnel deploying to the Pacific theatre, and were used in the Solomons campaign, including the battle for Guadalcanal. Most Reisings were originally issued to Marine officers and NCOs in lieu of a compact and light carbine, since the M1 Carbine was not yet being issued to the Marines.  Although the Thompson submachine gun was available, this weapon frequently proved too heavy and bulky for jungle patrols, and initially it too was in short supply. 

The Para-Marines were known to have been issued quantities of the folding-stock M55, but the weapon's poorly-designed wire-framed stock (which tended to collapse upon firing) soon earned the weapon a poor reputation.    

Unfortunately, the Reising was not suited to the stresses of harsh battle conditions encountered in the Solomon Islands   namely, the difficulty in keeping the weapon clean enough to function properly.  While more accurate than the Thompson, particularly in semi-auto fire, the Reising had a tendency to jam.  This was in part due to its overly complex locked-breech design. This design used a system of levers within the breech block, to release the firing pin, that rusted easily in jungle climates.  The Reising soon earned a dismal reputation for reliability. Reportedly, many Marines would throw the weapon away upon finding just about anything else, and one NCO reportedly 'decommissioned' his Reising by breaking the stock over the head of a particularly insolent 'brig rat'. Lt. Col. Merritt Edson, commanding officer of a Marine Raider battalion, ordered all Reising submachine guns issued to his unit to be dumped unceremoniously in a river, so that his men might draw better weapons.

After the Marines proved reluctant to accept more Reisings, and with the increased issue of the .30 M1 Carbine, the U.S. government passed some Reising submachine guns to the OSS and to various foreign governments (as Lend-Lease aid).  Others were given to various anti-Axis resistance forces operating around the world.  Many Reising guns (particularly the M60 variant) were also released to U.S. law enforcement and the National Guard for guarding war plants, bridges, and other strategic resources, and in this role the weapon proved more successful.

Variants.
Harrington & Richardson also made a long-barreled, semi-automatic version, known as the M60 carbine. However, few of these were sold. The Marines used M60s for training, guard duty and other non-combat roles. Some M60s were believed to have been issued to Marine officers at Guadalcanal.  The remaining guns were passed on to the National Guard and civilian law enforcement agencies.

Töölö (Swedish Tölö) is the collective name for the districts Etu-Töölö (Swedish Främre Tölö) and Taka-Töölö (Swedish Bortre Tölö) in Helsinki, Finland. The districts are located next to the city centre, occupying the western side of the Helsinki Peninsula.

Etu-Töölö, the southern district, borders Kamppi and is the location of the Finnish Parliament House. Taka-Töölö, the northern district, borders Meilahti and Laakso. Contrary to popular belief, Töölö is not the official name of any district in Helsinki.

Töölö was built in 1920-1930 when Helsinki suffered from rapid population growth and needed more housing. Before that, Töölö was full of farms and some forest.

Töölö has always been respected as a district and the prices of apartments are high especially in Etu-Töölö. It has many parks, including the big Töölönlahti (Gulf of Töölö). Töölö also has a vibrant culture. It has the National Opera, The National Museum Of Finland, Kunsthalle Helsinki, the Zoological Museum and many small galleries.

Notable sights.
Töölö has parks such as Sibelius-puisto, which has a monument to the composer Jean Sibelius. There are also other sights and buildings of architectural interest, as well as renowned hotels and restaurants in Töölö.

<doc id="7884430" title="Spires of Naples" nonfiltered="382" processed="379" dbindex="1480384">




The Spires of Naples ("spire" in Italian: guglia; plural, guglie) are three monument columns in the historic center of the city of Naples. The term "plague column" is commonly used in English for such structures since in many places in Europe such columns were built to celebrate the end of or deliverance from the plague. They were common in the Catholic countries of Europe especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, when their ornateness became one of the most visible features of Baroque architecture. The columns may also be termed "votive columns" or "votive spires" and may also be connected with calamities other than the plague, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, or may simply be manifestations of faith, atonement, or expiation. Such columns are generally surmounted by a statue of a religious personage. In Naples, the spires are named for the religious figure that tops them. In chronological order by date of completion, the spires are:


the Spire of San Gennaro, (started in 1636  and finished by 1650) in the square of Sisto Riario Sforza. It was the work of Cosimo Fanzago, perhaps the greatest architect of the Neapolitan Baroque. The spire was erected to celebrate the deliverance of the city from the great earthquake of 1631. ;


the Spire of San Domenico, located in the square of San Domenico Maggiore. The name refers to San Domenico di Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order. The spire was started after the plague of 1656; the designer, again, was Cosimo Fanzago. The work, itself, was undertaken by royal architect, Francesco Antonio Picchiati whose concern for documenting and preserving the great number of remains of the ancient Roman city of Neapolis beneath the site caused construction to be suspended in 1680 when the spire had reached only about half the height one sees today. It was finished by the architect Domenico Antonio Vaccaro in 1737 under Charles III, the first Bourbon monarch of Naples. By definition, this spire is the only true "plague column" of the three.


the Spire of the Immaculate Virgin, located in the center of the square of Piazza del Gesù Nuovo. It was erected in 1750 under Charles III after a building time of only three years. It was built at the behest of the king after he commented that the people should have some means of admiring the statue of the Immaculate Virgin without having to go into the church of Gesù (now called Gesù Nuovo) on the square, where the statue was contained. Jesuit Father Francesco Pepe refused royal patronage and financed the construction of the spire through public donations. The spire was designed by Giuseppe Genoino and the main sculptors were Matteo Bottiglieri and Francesco Pagano. The rich ornamentation of the spire is considered the epitome of Neapolitan Baroque sculpture.  Building was facilitated by the existence of a preexisting monument on the site, an equestrian statue of Philip V of Spain, partially destroyed in 1705 after the end of the Spanish vicerealm in Naples.    ;

<doc id="1096607" title="Feminist legal theory" nonfiltered="383" processed="380" dbindex="1480385">
Feminist legal theory is based on the belief that the law has been instrumental in women's historical subordination.  The project of feminist legal theory is twofold.  First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law plays a role in women's subordinate status. Second, feminist legal theory is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to gender.    

The four primary approaches to feminist jurisprudence are: the liberal equality model, the sexual difference model, the dominance model, and the postmodern or anti-essentialist model. Each model provides a distinct view of the legal mechanisms that contribute to women's subordination, and each offers a distinct method for changing legal approaches to gender.  

The liberal equality model operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice.  This model focuses on ensuring that women are afforded genuine equality as opposed to the nominal equality often given them in the traditional liberal framework and seeks to achieve this either by way of a more thorough application of liberal values to women s experiences or the revision of liberal categories to take gender into account.  Susan Okin, for example, has critiqued liberal approaches to justice for their complete neglect of gender and its injustice.  

The difference model emphasizes the significance of the differences between men and women and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it.  Only by taking into account differences can the law provide adequate remedies for women s situation, which is in fact distinct from men s.  The difference model is in direct opposition to the sameness account which holds that women s sameness to men should be emphasized. To the sameness feminist, employing women s differences in an attempt to garner greater rights is ineffective and places emphasis on the very characteristics of women that have historically precluded them from achieving equality to men.

The dominance model and its most notable proponent, Catharine MacKinnon, reject liberal feminism and view the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance.  Sexuality is central to MacKinnon s dominance account.  She argues that women s sexuality is socially constructed by male dominance and that women s subordination results primarily from the sexual dominance of women by men.  A major line of critique of the dominance model is that it leaves no room for women s agency since women are victims whose lives are fundamentally shaped by male dominance.  The difficulty of the dominance model is that it leaves little or no room for women s genuine autonomy or agency.

Feminists from the postmodern camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated.  Anti-essentialist and intersectionalist critiques of feminist jurisprudence have objected to the idea that there can be any universal women s voice and have criticized feminists for implicitly basing their work on the experiences of white, middle class, heterosexual women.  The anti-essentialist and intersectionalist project has been to explore the ways in which race, class, sexual orientation, and other axes of subordination interplay with gender and to uncover the implicit, detrimental assumptions that have often been employed in feminist theory.

BAMZOOKi is a Mixed Reality television gameshow on the BBC which features a toolkit developed by Gameware Development. The first series aired in March 2004 on CBBC. The show is currently presented by Jake Humphrey and Richard Webb.

 ZOOKs .

A ZOOK is an autonomous creature designed by users and contestants in the gameshow. Created using 3D primitives, ZOOKs move autonomously based on IK points that the designer assigns to them.

Using nature as inspiration, contestants design ZOOKs to compete against other ZOOKs in a variety of competitions. The tool kit for designing ZOOKs is offered for download on the show's website. Also, more recently, two new ZOOK-Kit features have been released that allow users to simulate the TV contests and then replay their ZOOKs' performances from multiple angles.

Gameware's Creature Labs team uses artificial life programming techniques to provide the ZOOKs' autonomous movement and behaviour and integrates this with the BBC's virtual studio system to enable real-time visualisations in a studio setting.

 In more detail... .
The toolkit, the BAMZOOKi Zook Kit, enables users to build virtual creatures, ZOOKs, and test them in a realtime physically simulated environment. Kids used this software to build ZOOKs which were submitted to the BBC. Teams were selected and invited into the studio to enter their ZOOKs in various contests from bowling to hurdles.

The software is still freely available from the BBC site along with the manual. Although designed to be easy enough to be used by kids, it is highly flexible and versatile. Zooks are built from the bottom-up with elemetary component parts that the user shapes and sticks together. Users are not restricted to particular body designs or topologies, although the control system uses a standard Braitenberg architecture.

The BBC's Virtual Studio technology was used to enable realtime composition of the 3D rendered graphics with live camera feeds. Each studio camera has a dedicated render PC to render the virtual scene from that camera's perspective. To know what a studio camera's perspective is, each camera is fitted with a second 'Free-D' camera which points towards the ceiling. On the ceiling are reflective, circular bar codes. The Free-D camera data is fed to a computer system that identifies the targets on the ceiling and calculates that camera's position and orientation, 50 times a second.

The contest runs in realtime on a networked PC. All the clients receive contest scene information and render their scene from their studio camera's point of view. A bank of chromakey boxes then composite the virtual and the live feed together to provide a realtime composite. This video stream can be sent to the studio camera monitors so that camera operators can view the composite and hence follow the action in realtime.

There is a non-children's user-base establishing itself, using the toolkit (a modified version of the Bonsai artificial life program) for their own purposes.

Presently when you download the Zook Kit it comes with the Simulator ( for doing chalenges like on TV ) and the Motion Player to watch your battles from the Simulator.

A Kebab rat is a pejorative term used in the East End of London to describe unclean vermin meat that has been processed to form döner kebab meats. Since the processing and production of meat for consumption as kebabs is normally limited to lamb, beef, chicken or occasionally fish, the use of vermin meat is considered unsafe and in many countries illegal. The vermin meat is supposedly ground and mixed with proper meats before being processed into the large slab of meat which is fed onto a vertical spindle and grilled before being served.

The term originated in a local newspaper, the Hackney Gazette in 2003, in an article covering the closure of a kebab house in Tottenham, although it is likely it had already entered popular use by locals beforehand to describe the products of disreputable meat preparation companies and slaughterhouses.

As of 2005, there have been no known instances of food preparation companies being closed or prosecuted due to the use of vermin meat in edible products in London, which might suggest that the term is unwarranted and potentially slanderous. It is believed that reports of food poisoning from local kebab shops become distorted and foster this urban myth.

In the UK selling rodent meat in kebabs is likely to be incompatible with current Meat Regulations and would likely require a Novel food pre-market safety assessment under european legislation should a kebab shop wish to sell it legally.

Jetton graduated from Charleston High School in 1986. He attended Cape Girardeau public schools from 6th to 9th grade but transferred during his freshman year when his father became pastor of Southside Baptist Church in Charleston. He was a four-year letterman on the cross country and track teams, and set the school two mile record with a time of 9:52. He enjoys music and singing and he played Sky Masterson in the school musical Guys and Dolls his senior year. He was also the senior class treasurer.
     
Jetton was awarded a college scholarship for cross country and track to attend Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri. He graduated in May 1990, with a double major in history and political science. He was a 4-year letterman and captain of the cross country and track teams.  His first interest in politics started in student government where he was elected to several offices ending his service as the Student Body President his senior year.
     
Jetton joined the United States Marine Corps and served as an Infantry Officer for four years. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was involved in the Bosnia and Somalia operations. After finishing his tour in 1995, Rod received an honorable discharge.

After leaving the Marine Corps, Rod started Jetton James Real Estate Company with his father-in-law.

Public service.

After college, Jetton joined Congressman Bill Emerson's campaign team as a field coordinator, and gained valuable experience in local grass roots politics.  In 1996, he was elected to the Bollinger County Commission as the youngest County Commissioner in the state at that time. Bollinger County remained in the black during his term.  Jetton held town hall meetings throughout the district and wrote a column in the newspaper.
     
In 2000, Jetton was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives where he has served since 2001. In his second term, he was chosen Speaker Pro Tem of the Missouri House. On January 5, 2005, he was sworn in as the 70th Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives.

Jetton states that his priorities include improving the economic climate in the state, reform of a runaway legal system, ensuring quality medical care for all Missourians and giving every child an excellent education.  He asserts that he is working to bring a more bi-partisan environment to the legislature, and has changed the legislative process to make sure everyone's voices are heard.

Jetton is a member of New Salem Baptist Church, Chamber of Commerce, Optimist Club, Christian Coalition, VFW Post 5900, Farm Bureau, National Rifle Association and National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The Bollinger County Chamber of Commerce gave him the "One Year VIP Business Achievement Award" in 1998 for his leadership and service to the community.
     
Family.

In 1988, Jetton married Cassie James.  Together they are raising three children, Callie, Elaine and Will. Cassie has been a full partner with Rod in caring for the household and the children when he was away on deployments while in the Marine Corps. Now that Rod is serving the public, she manages the apprasial company and has been instrumental in its success.

Go Home Lake is a lake in west central Ontario in the Township of Georgian Bay, District of Muskoka. Fur traders would meet on Go Home Lake at the end of the season to "go home", hence the name. Go Home Lake is approximately 5 miles long and ranges from a 1/2 to 3/4 miles wide. Its length runs in a north-south orientation. The lake is fed at its most northern point by the Moon River. Go Home Lake empties into the Gibson River at the south end of the lake as well as into the Go Home River at the north end of the lake. Both The Gibson River and the Go Home River empty into Georgian Bay. Go Home Lake was opened up and divided into lots which were sold beginning in 1958-59. Go Home Lake is considerably more rugged and rockier than other Muskoka lakes. Both the "New Cut" (a man made channel), and the "Haunted Narrows" link the south end of the lake to the north.     The "Haunted Narrows" received its name from the eerie sound caused by the movement of rocks on the bottom of the channel that can be heard in the dead of night.

The Nissan Pao is a retro-styled automobile from Nissan Motors. It was produced as an enclosed hatchback or open canvas-topped convertible. The Pao was one of three fashionable spinoffs of the K10 Micra   the Figaro and Be-1 being the other two. Like the Figaro, the Pao was sold without the Nissan name, by reservation from January 15 through April 14, 1989.

The engine was the 1.0 L (987 cc) MA10S, and a 3-speed automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission was also supplied.  This engine produced 52 PS (51 hp/38 kW) at 6000 rpm and 76 N·m (56 ft·lbf) at 3600 rpm.

It was designed as a fashionable city car in the mold of the Figaro, requiring just 4.4 m (14.4 ft) to turn around and delivering up to 43 mpg (5.5 L/100 km) in the city and 69 mpg (3.4 L/100 km) at a steady 60 km/h (37 mph).

The chassis included rack and pinion steering, independent suspension with struts in front and 4-links and coil springs in back.  Disc brakes were used all around.

 Outline and features .

(Rough interpretation from a document translated from Japanese)

Summary and features for type E-PK10. The pike is the K10 and also type March. 

Always designed to produce a feeling of a car that is different, it has the taste of being on holiday while being practical for everyday driving in the city. Naturalness (meaning a lack of obvious use of computer-aided design) and an impression of good quality were wanted along with making you fall in love with it. Remeniscent of an Austin A-40 Farina of the late 1960s, the very first hatchback in the world.

Designed to express the true heart of the city it is based on a 2-box design. The appearance is both eye-catching and simple, warm but very cool.

Some panels are made from (injection molding) the thermoplastic resin, others from SMC formation resin (FPR) the thermosetting metaplasia resin using Japanese engineered stiffening ribs for the bonnet. These lightweight parts used with the single sided processing steel sheet also improves corrosion resistance substantially, overall strength and rigidity.

Rust prevention is further enhanced by the used of electronic rustproofing in hollow areas, filling spaces with rust-prevention wax, and the use of processes which raise the adhesion properties of the paint

Senegal has well-trained and disciplined armed forces consisting of about 19,000 personnel in the army, air force, navy, and gendarmerie. The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale. Military noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the Democratic Republic of Congo to participate in MONUC, the United Nations peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a U.S.-trained battalion to Sierra Leone to participate in UNAMSIL, another UN peacekeeping mission. A Senegalese contingent deployed on a peacekeeping mission to the Central African Republic in 1997, and in 1994, Senegal sent a battalion-sized force to Rwanda to participate in the UN peacekeeping mission there. In 1992 Senegal sent 1,500 men to the ECOMOG peacekeeping group in Liberia, and in 1991, it was the only Sub-Saharan nation to send a contingent to participate in Operation Desert Storm. In August 1981, the Senegalese military was invited into The Gambia by President Dawda Kairaba Jawara to put down a coup attempt. In August 1989, Senegalese-Gambian military cooperation, which began with the joint Senegalese-Gambian efforts during the 1981 coup attempt, ceased with the dissolution of the Senegambian Confederation. Senegal intervened in the Guinea-Bissau civil war in 1998 at the request of former President Vieira.

<doc id="40365" title="Galvanometer" nonfiltered="395" processed="392" dbindex="1480397">



A galvanometer is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current. It is an electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The name galvanometer has been applied to devices used in measuring, recording, and positioning equipment.

 Operation .

The most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument, often called a meter. It is used to measure the direct current (flow of electric charges) through an electric circuit.  Such devices are constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet.  The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale.  A tiny spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.  In some meters, the magnetic field acts on a small piece of iron to perform the same effect as a spring.

When a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field.  This field acts with or against the permanent magnet.  The coil pivots, pushing against the spring, and moving the pointer.  The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. A useful meter generally contains some provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer so that the pointer position smoothly tracks the current without excess vibration.


The basic sensitivity of a meter might be, for instance, 100 microamperes full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called shunts, allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in  series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously-unknown resistor.

Because the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale of the meter, parallax error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that "lines up" with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal scale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by moving the head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must be directly above the pointer and any parallax error has been minimized.

 Types . 

Extremely sensitive measuring equipment once used mirror galvanometers that substituted a mirror for the pointer.  A beam of light reflected from the mirror acted as a long, massless pointer. Such instruments were used as receivers for early trans-Atlantic telegraph systems, for instance. The moving beam of light could also be used to make a record on a moving photographic film, producing a graph of current versus time, in a device called an oscillograph.

Galvanometer mechanisms are used to position the pens of analog chart recorders such as used for making an electrocardiogram. Strip chart recorders with galvanometer driven pens might have a full scale frequency response of 100 Hz and several centimeters deflection. In some cases (the classical polygraph of movies or the electroencephalograph), the galvanometer is strong enough to move the pen while it remains in contact with the paper; the writing mechanism may be a heated tip on the needle writing on heat-sensitive paper or a fluid-fed pen. In other cases (the Rustrak recorders), the needle is only intermittently pressed against the writing medium; at that moment, an impression is made and then the pressure is removed, allowing the needle to move to a new position and the cycle repeats. In this case, the galvanometer need not be especially strong.

 Uses .

Mirror galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning elements in laser optical systems. These are typically high power galvanometer mechanisms used with closed loop servo control systems. They can have frequency responses over 1 kHz.

Galvanometers have been replaced as measuring instruments by analog to digital converters (ADC) for most uses. There are, for instance, self contained digital measuring systems, called digital panel meters (DPMs), available to replace most traditional analog meter functions.

 History .

The term "galvanometer" derives from the surname of Luigi Galvani. Many early applications of galvanometers for measuring and recording are associated with William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). The earliest galvanometer was reported by Johann (Johan) Schweigger of Nuremberg at the University of Halle on 16th September 1820. André-Marie Ampère also contributed to the development of the galvanometer.

Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park is a national park in southern Mongolia.  The park was established in 1993, and expanded to its current size in 2000.  The park, at nearly 27,000 square kilometers, is the largest national park in Mongolia.

The park is named for the Gurvansaikhan Mountains, which translates to the Three Beauties.  The name is derived from three subranges, the East, Middle and West Beauty.  The range forms the eastern half of the park.

The park lies on the northern edge of the Gobi desert.  The higher elevations contain areas of steppe.  A number of rare plants and animals are found in the park, including the elusive snow leopard.  Areas of sand dunes are found, most famously the Khongoryn Els - the Singing Sands.  Another major tourist destination is Yoliin Am, a mountain valley that contains a large ice field through most of the year.

The park is usually accessed via the town Dalanzadgad, which has airport service to Ulaanbaatar.

stic.man (born Clayton Gavin, 1975, Shadeville, Florida, USA) is a rapper, activist and author known for his work as one half of the political hip-hop duo dead prez.  He is known largely for their hard-hitting style and politically active lyrics, focusing on racism, critical pedagogy, activism against governmental hypocrisy, and corporate control over the media, especially hip-hop record labels. dead prez made their stance clear on their first album, declaring on the lead song, "I'm a African" that the group is "somewhere between N.W.A. and P.E.".

He used to relax on the campus of FAMU though he was never enrolled for classes. There he and M-1 met and connected due to their mutual love of music and knowledge.  The two comrades' growing sense of Black pride and political theory served as a common bond as they joined various community groups, eventually forming dead prez as a rap group and moving to New York. After a chance meeting with Brand Nubian's Lord Jamar at a Brooklyn block party, the duo signed a recording deal with Loud Records, which released Let's Get Free. But even before the release of the record, dead prez amassed a strong and loyal underground following through their explosive live shows, ardent community organizing and top notch unreleased material.

"I don't really consider myself no producer, but I have fun trying to make music that I wanna hear," confesses stic. "We work with live musicians as well as beat machines. We lay the foundation. We might lay some drums, and then build, either getting samples or some type of rhythm in the instruments, or we might come up with a melody. A lot of times the melody is he first thing for me in terms of creating a song. I just start singing some shit and then we start". 

In 2006 stic.man demonstrated his writing talents with two books. The first, entitled Warrior Names from Afrika, is a compilation of African warrior names and their meanings. His second book, The Art of Emcee-ing, is a 112-page resource that offers a step-by-step instructional guide on how to emcee, unique tips on voice healing and vocal health practices, and an explanation on many aspects of the hip hop industry, including terminology, styles, and business dealings. About.com described the book as a "succinct panoramic guide on hip-hop wordsmithing." 

stic.man also maintains Boss Up, Inc., an "Atlanta-based music and entertainment company that offers information, music, and gear that reflects a sense of self-determination, creative consciousness, and entrepreneurship."

James Alfred Farr (born Friday, May 18, 1956 in Waverly, New York) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Texas Rangers in 1982. He was 6 ft 1 in, 195 pounds, and he threw and batted right handed. Farr attend Penn State University.

Farr was drafted three times before signing with a team. In 1974, the Chicago White Sox took him in the 9th round of the June Regular Phase amateur entry draft. In 1977, the San Francisco Giants took him in the 15th round of the June Regular Phase amateur entry draft. Finally, in 1978, the Texas Rangers took him in the 29th round of the June Regular Phase amateur entry draft.

On September 7 1982 at the age of 26 and wearing the number 33, Farr made his Major League debut. He appeared in a total of 5 games in the 1982 season, pitching a total of 18 innings and collecting a good ERA of 2.50. One of the knocks against him-and this may have limited his time in the Major Leagues-was his lack of control. In those 18 innings pitched, Farr threw one wild pitch, walked 13, and struck out only 12. One wild pitch pitch every 18 innings might not seem like a lot, but when comparing him to pitchers like Carlos Silva-who did not throw a single wild pitch in over 188 innings of work in 2005-it is a fairly large amount. 

Less than one month after his debut-on October 3, 1982, Farr pitched his final Major League game.

John Richard Archer (8 June, 1863 July, 1932) was a British race and political activist. In November 1906, he and Sylvester Williams became the first people of African descent to be elected to public office in Britain, with Archer becoming a councillor and later Mayor in Battersea.

Archer was born to Richard Archer, from Barbados, and Mary Teresa Burns, from Ireland, in Liverpool. He travelled the world as a seaman, living in the USA and Canada, then settled in Battersea with his wife, Bertha, a black Canadian. He ran a small photographic studio at a time when photography was in its infancy.

Archer became involved in local politics and friendly with London radicals. In 1906 he was elected as a Liberal to Battersea Borough Council for Latchmere ward; at the same time, Williams won in Marylebone. He successfully campaigned for a minimum wage of 32 shillings a week for council workers and was re-elected in 1912. In 1913, he was nominated for the position of Mayor. There were negative, even racist, aspects to the campaign, with allegations that he did not have British nationality. He won by 40 votes to 39 and gave a notable victory speech:

"My election tonight means a new era. You have made history tonight. For the first time in the history of the English nation a man of colour has been elected as mayor of an English borough.

"That will go forth to the coloured nations of the world and they will look to Battersea and say Battersea has done many things in the past, but the greatest thing it has done has been to show that it has no racial prejudice and that it recognises a man for the work he has done.";

Archer moved to the left during his years in Battersea and was re-elected to the Council as a Labour representative in 1919. He stood without success for parliament the same year. In 1918 he became President of the African Progress Union, working for black empowerment and equality.
In 1919 he was a British delegate to the Pan-African Congress in Paris. Two years later he chaired the Pan-African Congress in London. 

In 1922, Archer acted as Labour Party secretary election agent for Shapurji Saklatvala, a Communist activist standing for parliament in North Battersea. He convinced the Labour Party to endorse Saklatvala and he was duly elected one of the first black MPs in Britain. He and Saklatvala continued to work together, winning again in 1924 until the Communist and Labour parties split fully. In 1929, Archer was agent for the official Labour candidate who won in the general election, beating Saklatvala.

Archer served as a governor of Battersea Polytechnic, President of the Nine Elms Swimming Club, Chair of the Whitley Council Staff Committee and a member of the Wandsworth Board of Guardians.
At the time of his death in 1932, he was deputy leader of Battersea council. He died on Thursday 14 July 1932, just a few weeks after his 69th birthday. His funeral was held at the Church of Our Lady of Carmel in Battersea Park Road on Tuesday 19 July, and was buried in the Council s cemetery at Morden.

In 2004, John Archer was chosen for the 100 Great Black Britons list, coming 72nd in a public vote.

The Clue in the Diary is a 1932 novel featuring Nancy Drew, a fictional character who has appeared in many other novels. It was reissued in 1962.

This is the last manuscript Mildred Wirt Benson wrote in her initial run. Benson would return for volume 11, The Clue of the Broken Locket, and remain with the series until 1948, returning for one last ghostwrite in 1953.

Plot summary.

The Clue in the Diary introduces Ned Nickerson, an admirer of Nancy for life. Nancy and her friends Bess and George, on the way home from a carnival, discuss a struggling Swedish immigrant, Mrs. Swenson, and her daughter. The girls helped the underprivileged duo to better enjoy the attractions (paid for things).

As they are driving, a luxurious roadside estate bursts into flames.  The girls park the car and make sure that no one is trapped inside. In doing so, Nancy sees someone fleeing the property, and discovers an anonymous Swedish diary on the ground. She picks up this clue, and as firefighters and viewers arrive on the scene, notes an attractive young man moving her car away from the flying embers. At first suspicious, Nancy warms to him when he helps her out of a jamb. Meanwhile, Mrs. Swenson's husband is missing, and she identifies that his diary is the one picked up at the fire. To top it all off, the owner of the burned house, Felix Raybolt is missing, and his wife claims Joe Swenson has murdered her husband. Raybolt, it turns out, swindles creative inventors like Swenson out of patents and copyrights on their inventions and used an invention to start the fire.

1962 edition.

The 1962 volume tells essentially the same story, eliminating some detail and subplots, and adding a new, very quickly resolved subplot involving mail fraud. (Many series fans question the addition of a mail fraud subplot, which appears trite in this case. By 1962, this plot device existed in both Nancy's Mysterious Letter and The Hidden Window Mystery.) Nancy struggles to decipher the diary and find the two missing men, aided by her best friends, and a new friend for life, Ned Nickerson.

The cover art for this book has not changed since 1950, when the revision art was introduced by Bill Gillies.

<doc id="5856556" title="Maerad" nonfiltered="409" processed="405" dbindex="1480412">
Maerad is the principal character of the first two books of Pellinor: The Gift, and The Riddle by the fantasy writer Alison Croggon.

Birth and early life.


Maerad was born into the Inner Circle of the School of Pellinor, the daughter of the first Bard, Milana, and her husband, Dorn, a member of the nomadic Pilanel race. She is a member of the House of Karn, which was virtually destroyed in the sack of Pellinor. As they attempted escape, the young Maerad and her mother were betrayed by the corrupt Enkir, later first Bard of Norloch and were sold into slavery to the petty feudal tyrant Gilman. Though thought to have perished along with Dorn, her brother Cai survived and was stolen by Bards who have turned from the Light, known as Hulls, the undead servants of the Nameless One, Sharma, who seeks to keep the Treesong split and hidden from the Elementals.

In the belief that Cai was in fact thought to be the Foretold, he was taken by the Hulls (whom he refers to as Black Bards) to an orphanage, where they attempted to corrupt him to the Dark. They changed Cai's name to Hem, to better reflect his new life in the North, as this is a common name amongst the Pilani.

The Gift.

Meanwhile, Maerad and her mother lived at Gilman's Cot, as slaves. Weakened by her broken spirit, Milana died before Maerad reached puberty, and she lived alone, fulfilling her duties from then onwards. Though she was a vulnerable girl, she appears to have managed to avoid the more harsh and degrading punishments meted out to female slaves as even as an untrained Bard she was considered to be witch-like and capable of placing the "evil eye" on those who sought to treat her roughly. When Cadvan of Lirigon came through the Cot, ensorcelled in a glimmerspell to hide him, Maerad saw him, and he realised that she was an untrained Bard. He agreed to assist her escape from Gilman and took her to the School of Innail, where Maerad learns of her heritage for the first time and begins her training in Bardic studies. She is also loved by Dernhil of Gent, a scholar, who subsequently voluntarily sacrifices his life to ensure Hulls in the service of Enkir are unable to persue Cadvan and Maerad out of Innail.

During Cadvan and Maerad's journey to the Annaren capital, Norloch, they enter the realm of Ardina, an Elemental being who rules the idyllic forest-realm of Rachida, and learn of Maerad's Elemental blood. Upon their exit from Rachida, they rescue a small boy named Hem as he seeks to hide from Hulls in the Valverras waste who had murdered the Pilani travellers who had rescued him. After much talk, they realise they are brother and sister, and that they belong to the illustrious house of Pellinor.

With the assistance of Dernhil's research, Cadvan uncovers Maerad's destiny as the Foretold One: she who will wrest the Treesong back into the Light and worst the Nameless One even in his greatest uprising. It is in the city of Norloch Cadvan's mentor, Nelac confirms this to be the case as he initiates Maerad as a full Bard, whereupon her truename is revealed to be that prophecised, Elednor, the Fire-Lily of Edil-Amarandh. It is here that Maerad also encounters Enkir, now first bard of Norloch and is forced to flee with Cadvan to the Island nation of Thorold. She also comes into the speech which allows her to converse fully with other Bards and animals, including her horse, Imi and Cadvan's stallion, Darsor.

The Riddle.

Further signs are given in Thorold that something is wrong at the heart of the Light, when the Rite of Renewal nearly fails and is only completed at the timely intervention of Cadvan and that Maerad's role in this is more complicated than that of a normal Bard. We are also given the first inidcation that she is susceptible to the temptations of the Dark and she is warned that her greatest danger my be to herself. We are also told of the split-song and how the Treesong was split by Sharma, the Nameless One in his attempt to become immortal in a similar manner to the Elementals, who owned the Treesong. In order to prevail against the Dark and the Nameless, Cadvan and Maerad must journey north to uncover the secret of the Treesong.

Surviving an attack at sea by a Stormdog, a weather creature created by the Winterking Arkan, the journey North sees a deterioration in the relationship between Cadvan and Maerad. This is further exacerbated when She accidentally kills Ilar of Lirigon, a bard of Cadvan's School who attempts to take them into custody after they are named as outlaws by Enkir. This is taken by Cadvan to be a sign of Maerad's seduction by the Dark and her elemental powers, and when they are attacked in the mountain passes by the servants of the Winterking, Maerad is distressed to find she is no longer able to join her own power to that of Cadvan, which seemingly results in his death in an avalanche (in fact Darsor has saved both Cadvan and himnself by bolting into a cave in the side of the mountain).

Rescued by Ardina, the dying Maerad is tended by Mirka, a mountain woman and a member of the Pilani. Upon her recovery Maerad journeys to the Pilani cpaital, Murask where she is introduced to more long-lost family, Sirkana their leader, who is revealed to be her Father's twin sister, and her cousin, Dharin. Dharin is tasked with taking Maerad to the Fire Islands to consult the Wise Kindred regarding the Treesong. Following her meeting with their Singer, she is captured by Jusaack raiders, in the service of an Elemental, the Winterking Arkan, and taken to his stronghold, Arkan-da, where she is enchanted and kept beneath his sway, as he thinks to keep her with him, forever enchanted to be his Queen. Though he is in some ways cold and cruel, Maerad find the Elemental part of her attracted to Arkan, and her hatred of him is tempered when she discovers he has been betrayed by the Nameless and does not consider himself Sharma's ally. In her conversations with the Winterking she learns that her lyre, which belonged to her mother Milana, bears runes which form one half of the treesong. Although Arkan can tell her what they mean, he is unable to reveal the music of the Treesong. It is believed that Sharma, the nameless, has the other half of the song in his domain of Den Raven in the south. 

Ardina helps Maerad to escape in the form of a Wolf, which she transforms into using her Elemental powers, simulataneously creating a semblance of herself to confuse Arkan. Together they escape the fury of Arkan who unleashes a terrible storm upon them, and journey with a wolf pack to the Annaren border. Still in wolf form, she is drawn back to the destroyed city of Pellinor where she finds Cadvan and Darsor camping among the ruins, having been told by Ardina to await her return there. She assumes human form again - much to Cadvan's surprise, and they resume their quest.



Since the third book in the series, The Crow, deals with Hem's journey to the south with the Bard Saliman, we expect to take up Maerad's story once more in the final instalment, The Singing.

Appearance.

Maerad is of average height. Unlike her brother, Hem, she is more Annaren than Pilani in appearance, with Pale skin, long black hair and blue eyes. She is roughly 16-17 years of age.

Since her kidnap and capture by the Winterking in the events of The Riddle, she has only 3 fingers on her left hand, the result of frostbite in the frozen wastes of Zamarkan.

Powers and Abilities.
Some members of the House of Karn have Elidhu blood, and as such their skill, proficiency and raw power at Bardic Magic and Magery is extremely high. The power of Pellinor allows Maerad to have incredible strength at magery, and she has used her skills in several feats. She has:
Created a living lion from a rock (never before done by a mortal);
Held up against an attack from a pure Elidhu, the Landrost;
Aided in the creation of powerful magics that was impossible before her arrival,
Seen through the Illusory Veil cast by the Arkan, the Winterking Elidhu,
Located her brother Hem in the Valverras Waste;
Killed a Kulag, and;
Simultaeneously defeated several Hulls and a Wight of the Abyss single-handedly.
She can also speak  Annaren, and both the Speech, and the language of the Elidhu.
Under the encouragement of Ardina, she has also learnt to alter her shape, spending several days as a member of a Wolf Pack in order to escape from the Winterking.

Possessions.
Due to her period as a slave, Maerad owns very few possessions. What she does have are kept in her travelling pack and include:
A mystical Lyre, thought to be Dhyllic ware created by Nelsor of Afinil. This is inscribed with ancient Runes which form one half of the Treesong.
A book of poems given to her by Dernhil of Gent;
Ring given to her by Ardina ;
Prior to her imprisonment in Arkan-da, her sword and helm.
A coat of chainmail.
A set of Elidhu pipes.

<doc id="8294882" title="Petro Kassui Kibe" nonfiltered="411" processed="407" dbindex="1480414">
Petro Kassui Kibe (1587 - July 4, 1639) was a Japanese Christian during 17th century and a Jesuit priest.  Before reaching Rome, he became the first Japanese to visit Jerusalem.  After he came back to Japan, he was martyred.  He saw the largest part of the world in medieval Japanese.  He is called "Japanese Marco Polo" or "A Christian walking thru the world".

Life.
For Rome.
In 1568, Petro Kibe was born in Kibe, Kunisaki in Bungo (At present, Kibe Kunimi-town Kunisaki-city Oita prefecture), Japan.  His parents were both Christians.  He started to learn at a seminaryo, a theological school, at age of 13.  In 1606, he aspired to be a Jesuit and began to tell his name "Kassui".  It is not known why he named himself "Kassui".  Since then his name had been described "Petro Kassui Kibe" in Jesuit documents.

In 1614, he was exiled to Macau due to a deportation order of Christians.  He learned Latin and theology at a theological school in Macau.  However, he and other Japanese knew it would be hard to be priests because of nationality discrimination, so they left the school to go to Rome.

He went to Malacca and Goa in India by ship, and then Kibe left for Europe on foot via Persia.  Via Hormuz and Baghdad, he finally became the first Japanese Christian to arrive at Jerusalem.  It took three years to arrive at Rome beyond the Mediterranean Sea after a difficult journey.  

From Macau, a letter telling "Japanese who left Macau would go to Rome, but don't talk to them." was sent to Rome.  However in Rome, Jesuits examined Kibe and found out he had enough knowledge and was suited for a priest.  On November 15, 1620, he became a Jesuit priest at age of 32 at the Basilica of St. John Lateran.

Afterward, he was trained at Jesuit training school for two years in Rome, and then he swore as a Jesuit priest in Lisbon.  In 1623, he departed for India with twenty Jesuits.  Next year, he arrived at Goa via Cape of Good Hope.

Return to Home.

Father Kibe had a strong decision of returning to Japan with taking the risk of being a martyr though Japan oppressed Christians and Christian priests' entry to Japan was forbidden.  He had a very hard time of finding a ship which allowed the Christian priest to board.  He traveled around Southeast Asia, and then finally he succeeded to get on a ship from Manila to Japan in 1630.  The ship wrecked, but reached Kagoshima in southern Japan.  He returned to Japan sixteen years after he left home.

Father Kibe hid himself and escaped from severe oppression and exposure.  He went to northeast Japan via Nagasaki and encouraged Christians.  In 1639, he was found out when he hid himself at home of a Christian and was arrested.  He was sent to Edo (Tokyo at present).  He met Christovao Ferreira who had already rejected his faith of Christianity, but Kibe strongly recommended Ferreira to return to the faith.  Father Kibe was tortured severely, but he never rejected his faith.  He still encouraged another Christian even in a hole for torturing to death, so he was pulled out of the hole then beheaded to be martyred.  He was 52 years old.  He looked at the world and lived a stormy life.

In Kibe Kunimi-town Kunisaki-city Oita prefecture, there is Father Kibe Memorial Park which was founded by Father Sekki.  Kibe's statute which is made by Yasutake Funakoshi stands at the park.  On May 7th, 2006, Roman Curio Congregation for the Causes of Saints decided Father Kibe and other 187 Japanese Christians who martyred should be celebrated.  It means an informal decision of canonization; therefore he will be canonized in the future.

<doc id="1963943" title="William James Mayo" nonfiltered="412" processed="408" dbindex="1480415">


William James Mayo (June 29, 1861   July 28, 1939) was a physician in the United States and a co-founder of the Mayo Clinic.  He was born to William Worrall Mayo and his wife Louise in Le Sueur, Minnesota.

The United States Postal Service printed a stamp depicting him and his brother, Charles Horace Mayo, on September 11, 1964.

Early years.
As a child, William and his brother Charles frequently accompanied their father as he went about his business as a pioneer physician. They began by helping out with very menial tasks, and were gradually given more responsibility. Eventually, the boys were acting as anesthesiologists and tying off blood vessels. 

On a stormy night at the age of 16, Will accompanied his father to an abandoned hotel where one of the elder Mayo's patients worked as the caretaker. The patient had just died and Dr. Mayo was going to perform an autopsy.  Will stood by and watched the procedure and after about an hour, it was time to go to another patient's home. Dr. Mayo asked his son to stay behind and clean up.  "Sew up the incisions and then tuck the sheet around the corpse. When you finish, go right home." Will nervously began to stitch up the incisions on the body and recounted the incident many years later saying, "I'm about as proud of the fact that I walked out, instead of ran, as of anything else I ever made myself do."

Education and professional work.
Mayo earned his medical degree from the University of Michigan in 1883. Afterwards he returned to Rochester to practice medicine along side his father and his brother Charles. 

On August 21, 1883, a terrible tornado struck Rochester, killing 24 people and seriously injuring over 40 others.  One-third of the town was destroyed, but young Dr. Will and his family escaped serious harm.  The relief efforts began immediately with a temporary hospital being established at the town's dance hall. The Mayo Drs. were extensively involved in treating the injured who were brought there for help. Mother Alfred Moes and the Sisters of Saint Francis were called in to act as nurses (despite the fact they were trained as teachers and had little if any medical experience).

After the crisis had subsided, Mother Alfred Moes approached William Worrall Mayo about establishing a hospital in Rochester.  On September 30, 1889, the dream became reality as Saint Mary's Hospital opened its doors. Dr. W.W. Mayo (who by this time was 70 years of age) became the consulting physician and surgeon at the hospital, and his two sons, began seeing patients and performing surgery with the assistance of the Sisters of Saint Francis.

In mathematics, a hyperbolic link is a link in the 3-sphere with complement that has a complete Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature, i.e. has a hyperbolic geometry.  A hyperbolic knot is a hyperbolic link with one component.

As a consequence of the work of William Thurston, it is known that every knot is precisely one of the following: hyperbolic, torus knot, satellite knot.  As a consequence, hyperbolic knots can be considered plentiful.  A similar heuristic applies to hyperbolic links.  

As a consequence of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, performing Dehn surgeries on a hyperbolic link enables one to obtain many more hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

Examples.
Every non-split, prime, alternating link that is not a torus link is hyperbolic by a result of William Menasco.

<doc id="191400" title="Michael Servetus" nonfiltered="418" processed="414" dbindex="1480421">


Michael Servetus (also Miguel Servet or Miguel Serveto; 29 September, 1511   27 October, 1553) was a Spanish theologian, physician and humanist.

His interests included many sciences: astronomy and meteorology; geography, jurisprudence, study of the Bible, mathematics, anatomy, and medicine. He is renowned in the history of several of these fields, particularly medicine and theology.

He participated in the Protestant Reformation, and later developed an anti-trinitarian theology.  Condemned by Catholics and Protestants alike, he was burnt at the stake by order of the Geneva governing council as a heretic.

Early life and education.
Servetus was born in Villanueva de Sijena, Huesca, Spain, in 1511 (probably on September 29, his patron saint's day), although no specific record exists. Some sources give an earlier date based on Servetus' own occasional claim of being born in 1509. His paternal ancestors came from the hamlet of Serveto, in the Aragonian Pyrenees, which gave the family their surname. The maternal line descended from Jewish Conversos of the Monzón area. In 1524, his father Antonio Serveto (alias Revés, i.e. "Reverse"), who was a notary at the royal monastery of Sijena nearby, sent young Michael to college, probably at the University of Zaragoza or Lérida. Servetus had two brothers: one who became a notary like their father, and another who was a Catholic priest. Servetus was very gifted in languages and studied Latin, Greek and Hebrew. At the age of fifteen, Servetus entered the service of a Franciscan friar by the name of Juan de Quintana, an Erasmian, and read the entire Bible in its original languages from the manuscripts that were available at that time. He later attended the University of Toulouse in 1526 where he studied law. There he became suspect of participating in secret meetings and activities of Protestant students.

In 1529, Servetus traveled through Germany and Italy with Quintana, who was then Charles V's confessor in the imperial retinue. In October 1530 he visited Johannes Oecolampadius in Basel, staying there for about ten months, and probably supporting himself as a proofreader for a local printer. By this time, he was already spreading his beliefs. In May 1531 he met Martin Bucer and Fabricius Capito in Strasbourg. Then two months later, in July, he published De trinitatis erroribus ("On the Errors of the Trinity"). The next year he published Dialogorum de Trinitate ("Dialogues on the Trinity") and De Iustitia Regni Christi ("On the Justice of Christ's Reign"). 

In these books, Servetus built a theology which maintains that the belief of the Trinity is not based on biblical teachings but rather on what he saw as deceiving teachings of (Greek) philosophers. He saw himself as leading a return to the simplicity and authenticity of the Gospels and the early Church Fathers. In part he hoped that the dismissal of the Trinitarian dogma would also make Christianity more appealing to Judaism and Islam, which had remained as strictly monotheistic religions. 

Servetus affirmed that the divine Logos, which was a manifestation of God and not a separate divine Person, was united to a human being, Jesus, when God's spirit came into the womb of the Virgin Mary. Only from the moment of conception, the Son was actually generated. Therefore the Son was not eternal, but only the Logos from which He was formed. For this reason, Servetus always rejected that Christ was the "eternal Son of God", but rather that he was simply "the Son of the eternal God". This theology, although totally original, has often been compared to Adoptionism and to Sabellianism or Modalism, which were old Christian heresies. Under severe pressure from Catholics and Protestants alike, Servetus somehow modified this explanation in his second book, Dialogues, to make the Logos coterminous with Christ. This made it nearly identical with the pre-Nicene view, but he was still accused of heresy because of his insistence on denying the dogma of the Trinity and the individuality of three divine Persons in one God.

He took on the pseudonym Michel de Villeneuve (i.e., "Michael from Villanueva"), in order to avoid persecution by the Church because of these religious works. He studied at the College Calvi in Paris in 1533. After an interval, he returned to Paris to study medicine in 1536. In Paris, his teachers included Sylvius, Fernel, and Guinter, who hailed him with Vesalius as his most able assistant in dissections.

Career.
After his studies in medicine he started a medical practice. He became personal physician to Archbishop Palmier of Vienne, and was also physician to Guy de Maugiron, the lieutenant governor of Dauphiné. While he practiced medicine near Lyon for about fifteen years, he also published two other works dealing with Ptolemy's Geography. Servetus dedicated his first edition of Ptolemy and his edition of the Bible to his patron Hugues de la Porte, and dedicated his second edition of Ptolemy's Geography to his other patron, Archbishop Palmier. While in Lyon, Symphorien Champier, a medical humanist, had been Servetus' patron, and the pharmacological tracts which Servetus wrote there were written in defense of Champier against Leonard Fuchs. 

While also working as a proof reader, he published a couple more books which dealt with medicine and pharmacology. Years earlier he had sent a copy to John Calvin, initiating a correspondence between the two. In  initial correspondence Servetus used the pseudonym "Michel de Villeneuve".

In 1553 Servetus published yet another religious work with further Antitrinitarian views. It was entitled Christianismi Restitutio, a work that sharply rejected the idea of predestination and the idea that God had condemned souls to Hell regardless of worth or merit. God, insisted Servetus, condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word or deed. To Calvin, who had written the fiery Christianae religionis institutio, Servetus' latest book was a slap in the face. The irate Calvin sent a copy of his own book as his reply. Servetus promptly returned it, thoroughly annotated with insulting observations. 

Calvin wrote to Servetus, "I neither hate you nor despise you; nor do I wish to persecute you; but I would be as hard as iron when I behold you insulting sound doctrine with so great audacity." 

In time their correspondences grew more heated until Calvin ended it. Whereupon Servetus bombarded Calvin with a slew of extraordinarily unfriendly letters.  Chapter XXI, page 481 Thus Calvin's antagonism against Servetus seems to have been based not simply on his unorthodox views but also on Servetus's tone of superiority mixed with personal abuse. Calvin stated of Servetus, when writing to his friend William Farel on 13 February 1546:

"Servetus has just sent me a long volume of his ravings. If I consent he will come here, but I will not give my word for if he comes here, if my authority is worth anything, I will never permit him to depart alive
("Si venerit, modo valeat mea autoritas, vivum exire nunquam patiar").


Imprisonment and execution.
On 16 February 1553, Servetus, while in Vienne, was denounced as a heretic by Guillaume Trie, a rich merchant who took refuge in Geneva and a very good friend of Calvin, in a letter sent to a cousin, Antoine Arneys, living in Lyon. On behalf of the French inquisitor Matthieu Ory, Servetus as well as Arnollet, the printer of Christianismi Restitutio, were questioned, but they denied all charges and were released for lack of evidence. Arneys was asked by Ory to write back to Trie, demanding proof.

On March 26, 1553, the book and the letters sent by Servetus to Calvin were forwarded to Lyon by Trie.

On April 4, 1553 Servetus was arrested by the Roman Catholic authorities, and imprisoned in Vienne. He escaped from prison three days later. On June 17, he was convicted of heresy by the French inquisition, "thanks to the 17 letters sent by Jehan Calvin, preacher in Geneva" and sentenced to be burned with his books. An effigy and his books were burned in his absence.

Meaning to flee to Italy, Servetus stopped in at Geneva, where Calvin and his Reformers had denounced him. On August 13, he attended a sermon by Calvin at Geneva. He was immediately recognized and arrested after the service and was again imprisoned and had all his property confiscated. 

Unfortunately for Servetus, at this time Calvin was fighting to maintain his weakening power in Geneva. Calvin's delicate health and usefulness to the state meant he did not personally appear against Servetus. Also Calvin's opponents used Servetus as a pretext for attacking the Geneva Reformer's theocratic government.  It became a matter of prestige for Calvin to be the instigator of Servetus's prosecution. "He was forced to push the condemnation of Servetus with all the means at his command."  However Nicholas de la Fontaine played the more active role in Servetus's prosecution and the listing of points that condemned him. 

At his trial, Servetus was condemned on two counts, for spreading and preaching Nontrinitarianism and anti-paedobaptism (anti-infant baptism). Of paedobaptism Michael Servetus had said, "It is an invention of the devil, an infernal falsity for the destruction of all Christianity" Whatever the cause of them, be it irritation or mistreatment, his statements that common Christian traditions were "of the devil" severely harmed his ability to make allies. Nevertheless, Sebastian Castellio denounced his execution and became a harsh critic of Calvin due to the whole affair. 

In the case the Procureur General, who was not Nicholas, added some curious sounding accusations, in the form of inquiries, the most odd sounding perhaps being, "whether he has married, and if he answers that he has not, he shall be asked why, in consideration of his age, he could refrain so long from marriage." To this oblique imputation of unchastity Servetus replied that rupture had long since made him incapable of that particular sin. More offensive to modern ears might be the question "whether he did not know that his doctrine was pernicious, considering that he favors Jews and Turks, by making excuses for them, and if he has not studied the Koran in order to disprove and controvert the doctrine and religion that the Christian churches hold, together with other profane books, from which people ought to abstain in matters of religion, according to the doctrine of St. Paul."

Although Calvin believed Servetus deserving of death on account of his "execrable blasphemies", he nevertheless hoped that it would not be by fire, as he was inclined toward clemency. Calvin expressed these sentiments in a letter to Farel, written about a week after Servetus  arrest, in which he also mentions an exchange between himself and Servetus. Calvin writes:  

 after he  had been recognized, I thought he should be detained. My friend Nicolas summoned him on a capital charge, offering himself as a security according to the lex talionis. On the following day he adduced against him forty written charges. He at first sought to evade them. Accordingly we were summoned. He impudently reviled me, just as if he regarded me as obnoxious to him. I answered him as he deserved  of the man s effrontery I will say nothing; but such was his madness that he did not hesitate to say that devils possessed divinity; yea, that many gods were in individual devils, inasmuch as a deity had been substantially communicated to those equally with wood and stone. I hope that sentence of death will at least be passed on him; but I desired that the severity of the punishment be mitigated.

As Servetus was not a citizen of Geneva, and legally could at worst be banished, they had consulted with other Swiss cantons (Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen), which universally favored his condemnation and execution. In the Protestant world Basel banned the sale of his book. Martin Luther condemned his writing in strong terms. Servetus and Philip Melanchthon had strongly hostile views of each other.  Most Protestant Reformers saw Servetus as a dangerous radical, and the concept of religious freedom did not really exist yet. The Catholic world had also imprisoned him and condemned him to death, which apparently spurred Calvin to equal their rigor.  Those who went against the idea of his execution, the party called "Libertines", drew the ire of much of Christendom. On 24 October Servetus was sentenced to death by burning for denying the Trinity and infant baptism. When Calvin requested that Servetus be executed by decapitation rather than fire, Farel, in a letter of September 8, chided him for undue leniency, and the Geneva Council refused his request. On 27 October 1553 Servetus was burned at the stake just outside Geneva. Historians record his last words as: "Jesus, Son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me."

The common view of the age, that heretics like Servetus should be subject to punishment, was explained by Calvin as follows:Whoever shall maintain that wrong is done to heretics and blasphemers in punishing them makes himself an accomplice in their crime and guilty as they are. There is no question here of man's authority; it is God who speaks, and clear it is what law he will have kept in the church, even to the end of the world. Wherefore does he demand of us a so extreme severity, if not to show us that due honor is not paid him, so long as we set not his service above every human consideration, so that we spare not kin, nor blood of any, and forget all humanity when the matter is to combat for His glory.

Modern relevance.
Due to his rejection of the Trinity and eventual execution by burning for heresy, Servetus is often regarded as the first Unitarian martyr. Since the Unitarians and Universalists have joined in the United States, and changed their focus, his ideas are no longer very relevant to modern Unitarian Universalism. A few scholars insist he had more in common with Sabellianism or Arianism or that he even had a theology unique to himself. Nevertheless his influence on the beginnings of the Unitarian movement in Poland and Transylvania has been confirmed by scholars, and two Unitarian Universalist congregations are named after him, in Minnesota and Washington. A church window is also dedicated to Servetus at the First Unitarian Congregational Society of Brooklyn, NY.

Servetus was the first European to describe pulmonary circulation, although it was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. Further, most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. It was not until William Harvey's dissections in 1616 that the function of pulmonary circulation was widely accepted by physicians. In 1984, a Zaragoza public hospital changed its name from José Antonio to Miguel Servet. It is now a university hospital.

<doc id="5698039" title="Minor characters on Frasier" nonfiltered="422" processed="418" dbindex="1480425">
Besides the main characters Frasier Crane, his father Martin and brother Niles, Daphne Moon, Roz Doyle and a few others, there are several minor characters who regularly appear on the American television sitcom Frasier, or who have important but limited roles.



Crane men's love interests.
As many of the plots on Frasier surround the romantic entanglements of the Crane men, several women have significant minor roles on the series. The more significant of these are listed below:

Sherry Dempsey.

Sherry Dempsey (Marsha Mason) is a waitress at MacGynty's, Martin's favorite bar, and, for a short time, Martin's girlfriend.  Sherry is fun-loving, brash, loud and crass, and she and Martin share many interests. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Frasier and Niles dislike her, but nevertheless, for the sake of family unity, they attempt to tolerate her. Martin and Sherry eventually break up when they decide that they both want different things out of the relationship.

Melinda "Mel" Karnofsky.

Dr. Melinda "Mel" Karnofsky (Jane Adams) is Maris Crane's plastic surgeon, and for a period, Niles Crane's girlfriend and (briefly) wife. She is fussy, neurotic, and fastidious, much like Niles. Mel also has one son, who she (it is implied) bore at a young age (based off a picture that Niles saw on Mel's desk). When Niles confesses to Mel his love for Daphne, Mel, Niles' wife for only several days, becomes hurt and bitter. To make Niles pay for all the pain and frustration he's put her through, Mel does not guarantee an immediate divorce; instead, she forces Niles to play along that the two remain happily married, assuring him that after he has done this on several select social occasions she will file for divorce. It quickly becomes apparent, however, that she is merely stringing him along out of spite, and taking the opportunity to force him to humiliate himself publicly  in the process. At a social event held by Frasier, however, Mel finally pushes Niles to the limit; refusing to put either Daphne or himself through "this sham of a marriage" any longer, Niles publicly disowns the marriage, and the two are quickly divorced. Mel does not appear again in the series after this.

Ronee Lawrence.

Ronee Lawrence (Wendie Malick) is Niles and Frasier's old babysitter, and the first woman to break Frasier's heart (he used to watch her kiss her boyfriend through the bannisters).  She is also responsible for Niles' compulsive furniture-wiping, as she told him stories when he was a child about earwigs laying eggs on all the furniture, which would hatch, crawl into his ears, and eat his brain.  

In 2003 she meets Frasier by chance and eventually she and Martin fall in love and get married on May 15 (Eddie's birthday) the next year in the show's final episode, "Goodnight, Seattle".

She released an album called "Mood Swings", and works as a lounge singer and pianist at the Wellington Club. Ronee drives a red 1950's Cadillac.  Her traditionally-minded, prudish mother lives in Spokane, Washington.

Charlotte.
Charlotte (Laura Linney) is a matchmaker recently arrived from Chicago, and Frasier's final love interest on the series. Frasier initially hires her to set him up with someone following a particularly grim period regarding his romantic prospects, only to fall in love with her instead of the women she sets him up with. Although she initially has a boyfriend, she eventually returns his feelings, but the relationship is forced to end when Charlotte moves back to Chicago. The series ends with Frasier on a plane arriving in Chicago, intent on continuing the relationship.

Crane family members.

The following are significant members of the Crane family excluding Frasier, Martin and Niles Crane. Although most of the series revolves around Frasier Crane and his immediate family, occasionally members of Frasier's extended family appear. These are listed below.

Eddie.

Eddie is Martin's dog, a large Jack Russell Terrier.  Eddie was played by two dogs: first Moose, and then Moose's son Enzo, who first appeared as a stunt double.

Eddie is known for responding to Martin and Daphne with human-like understanding, but often seems to taunt Frasier.  An early recurring gag had Eddie staring unceasingly at Frasier, to Frasier's increasing annoyance. Frasier's ex-wife Lillith is the only one who scares Eddie and whenever she is around Eddie does "exactly" as Lillith says.

Eddie is often featured in the closing sequences of a show, when the closing theme is sung as the credits roll, in a short vignette relating to a joke from earlier in the episode.

Moose, the feisty Jack Russell terrier who played Eddie on TV's Frasier, died June 26, 2006, at the home of his trainer, Mathilde Halberg.  He was 15-and-a-half years old. 

Moose had retired from showbiz when he was 10, in the year 2000, and had been replaced by his lookalike son named Enzo for the final seasons of Frasier.

Frederick Gaylord Crane.
Frederick Gaylord Crane (Trevor Einhorn, Luke Tarsitano) is the son of Frasier and Lilith Sternin. "Freddy" appears in several episodes throughout the show's run. He lives with his mother in Boston but often comes to visit Frasier in Seattle on the holidays.

Initially his personality is very undeveloped, as he is just a small child. As he gets older more traits begin to develop. At around eight he develops a crush on Daphne, much to Niles' jealousy. As he gets older he begins to get somewhat spoiled and surly, and enjoys Frasier's company less and less, prompting Frasier to fear a growing generation gap.

Hester Rose Crane.
Hester Rose Crane (Nancy Marchand in Cheers, Rita Wilson in Frasier) was Martin's wife and Niles and Frasier's mother.  By the time the series begins, she has been dead for approximately six years; throughout the course of the series, the cause of her death is never expressly revealed although it is indicated in "Rooms with a View" she died from a terminal disease.  Hester appears in a dream sequence (experienced by Frasier) and in 8mm cine transferred to video (in the Seventh-season episode "Momma Mia" where Rita Wilson also plays Mia Preston who is the spitting image of Hester).All three Crane men miss her terribly.

Hester was a psychiatrist and the inspiration for both Frasier and Niles to go into the profession.  She named her two sons after favorite lab rats.  Both her sons take after her more than they do their father, being amusingly supercilious and intellectually pompous.  For example, Frasier and Niles quote her in the pilot-episode as saying "a handshake is as good as a hug."

Maris Crane.
See main article: Maris Crane

Maris Crane is Niles Crane's wife for the early seasons of the show. Immensely spoiled, dominating and neurotic, she does not appear on the show but is frequently referenced. She is arguably the most notable of the show's many unseen characters. She is also implied to be pathologically emaciated, often the subject of many jokes.

Nikos Crane.
Nikos Crane is the son of Walt and Zora Crane.  He is Martin's nephew, and Frasier and Niles' cousin.

Walt Crane.
Walt Crane is Martin's brother.  He appears only once, in an episode where he and Martin remeet, only to become separated again by the end of the episode.

Zora Crane.
Zora Crane, a Greek woman, is Walt Crane's wife, and Martin's sister-in-law, and the one responsible for Walt and Martin's separation.

Lilith Sternin.
See main article: Lilith Sternin

Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) is the ex-wife of Frasier Crane and mother of their son, Frederick. A cold, remote woman, she is disliked by most of his family and friends. Lilith appeared as a prominent character on Cheers, in which Frasier also first appeared.

Nanette Guzman/"Nanny G".
Nanny G is Frasier's first wife and a well-known children's entertainer.  She first appeared in a Cheers episode played by Emma Thompson.  In a final season episode of Frasier, Laurie Metcalf played Nanny G.  The character also appeared in a fantasy sequence as the young hippie from Frasier's memory played by Dina Spybey.  Frasier and Nanette were briefly married when he was an undergraduate.  The two experienced a strong sexual chemistry but no reason is given for the marriage ending.

KACL staff and professionals.

This section outlines the various people with whom Frasier works with at KACL 780AM (the radio station from which Frasier's show is broadcast) or has another otherwise professional relationship with.

Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe.

See main article: Bob 'Bulldog' Briscoe

Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe (Dan Butler) hosts the "Gonzo Sports Show" on KACL. He is a boorish, intensely macho sports fan, and the urbane Frasier is frequently annoyed by Bulldog, partly because of the other man's more 'common' characteristics, and partly because Frasier is usually the butt of Bulldog's jokes. Bulldog is an intense womaniser, and has casual affairs with many women (who he usually dumps just as casually), but has something of a crush on Roz.

Chopper Dave.

Chopper Dave (Richard Poe) hosts KACL's Eye in the Sky traffic reports. He has a tendency to speak very loudly due to spending time trying to speak over the rotors of his helicopter. He has also been known to annoy his colleagues by flying his helicopter very close to their apartment windows.

Gil Chesterton.

Gilbert "Gil" Leslie Chesterton (Edward Hibbert) is a food critic and host of the show "Restaurant Beat" on KACL.   

A pompous, catty, effeminate, overrefined character, believed by his coworkers to be in the closet, Gil is married to Deb, a "Sarah Lawrence graduate and the owner of a very successful auto body repair shop", whom his co-workers had believed to be merely a pet cat. Gil claims to have had no idea anybody ever thought he was gay, even mentioning (or at least claiming) that he is married (to a woman) in a Season 5 episode (The Perfect Guy), and much of the humor related to the character stems from his adamant denial of his supposed sexual orientation, along with his general snarkiness. In one memorable episode, Frasier is disturbed to find that he is having heavily symbolic and vaguely sexual dreams about Gil. Frasier comes up with various interpreations, hoping to prove that the dreams don't actually mean he is attracted to Gil on some level, but in the end none of the interpretations are satisfactory.

In the final season of the show, Gil's homosexuality begins to become more apparent. After a misunderstanding results in Frasier being publicly (and falsely) outed on the air after being spotted at a local gay bar, Gil attempts to coach Frasier on coming out, congratulating him on his first steps onto "the Yellow Brick Road to pride and self-acceptance." During the episode's credits, Gil himself is seen covertly entering the gay bar in question, Bad Billy's.  

Gil drives a red BMW with a red interior and is almost always seen wearing his trademark bow tie.  He is also a veteran of the armed services (he once refers to having "seen some cruel pranks in the Army"), and his taste buds are insured.

The character is named in honor of the real-life (and quite heterosexual) Gil Chesterton, a former journalism teacher (now retired) at Beverly Hills High School.  One of the series' producers, Christopher Lloyd, was Chesterton's student years ago, and Lloyd evidently felt naming a character in a hit sitcom would be a nice homage to his former teacher.

Bebe Glazer.
See main article: Bebe Glazer

Bebe Glazer (Harriet Sansom Harris) is Frasier's agent over the course of most of the series. An intensely manipulative and seductive woman, with no apparent morals whatsoever, she is often compared to the Prince of Darkness by most of the characters. Frasier relies on her intensely in order to get the best deal he can out of his employers, whilst simultaneously frequently being horrified by her extremely flexible and questionable ethics.

Julia Wilcox.

Julia Wilcox (Felicity Huffman) becomes the new financial reporter for the KACL late in the series' run.  She is the author of two books, Practical Applications of Econometrics and Day Trade Your Way Out of Debt, the latter of which had stirred some controversy and had eventually contributed to her being fired from CNN.  

Her no-nonsense, all-business demeanor and arrogant and stand-offish attitude earn her the dislike of the other staff.  Julia files a complaint against Frasier and KACL for sexual harassment (Frasier had misunderstood her behaviour towards him), but later dropped the charges.

When Frasier discovers that his accountant and former Oxford classmate, Avery, is cheating on his wife with Julia, he confronts Avery, unaware that Julia is hiding in a closet, overhearing the entire conversation.  Julia's attitude towards Frasier begins to soften after this display of chivalry on his part, and she uses her connections to have Ben, a British street musician (Elvis Costello) whom Frasier and Niles find annoying, then playing a regular gig at Café Nervosa, offered a full-time job elsewhere.  

She and Frasier have a brief romantic encounter, although her boorish and coarse behavior towards Martin, Niles, and Daphne ultimately persuades Frasier to break off their relationship.

Kenny Daley.

Kenny Daley (Tom McGowan) is a long-time radio man; little else is known about him.  Apparently a successful DJ, in 1993 he was reduced to delivering pizzas as he was out of work at the time.   Kenny was married with at least 3 children, but got divorced in 2003, following which he suffered a breakdown. 

Kenny becomes the new station manager of KACL in 1998.  A likeable and relaxed manager, he soon becomes friends with all the staff there. 

Kenny resigns as station manager after deciding to go back to DJing, and Roz is appointed as his replacement.

Kate Costas.
Kate Costas (Mercedes Ruehl) is one of several KACL station managers prior to Kenny.  Frasier and Kate have a love-hate relationship finding themselves on opposite sides on programming decisions and union negotiations.  They have a brief affair before Kate leaves to accept a management position at a Chicago  station.

Noel Shempsky.

Noel Shempsky (Patrick Kerr) is a painfully geeky Trekkie who keeps an autographed picture of William Shatner as Captain Kirk on his desk and is fluent in Klingon. His station nickname is "Noel the Mole". 

He works in an unknown capacity behind the scenes at KACL. From early in the series he is in love with Roz Doyle, who does not feel the same way about him. In the episode entiltied 'Star Mitzvah' it is revealed that Shempsky is Jewish.

His claim to fame, as seen when he volunteers to be the station representative during contract negotiations, is that he can faint at will.

Moon family members.
This section discusses the more significant members of Daphne Moon's family, a large, working-class clan from Manchester, England.  Many of the actors who play Moon family members do not have specifically Mancunian English accents; Anthony LaPaglia, Richard E. Grant and Robbie Coltrane, who portray Daphne's brothers, and Brian Cox who portrays her father, were not even born in England (La Paglia is Australian, Grant was born in Swaziland and both Coltrane and Cox are Scottish) and this apparent discrepancy is never addressed on the show but may be taken as an in-joke (see below). 

Gertrude Moon.
Gertrude Moon (Millicent Martin) is Daphne's mother.  The two have a difficult and complex relationship, and Daphne appears to dislike her mother intensely whilst still remaining intensely loyal and subservient to her.  Domineering and ever-complaining, Gertrude is doting and always forgiving towards her son Simon's selfish behaviour but is hyper-critical of her ever-supportive and long-suffering daughter, frequently guilting Daphne into providing what she wants. When Gertrude leaves her husband she goes to Seattle; there she unsuccessfully tries to start a romance with Martin and briefly lives with Niles and Daphne, where she quickly overstays her welcome.

Grammy Moon.
Grammy Moon, Daphne's paternal grandmother, is frequently mentioned but never seen or heard from on the show (see also: Maris Crane).  She and her numerous eccentricities, cooking tips and health complaints are frequently the subject of Daphne's long-winded stories.

Harry Moon.
Harry Moon (Brian Cox) is Daphne's father.  Although he is an alcoholic and a layabout (who supports his drinking on the money given to him by men who attempt to impress their girlfriends by pretending to hit Harry after he pretends to chat up their girlfriends), his relationship with Daphne is closer than the relationship between Daphne and her mother. Seemingly trapped in a long-suffering marriage with his wife, he eventually left her; with Niles' intervention, they attempted a reconciliation, but it was short-lived, and Harry Moon eventually returned to England.

Michael Moon.
Michael Moon (Robbie Coltrane) is a brother of Daphne's. Michael appeared in the two-part series finale, Goodnight, Seattle, and his speech is almost entirely incomprehensible (and utilises Coltrane's Scots accent despite the Moons being from Manchester) except for random odd words such as 'boom'.

Simon Moon.
Simon Moon (Anthony LaPaglia) is one of Daphne's brothers. An obnoxious and boorish heavy drinker and layabout, Simon has a difficult relationship with his sister, largely because of Simon's uncouth and selfish nature. He is greatly disliked by both Frasier and Niles, partly because of their class-conscious nature but also because when in Seattle he frequently stays with one of them, often taking unreasonable liberties with regard to their homes, possessions and alcohol supplies in the process. Conversely, he gets on quite well with Martin and, despite his many negative qualities, is quite a popular man who is very successful at attracting women. Roz is quite taken with him (and him with her) at first, but she eventually catches on to his ways and rejects his advances. Simon appears in eight episodes.

Stephen Moon.
Stephen Moon (Richard E. Grant) is Daphne's favorite brother. He appears in person in in the series finale Goodnight, Seattle (and speaks with Grant's trademark RP 'posh' accent despite the Moons being from Manchester). Many of Daphne's stories about Stephen imply that he is if  not gay then he is confused about his feminine side. The character also appears in the two-part episode And The Dish Ran Away With The Spoon, where he is played by a different actor and has no speaking lines.

Niles and Maris' household staff.
This section discusses the significant members of Maris and Niles' household staff who are mentioned on the show. Of these, Marta is significant as the only member of the household staff to have both a recurring role in the series complete with dialogue.

Marta.
Marta is Niles and Maris' elderly maid.  She comes from a remote mountain village in Guatemala, and has difficulty with her English pronouns. She speaks fluent German, however, owing to her previous experience working for a German family 'who turned up in Guatemala just after the war'. She is the only member of Maris' household staff to be regularly seen on the show.

Yoshi.
Yoshi is Niles and Maris' elderly and temperamental Japanese gardener. He is frequently mentioned by Niles, usually when referring to arguments over the zen garden Yoshi is keen to build. He is never seen or heard on the series, and dies of a heart attack while trimming Maris' elaborate hedge maze -- Niles said 'the paramedics never had a chance.'

Minor Staff Members.

Mary
Mary is Niles and Maris' housekeeper, and a fan of The Dr. Frasier Crane Show.

Nadia
Nadia, Maris' "hatchet maid," is never seen or heard.

Other characters.
Alice May Doyle.

Alice May Doyle (Ashley Thomas) is the daughter of Roz Doyle.  She first appears as a newborn, and by the end of the series has become a child of six.

Donny Douglas.

Donald Ronald Douglas (Saul Rubinek) is Niles' divorce lawyer and, for a period, Daphne's boyfriend and fiancé. Ironically, despite his intense crush on Daphne, it is actually Niles who first introduces the two; they meet during Niles' divorce proceedings, when Donny is helping Daphne to prepare her upcoming testimony. 

Ultimately, Daphne leaves Donny at the altar in favour of Niles. Embittered, Donny initially sues both her and Frasier (who was responsible for Daphne and Niles getting together), but eventually drops the lawsuit. Niles and Daphne later run into Donny when getting married at city court, where he is getting married again. He announces that Daphne was the love of his life, in front of his bride-to-be.

Jerome Belasco.

Jerome Belasco is a crime boss, whom Niles and Frasier approach in order to seek his help in getting one of Maris' parking tickets overturned - an action which soon comes back to haunt Frasier, as he must then provide couples counselling for Belasco's girlfriend. He was portrayed by Harris Yulin, who was nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of Jerome.

Bob Gardner.

Bob Gardner is the husband of Lana Gardner and father of Kirby. Having previously abandoned his wife for another woman, he later had second thoughts and debated whether to return to her - coincidentally, at an airport he met up with Frasier, who was considering whether or not pursue Lana romantically at the time, and after a brief conversation decided to remain with his wife. Frasier, who had also left the conversation with the intent to pursue Lana, decided as a consequence to withdraw and advised Lana to at least attempt to restore her marriage.

Kirby Gardner.

Kirby (Brian Klugman) is the teenaged son of Lana and Bob Gardner, and sometime employee of KACL.  He is briefly tutored by Frasier, and does odd jobs for Niles.

Lana Gardner.

Lana Gardner (Jean Smart) is an old high school classmate of Frasier's, on whom both Frasier and Niles had crushes during high school.  Frasier and Lana meet again as adults, and have a brief romantic relationship while Lana is estranged from her husband, Bob. Frasier calls this off owing to Lana's immensely aggressive personality. They later become friends. Lana is the mother of Kirby. In Jean Smart's first appearance as this character, she was known as Lorna Lynley.

Rick Garrett.

Rick Garrett is a waiter at Cafe Nervosa.  At twenty, he has an affair with Roz, which results in her getting pregnant.  Their child is Alice May Doyle.

Derek Mann.

Derek Mann (voiced by Joe Mantegna) is a newspaper columnist who is one of Frasier's biggest critics. His columns often debase Frasier's program and often twists the doctor's innocent advice to make Frasier look bad in the eyes of the public. He once challenged Frasier to a fistfight after the doctor publically ridiculed him on his radio show.

Cam Winston.

Cam Winston (Brian Stokes Mitchell) is the tenant of the apartment above Frasier's and Frasier's rival. The two frequently clash and compete over parking spaces, apartment board placement, and balcony rights. For all their rivalry, the two have similar tastes, mannerisms and personalities, which may contribute to their clashes. The two have a history of trumping each other back and forth via the apartment board: while Frasier convinces the board to ban Cam from parking his SUV in the provided garage, Cam hangs an American flag over his balcony, covering Frasier's view; as well as the obvious inconvenience, this incident also damages Frasier's standing with the board, as when he protests it Cam twists matters as to make Frasier seem unpatriotic. When their parents feign that they are dating to have the two come to a truce, Cam and Frasier finally end their feud and compromise with each other to please their parents.

Dr. Frasier Crane Show callers.
Voices for callers who phone in to the Dr. Frasier Crane Show were provided, in many cases, by famous actors and other personalities.  They literally called in to record their parts, without having to go in to the studio.

<doc id="13057" title="Gatling gun" nonfiltered="423" processed="419" dbindex="1480426">

The Gatling gun is a rapid-repeating weapon invented in the 1860s which used multiple rotating barrels turned by a hand crank. Unlike  earlier weapons, such as the mitrailleuse, which had limited capacity and long reloading times, the Gatling gun was reliable, easy to load, and had a high firing rate. The gun was designed by the American inventor Richard J. Gatling, in 1861 and patented in 1862. 

The Gatling gun may have been the first "machine gun", depending on how 'machine gun' is defined, as it was capable of firing  continuous bursts of fire. Unlike designs like the Maxim gun, which operate the mechanism using a fraction of the power of the fired cartridge, the Gatling gun relies on external power, such as a hand crank, or motor.  Some later Gatling-type weapons diverted gas from the barrels to spin the rotating barrels.

The term Gatling gun is still used, to refer to rotating-barrel cannons such as  M61 20mm cannon and its younger brother the GAU-12 used in the AC-130 gunship.

History of the Gatling.


Although the Gatling gun was designed in 1861 during the U.S. Civil War, in 1862, the U.S. government decided not to purchase any of the weapons, because the firing mechanism lacked triggers and because the Gatling guns were far too heavy to be set up quickly in combat. Even with design improvements, the Gatling gun still lacked a trigger and weighed an unwieldy 90 lb (41 kg). However, Union General Benjamin Butler bought twelve and used them on the Petersburg front. During its debut in combat soldiers on both sides were awestruck by its power and destructive effect. They were only put into limited service late in the war by the Union Army.

The British Royal Navy installed fixed Gatling guns on its warships, and US forces used them in the Indian Wars. During the Japanese Boshin War (1868-1869), Gatling guns were used in land battles and mounted on ships to repel boarders. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, Gatling guns were used by the French armies fighting in the provinces, to replace the defective mitrailleuse. 

The Naval Brigades serving during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 used Gatling guns in several battles. Gatling guns were used during the British bombardment of Alexandria in 1882.Gatling guns were used by the US side during the Spanish-American War, most notably during the battle of San Juan Hill. 

Basic design.


The Gatling gun was hand-crank operated with six barrels revolving around a central shaft, similar to the Puckle Gun. Early models had a fibrous matting stuffed in among the barrels which could be soaked with water to cool the barrels down. Later models eliminated the matting-filled barrels as being counterproductive. The ammunition was initially a steel cylinder charged with black powder and primed with a percussion cap, because self-contained brass cartridges had not yet been invented. The shells were gravity-fed into the breech through a hopper or stick magazine on top of the gun. Each barrel had its own firing mechanism. After 1861, new brass cartridges similar to modern cartridges replaced the paper cartridge, but Gatling did not switch to them immediately.

The model of 1881 was designed to use the 'Bruce'-style feed system (U.S. Patents 247,158 and 343,532) that accepted two rows of .45/70 cartridges. While one row was being fed into the gun, the other could be reloaded, thus allowing sustained fire. The final gun required four operators. By 1876 the Gatling gun had a theoretical rate of fire of 1,200 rounds per minute, although 400 rounds per minute was more readily achievable in combat.

Each barrel fires once per revolution at about the same position. Originally, the Gatling gun was produced in calibres ranging from one inch (25.4 mm) down to 0.45 inch (11.43 mm). The barrels, a carrier, and a lock cylinder were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft, mounted on an oblong fixed frame. The carrier was grooved and the lock cylinder was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels. Each barrel had a single lock, working in the lock cylinder on a line with the barrel. The lock cylinder was encased and joined to the frame. The casing was partitioned, and through this opening the barrel shaft was journaled. In front of the casing was a cam with spiral surfaces. The cam imparted a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated. Also in the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun. 

Turning the crank rotated the shaft. Cartridges, held in a hopper, dropped individually into the grooves of the carrier. The lock was simultaneously forced by the cam to move forward and load the cartridge and when the cam was at its highest point the cocking ring freed the lock and fired the cartridge. After the cartridge was fired the continuing action of the cam drew back the lock bringing with it the spent cartridge which then dropped to the ground.

The grouped barrel concept had been explored by inventors since the 18th century, but poor engineering and the lack of a unitary cartridge made previous designs unsuccessful. The initial Gatling gun design used self-contained, reloadable steel cylinders with a chamber holding a ball and black-powder charge, and a percussion cap nipple on one end. As the barrels rotated, these steel cylinders dropped into place, were fired, and were then ejected from the gun. The innovative features of the Gatling gun were its independent firing mechanism for each barrel and the simultaneous action of the locks, barrels, carrier and breech.

The smallest calibre gun also had a Broadwell drum feed in place of the curved magazine of the other guns. The drum, named after L. W. Broadwell, an agent for Gatling's company, comprised twenty stick magazines arranged around a central axis, like the spokes of a wheel, each holding twenty cartridges with the bullet noses oriented toward the central axis. This significant invention does not appear to have been patented separately, and may have been included in the April 9, 1872 patent, U.S. 125,563; a post and base, apparently for mounting a Broadwell drum, is visible in Figure 13 of U.S. 125,563. As each magazine emptied, the drum was manually rotated to bring a new magazine into use until all 400 rounds had been fired.

The Gatling gun was largely replaced after the development of the gas or recoil blowback concept, which is the basis of most modern machine guns. Such guns could be made smaller and lighter, and were less expensive to produce.



Modern Gatling-style guns.
After Gatling guns were replaced by lighter, cheaper blowback-style weapons, the approach of using multiple rotating barrels fell into disuse for many decades. However, Gatling gun-style weapons made a return in the 1970s, when weapons with very high rate of fire were needed in military aircraft such as the AC-130 gunship and ship-based CIWS. For these modern rotating-barrel cannons, electric motors were used to rotate the barrel.

One of the main reasons for the resurgence of the Gatling gun-style design is the rotating barrel weapon's tolerance for continuous high-volume rates of fire. For example, if 2000 rounds were fired non-stop at high rate from a conventional single-barrel weapon, this would likely result in overheating of the barrel or a jam in the weapon. In contrast, a five-barreled Gatling gun-style weapon firing 2000 rounds would fire 400 rounds per barrel, which would be acceptable. 

One example is the M61 Vulcan 20 mm cannon, the most commonly-used member of a family of weapons designed by General Electric and currently manufactured by General Dynamics. It is a six-barrelled Gatling capable of more than 6,000 rounds per minute, a rate unachievable with a conventional machine gun. Similar systems are available ranging from 5.56 mm to 30 mm (there was even a 37 mm Gatling on the prototype T249 'Vigilante' AA platform), the rate-of-fire being somewhat inversely-proportional to the size and mass of the ammunition (which also determines the size and mass of the barrels). 

During the Vietnam War, the 7.62 mm calibre M134 Minigun was created as a helicopter weapon. Able to fire 6,000 rounds a minute from a 4,000-round linked belt, the Minigun proved to be one of the most effective non-explosive projectile weapons ever built and is still used in helicopters today. They are also used with lethal effectiveness on USAF AC-130 and AC-119 Gunships, their original high-capacity airframes able to house the items needed for sustained operation. With sophisticated navigation and target identification tools, Miniguns can be used effectively even against concealed targets. The crew's ability to concentrate the Gatling's fire very tightly produces the appearance of the 'Red Tornado'  from the light of the tracers, as the gun platform circles a target at night.

In addition to the benefits mentioned above, many modern systems have the advantage of being externally-driven (as opposed to relying on the energy from fired cartridges). This increases their reliability, as cartridge firing failure will not interrupt the operation cycle. Additionally, certain other stoppages, such as faulty extraction and many feeding-related problems, are eliminated or reduced considerably due to the external power source. It should however be noted that, although complex mechanically and uncommon, modern systems that derive power from the ammunition do exist. The world's fastest Gatling-style weapon, the 10,000 RPM GSh-6-23 uses a gas-operated drive system.

Popular culture.
Several popular action films have depicted modern Gatling guns (usually the M134 Minigun and variants thereof) as hand-held weapons. In the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Predator, Jesse Ventura's character had to be propped up during sequences where his M134 was fired, even though it had only reduced-power blanks. In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Schwarzenegger's heavy-duty android character used a Minigun without a support. 

These depictions are technically impossible as the combined weight of the weapon, power supply and requisite ammunition is much too great for human-portable use. A large ammunition supply is required for these weapons; depending on the rate of fire, several hundred to a thousand or more rounds could be necessary. Furthermore, the recoil is very forceful, and easily more than any person can handle. In addition, the power consumption of most modern systems require heavy power supplies; for instance, the M134's 28V DC/115V AC electric motor can consume up to 130A at maximum, the equivalent of multiple car batteries or a large portable generator.

Gatling guns are often depicted in military-themed films, television programs and video games. The accuracy of the depictions vary greatly, ranging from impracticable hip-firing of Miniguns to conventional vehicle mounts. In most depictions, the power supply needed to run the external drive, the external drive mechanism, and the large ammunition supply are often not depicted in these fictional recreations. Video game depictions of the Gatling gun also take creative liberties, often depicting the weapon as taking an abnormally long time to spin up, operating at a modest rate of fire, having a tiny ammunition supply, and suffering from overheating problems.

For the use of the bow in musical instruments, see bow (music).



    ]]

Bowing is the act of lowering the head, or sometimes the entire upper body from the waist, as a social gesture. This is common around the world, but is especially prominent in Oriental cultures especially in China, Korea, and Japan. Different cultures have placed varying degrees of importance on bowing, and have used bowing in a variety of ways. to show the highest degree of politeness, you bend your head and waste about 45 degrees. Common courtesy to most people is shown by bending your head and waist about 15 degrees. In a very casual meeting with a person about your age, nodding your head would be enough. People often bow while shaking hands with one or both hands.

In European cultures, bowing is an exclusively male practice - females perform a related gesture called a "curtsey" or "curtsy." As in Asian cultures, the depth of the bow expresses degree of respect or gratitude. In European courtly circles, males were expected to "bow and scrape" (hence the term "bowing and scraping" for what appears to be excessive ceremony). "Scraping" refers to the drawing back of the right leg as one bows, such that the right foot scrapes the floor or earth. Typically, while executing such a bow, the man's left hand is pressed horizontally across the abdomen while the right is held out from the body.

Bowing originated as a gesture of subordination, as lowering the head leaves the bower vulnerable. This was particularly the case in Asian cultures such as the Samurai's Tokugawa Shogun period in Japan. This was the period of which Samurais were at the height of a highly stratified society; as they increasingly became courtiers, bureaucrats, and administrators rather than warriors. 

Bowing in East Asia.
Bows are the traditional greeting in East Asia, more so in Korea and Japan than anywhere else. However, bowing is not reserved only for greetings. Bowing is a gesture of respect. Different bows are used for apologies and gratitude, to express different emotions, humility, sincerity, remorse, or deference, and in various traditional arts and religious ceremonies.

Basic bows are performed with the back straight and the hands at the sides (boys and men) or clasped in the lap (girls and women), and with the eyes down or closed.. Bows originate at the waist. Generally, the longer and deeper the bow, the stronger the emotion.

Bows can be generally divided into three main types: informal, formal, and very formal. Informal bows are made at about a fifteen degree angle and more formal bows at about thirty degrees. Very formal bows are deeper. There is an extremely complex etiquette surrounding bowing, including the length and depth of bow, and the appropriate response. For example, if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected (generally about two or three seconds), it is polite to bow again, upon which one may receive another bow in return. This often leads to a long exchange of progressively lighter bows.

Generally speaking, an inferior bows longer and more deeply, and more frequently, than a superior.

Bowing at school.
Students at all levels of primary and secondary education must bow many times each day.  A typical class begins and ends with the students and teacher standing and bowing in unison to each other.  Assemblies and club activities begin and end the same way; at assemblies students generally must also bow to each teacher who speaks in front of the assembled school.  School ceremonies (such as graduation, welcome and farewell ceremonies) and special gatherings follow the same pattern as well.

Students will generally bow after speaking with a teacher in the staffroom, in thanks or apology, and particularly after being scolded. 

In all but the most traditional schools, bows among teachers of similar rank are somewhat less frequent (except in thanks or apology), but subordinate teachers will usually bow when speaking with superior teachers such as the vice principal and principal.

Bows of apology and thanks.
Bows are a required and expected part of any apology or expression of thanks in Japan and Korea, and only parts of China.  

Bows of apology tend to be deeper and last longer than other types of bow.  They tend to occur with frequency during the apology, generally at about 45 degrees with the head lowered and lasting for at least the count of three, sometimes longer. The depth, frequency and duration of the bow increases with the sincerity of the apology and the severity of the offense.  Bows of thanks follow the same pattern. In extreme cases a kneeling bow is performed; this bow is sometimes so deep that the forehead touches the floor. This is called saikeirei (   ) in Kanji and sebae (  ) in Korean. 

Bows of apology are frequently performed at press conferences by high-ranking members of a company that has performed some misdeed, such as producing faulty parts that resulted in a death.  These bows are almost invariably performed standing behind a table; the tips of the fingers touch the table while the upper body, held straight, is lowered from the waist until the face is parallel with the tabletop.

Bows of greeting.
Bows are commonly used in greeting, both when meeting and when parting.  Bows almost automatically accompany the greeting phrases, but generally are no longer used among the immediate family unless addressing a family member after or in anticipation of a long absence or separation.

Bows also replace speaking under certain circumstances.  For example, when encountering again a person to whom one has already spoken that day, a silent bow replaces such phrases as "hello" or "hi."

A superior addressing an inferior will generally only nod the head slightly (some people may not bow at all), while an inferior will bend forward slightly from the waist.

Bowing and shaking hands.
When dealing with non-East Asians, many East Asians will shake hands.  Since many non-East Asians are familiar with the custom of bowing, this often leads to a combined bow and handshake which can be quite complicated to execute.  Bows may be combined with handshakes or performed before or after shaking hands.

Generally when bowing in proximity to another, as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands, people turn slightly to one side (usually the left) to avoid bumping heads.

Bowing in China.
Bowing in China is not nearly so formalized as in Japan and Korea. Bowing is normally reserved for occasions  such as funerals or ancestral worships only. The kowtow is extremely rare among the Chinese since the collapse of Imperial China. However in modern day China, bowing is necessary for Hangook people (Koreans) living in the Northern part of China. Vice versa for any Chinese or Japanese living in South Korea, a perfect example would be the community living in       Seoul City.

Bowing in Korea.
Bowing in Korean culture has different aspects to it than in other East Asian cultures. It is an especially integral part during martials arts, religious services dedicated to the dead, and formalized holidays. Unlike in the Japanese tea ceremony, a central approach to tea in Korea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation. As a result, other than a bow of greeting and departure, bowing is not an integral aspect of the Korean tea ceremony.

Bowing in Japan.

Bowing in Japan is distinct from other East Asian cultures when done in more traditional settings such as during a tea ceremony or during the beginning and end of a traditional martial arts match. 

Bowing in martial arts: Aikido, Kendo, Karate, Judo.
Bowing is an integral part of traditional martial arts.  Bows are used to begin and end practice, sparring bouts and competitions, and when entering and leaving the dojo, or practice room.  This tends to be standard among practitioners in any country, and is common also among the practitioners of martial arts originating from outside of Japan, such as Taekwondo and Kung Fu, but in Japan other types of bow (for example, of thanks or apology) are also standard in the dojo. In traditional Japan, a bow in a Kendo sword fight when one is defeated means a plea for beheading to save shame.

Bowing in tea ceremony.
Bowing is an important part of the Japanese tea ceremony.  

There are three main types of bow performed in a ceremony; they are classified as shin ( ), gy ( ), and s  ( ).  All are usually performed from a kneeling position.  Shin bows are the deepest; from a kneeling position, the bower bends forward from the waist, placing the hands palms down on the floor in front of the body, with the fingers facing.  Shin bows are performed to teachers and superiors.  Gy  and s  bows are less deep and less long (gy  bows are deeper).  From a kneeling position and bowing from the waist, the hands are slid over the knees until the tips of the fingers touch the floor in front of the body.  They are performed among persons of similar rank.

Students of tea ceremony bow to each other and to their teacher; each class begins with bows between the teacher and students.  If a senior student is teaching a junior student, bows are exchanged between the two.  Before beginning a practice, a student bows to all the other students as well.  This pattern is repeated when the practice ends.  

A bow is performed at the door before entering the tea room, or tea house.  One then proceeds to the tokonoma, or scroll alcove, and bows again.  Finally one greets the teacher, and then the other students, or the other guests, with bows.  This pattern is repeated when leaving the tea room as well.

The host of a tea cereomony bows before beginning the ceremony.  Bows are exchanged repeatedly throughout a tea ceremony, between the host and guest of honour, among the guests, between guests and the hosts assistants, and between the host and guests.

Bowing in religious settings.

Bows are performed both in Shinto and Buddhist settings.  Korean Zen Buddhism has a daily ritual in which practitioners do 1,080 full prostration bows, usually spread throughout the day.  More casual practitioners and laypeople typically do 108 bows once a day instead.  

Visitors to a Shinto shrine will clap or ring a bell to attract the attention of the enshrined deity, clasp the hands in prayer, and then bow.

For bowing in Islam see Ruk'u.

Bowing in Christian liturgy.

In Christian liturgy, bowing is a sign of respect or deference.  In many traditions, individuals will bow when passing in front of the altar, or at certain points in the service (for example, when the name of Jesus Christ is spoken). It may take the form of a simple bow of the head, or a slight incline of the upper body. A profound bow is a deep bow from the waist, and is often done as a substitution for genuflection. 

For bowing in Eastern Orthodoxy, see zemnoy poklon.

Bowing in Jewish settings.
In Jewish setting, bowing, like Christianity, is a sign of respect, and is done at certain points in the Jewish services. This is done by merely bending the knees, and then, while straightening the knees, bending the upper body forward. After a few seconds, the congregant returns to the standing position. Most importantly during the concluding Aleinu section of the services, congregants will bow when they say "V'anachnu korim umishtachavim u'modim," meaning "we bend our knees, bow, and acknowledge our thanks." Another moment in the service which triggers the bow is during the "Bar'chu." Many bow at the mention of "Adonai" (the Jewish addressing of the Lord) at this and various other parts in the service (most likely if they are to remain standing during that prayer).

<doc id="1153333" title="War of Tatters" nonfiltered="427" processed="423" dbindex="1480430">


War of Tatters (in Portuguese: Guerra dos Farrapos) was a Republican uprising that began in the southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina) in 1835. The rebels, led by generals Bento Gonçalves da Silva and Antônio de Souza Netto with the support of the Italian warrior Giuseppe Garibaldi, surrendered to imperial forces in 1845. The war rushed the coronation of Dom Pedro II, at that time a 15 year old, in direct violation of Brazilian constitution. It is considered the bloodiest civil war to have ever occurred in Brazil.

 The war . 

Apparently the uprising began due to the secondary role that the Rio Grande do Sul state played in Brazilian regencial politics because, unlike the other provinces, the state economy focused in the internal market rather than exporting commodities.  The state's main product, the charque (bovine dried and salted meat), suffered the hard competition of charque from Uruguay and Argentina, which had free access to Brazilian market while the gauchos had to pay high taxes inside Brazil.

To keep the south border safe from foreign invasion, Rio Grande do Sul had a high war awareness and many military outposts. A few years before, the Argentina-Brazil War was fought there, but there was little political gain. The army leaders and province governor were still sent by the Imperial capital, Rio de Janeiro. 

In 1835 Antônio Rodrigues Fernandes Braga was nominated as province president. At first his name pleased the liberal farmers, but that soon changed. In his first day in the office, he accused nominally many farmers of being separatists. 

On September 19, 1835, General Bento Gonçalves captured the capital Porto Alegre, beginning the uprising. The province president fled to Rio Grande, 200km south, and the rebels, also known as Farroupilhas, elected Marciano Pereira Ribeiro as the new president. The Brazilian regent, Diogo Feijó, appointed a new president to the province, who should have taken office in Porto Alegre; instead he went to Rio Grande to take the presidency. This further upset the rebels.

On September 20, 1836, Antônio de Souza Netto declared the independence of the Piratini Republic. Bento Gonçalves was nominated as president. However, soon after it, Bento was arrested by imperial forces and jailed. Bento escaped from prison in 1837, went back to the province and took the revolution to its zenith. It was already possible to imagine an independent Piratini Republic. But the war still had many turnarounds. Porto Alegre was recaptured by the empire and the rebels never managed to conquer it again.

The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the rebels in 1839. With his help the revolution spread through Santa Catarina, in the northern border of Rio Grande do Sul. Laguna was taken but after only four months it fell into imperial hands once again.

 Peace .

Amnesty was offered to the rebels in 1840, which they refused although it was clear that they had no chances of winning. In 1842 a republican constitution was issued, as a last effort of rebels. In the same year general Lima e Silva (soon Duke of Caxias) took office and tried to find a diplomatic settlement to the issue.

In 1845, the peace negotiations led by Lima e Silva and Davi Canabarro (replacing Bento Gonçalves) ended. March 1, 1845 was celebrated the Ponche Verde Treaty. It included:
full amnesty;
the rebel soldiers would be incorporated to the imperial army;
the Farroupilhas would choose the next province president (they chose Lima e Silva, due to his noble and decent position during the peace talks);
the debts of the short-lived republic would be paid by the Empire;
taxation of 25% to the imported charque.

InterPress is a page description language developed at Xerox PARC, based on the Forth programming language and an earlier graphics language called JaM. As with many PARC projects, Interpress was not commercialized at its time of creation, and its primary effect on the world was to cause some of its creators (Chuck Geschke and John Warnock) to get fed up, form their own company, and publish their own version. The company in this case was Adobe Systems, and their version is known as PostScript. InterPress was used in some Xerox printers, and supported in Xerox Ventura Publisher, but it is not clear whether or not it achieved significant market-share. InterPress was also used as the output format for PARC's InterScript system, which was an editable word processor format for rich documents.

A Hyfrecator is a versatile diathermical medical apparatus used in electrosurgery. It works by emitting low-power electrical pulses via a probe directly to the affected area of the body. The amount of output power needed is adjustable, and the device is equipped with a myriad number of tips, electrodes and forceps depending on the electrosurgical requirement.

The hyfrecator has a large number of uses, such as removal of warts, dessication of sebaceous gland disorders, electrocautery, epilation, plastic surgery and many other dermatological tasks. It is also instrumental in the destruction of skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma.

The hyfrecator can be used in almost all fields of medicine, including, chiropody, dentistry, ophthalmology, gynaecology and veterinary medicine to name a few.

Hasan Alkhayer (died 1980) (Arabic           ) was a Syrian poet born in Qardaha, Syria. 

He was known for his abomination of sectarianism and for his altruism. He was a candid voice of patriotism. His most famous work is a poem called "What Do I Say?" in which he sarcastically and invincibly criticized both the austere regime and soulless and sanctimonous militant terrorists who together crippled life in Syria in late 1970s and early 1980s. He was kidnapped and killed, probably by the regime, in 1980. His body was never located. This fate made him known by some in the Arab world, though not in Syria, as the Lorca of Arabs. It's not known much about other works by him. Alkhayer may have been an Alawite.

David Potts (born on 15 July 1970 in Farnworth, Bolton, Lancashire, England), known to bandmates and fans as "Pottsy", is the ex-frontman of Monaco, and is currently guitarist and lead singer for RAM.

Career.
In the early 1990's, Potts was working as a tape operator during recording sessions for Peter Hook's Revenge. After the departure of Dave Hicks, Potts was unexpectedly drafted into the band. Struggling from the beginning, Revenge eventually fell apart, with Hook and Potts being the only members left. They continued on as a two-piece, Monaco, with Hook on bass guitar and vocals, and Potts on drums, guitar, keyboards, vocals, and sometimes backing Hook on bass.  They recorded the hit "What Do You Want From Me" in 1997, which reached #11 on the British music charts. The album Music For Pleasure also reached #11 and produced two more singles, "Sweet Lips" (which reached #18) and "Shine" (which did not chart). After three years of frustration with their record company, Polydor Records, Monaco's self-titled follow-up was released on a different label, and despite severe underpromotion and lack of a strong single, received generally good reviews.

Around this time, tensions were mounting in the studio, due to Potts' unbelievable workload and his dissatisfaction with the band's failure to depart from a New Order-like sound. This was highlighted by what Potts called "a disastrous gig" at the Eclipse festival, where Hook and Potts were in a massive argument. They both took a break, and after letting things cool down, got together and decided it was best to split up Monaco. Around this time, Oasis rhythm guitarist Paul Arthurs and bassist Paul McGuigan had departed from the band, and Potts was found on the shortlist of possible replacements for McGuigan due to his connection with one of the band's roadies. Briefly contacted by Noel Gallagher, Potts rehearsed with the band on bass. Andy Bell was eventually selected as McGuigan's replacement. Potts later said that although the band was "a charming bunch of lads", he wanted to be his own boss, and did not pursue the position for two reasons: a fear of getting sacked in a matter of weeks (something Oasis is notable for), and a general distaste for playing the bass guitar.

Potts then formed RAM, a nod to McCartney, with friends Steve Brannan and Paul Kehoe receiving lots of positive press for their psychedelic-influenced pop/rock sound. Their 'Songs on Page One' EP and single 'For Your Love' were critically acclaimed.

Pottsy released an EP 'I'm The Greatest' in November 2006 followed by a new album 'Coming Up For Air' in January 2007 under the name David Potts. He also participated in the New Order tribute album project Community 2: A NewOrderOnline Tribute.

His new album, entitled 'Coming Up For Air' will be released January 29th 2007.

<doc id="8967577" title="National Minimum Data Set for Social Care" nonfiltered="433" processed="429" dbindex="1480436">


 Objective .

The primary objective of the NMDS-SC is to generate improved sector wide strategic workforce intelligence to support the strategic planning of Skills for Care and stakeholders in the wider social care sector.

In October 2005 Skills for Care launched the National Minimum Data Set for social care (NMDS-SC). The original idea for the data set was thought up by Francis Ward,
Head of Skills Research & Intelligence at Skills for Care. The aim being a data set that will enable a coherent approach to information collection which has relevance to employers and the ability to provide an up-to-date picture of the social care sector that can be used to meet a variety of needs. These needs will include 'Strategic planning for workforce development at a national or regional level'.

 Features .
For employers the NMDS-SC will provide true labour market information to assist in the strategic planning for the future needs of people who use social care services and will identify employee skills, needs and achievements.

The NMDS-SC provides an opportunity to raise standards of care and improve the image of the social care sector. The Skills Research & Intelligence Unit is also engaged in a range of other research activity that exports issues relevant to policy development and service provision within the social care sector. An example of this would be research that is currently being undertaken to explore issues associated with "direct payments".

The Clan MacDonald of Keppoch is a Highland Scottish clan and is a branch of the main Clan Donald or Macdonald.

History.

The MacDonalds of Keppoch are descended from Alistair Carrach Macdonald. Alistair Carrach MacDonald was the 4th son of Good John Macdonald of Islay who was the chief of Clan Donald and 7th Lord of the Isles.

For his involvement in the 1431 inserrection of Donald Balloch, Alistair Carrach had a large portion of his lands removed and transferd to the Chief of the Clan MacKintosh.

In 1497 some of the Clan MacLaren stole cattle from the Braes of Lochaber from the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch. The MacDonalds followed them and overtook them at a place called Glenurchy where a battle took place. The MacDonalds won and recovered their cattle. However the MacLarens then looked for assistance from Dugel Stuart of Appin. Another battle then took place where the MacLarens were now joined by the Stuarts against the MacDonalds. During the battle Dugel, the chief of Clan Stuart and the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch chief were both killed.  

The 12th Chief of the Clan Macdonald of Keppoch called Alexander along with his brother was slain in 1663 in what is remembered as in gaelic as Tobair-nan-ceann meaning the Well of Heads, not far from Invergarry. This is where the heads of severn murderers were washed before presentation to the Lord MacDonnell of Invergarry.

During the Jacobite Uprisings the son of the 15th Chief of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch was among the men who attacked British government soldiers who were preparing a surprise assault on the Glenfinnan gathering. This was the first strike on the government during the 1745 to 1746 uprising. This son of the chief later died at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.

Castle.

The original seat of the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch was at Tom 'a Charraigh at Torlundy et al.

Septs of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch.

Septs of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch include the following. Other branches of the Clan MacDonald have different septs. 

Alexander, Sanderson, MacGillivantic, MacGilp, Macglasrich, MacKillop, MacPhilip, Philipson, Ronald, Ronaldson. 


The family of MacRanald, now mainly spelled McReynolds, was also a branch of the Keppoch's.  A very ancient and rare name in Scotland.

Harry Corwin Nixon (April 1, 1891-October 22, 1961) was a Canadian politician and briefly Premier of Ontario.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1919 as a candidate of the United Farmers of Ontario. He served as a Cabinet minister in the government of Premier Ernest C. Drury as Provincial Secretary and Registrar. Following the defeat of the UFO-Labour government in the 1923 election, Nixon sat as a Progressive Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), and became the leader of the small Progressive bloc (as most UFOers now called themselves) after the 1929 election. 

Mitchell Hepburn, a farmer, became leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, and Nixon led his Progressive remnant into an alliance with Hepburn's party. In the 1934 election, Nixon and his followers ran as Liberal-Progressives, helping bring the Hepburn to power. He ran again as a Liberal-Progressive in the 1937 election. 

Nixon resumed his former Cabinet position of Provincial Secretary and Registrar in the Hepburn cabinet and was the senior minister in the government. During World War II, Hepburn clashed with William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Liberal Prime Minister of Canada, arguing that King was not sufficiently prosecuting the war effort, in particular by not introducing conscription (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). Hepburn openly supported King's rival, Conservative leader Arthur Meighen in a 1942 York South by-election, and seemed to be calling for the defeat of King. This was too much for many Ontario Liberals, who were either King loyalists or feared a rift between the federal and provincial parties. Hepburn was forced to resign on October 21, 1942. 

Nixon was widely seen as the "heir apparent", and had earlier turned down Hepburn's offer to appoint him Premier as Nixon insisted the leadership should be the choice of the party, not of Hepburn. However, Hepburn, while resigning as Premier, insisted on remaining as party leader, and simply appointed his ally, Gordon Daniel Conant as the new Premier of Ontario on October 21, 1942. Nixon resigned from the cabinet on October 22, 1942 in opposition to Hepburn's refusal to allow a leadership convention to elect a new leader. Conant was forced to resign after only six months due to serious divisions in the party, and a leadership convention was called. Nixon was chosen as Liberal leader and Premier in May 1943, but his government was unable to win the election held three months later, and the Liberals were reduced to third place behind George Drew's Progressive Conservatives and Ted Jolliffe's Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.

Harry Nixon remained a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP)1 until his death in 1961. His son, Robert Nixon succeed him as MPP, and later became leader of the Liberal Party but never Premier. He served as Treasurer in the Cabinet of David Peterson from 1985-1990. Harry Nixon's granddaughter (and Robert Nixon's daughter) Jane Stewart served as a Cabinet minister in the federal Liberal government of Jean Chrétien.

1 In 1938, Members of the Ontario Legislative Assembly (MLAs) passed a motion to adopt the title "Members of Provincial Parliament" (MPP).

Slitherlink (also known as Fences, Loop the Loop, Ouroboros and Dotty Dilemma) is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. As of 2005, 17 books consisting entirely of Slitherlink puzzles have been published by Nikoli.

Rules.
Slitherlink is played on a rectangular lattice of dots. Some of the squares formed by the dots have numbers inside them. The objective is to connect horizontally and vertically adjacent dots so that the lines form a single loop with no loose ends. In addition, the number inside a square represents how many of its four sides are segments in the loop.

Solution Methods.

Whenever the number of lines around a cell matches the number in the cell, the other potential lines can be eliminated. This is usually done with an X. 

A key to many deductions in Slitherlink is that every point has either exactly two lines connected to it, or no lines. For example:
 If a 1 is in a corner, the actual corner's lines may be X'ed out, because a line that entered said corner could not leave it except by passing by  the 1 again. This also applies if two lines leading into the 1-box at the same corner are X'ed out.
 If two 3s are adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically, their common edge must be filled in, because the only other option is a closed oval that is impossible to connect to any other line. Also, the two outer lines of the group (parallel to the common line) must be filled in.
 If two 3s are adjacent diagonally, the edges which do not run into the common point must be filled in.
 If the line reaches a corner of a 3, there must be lines on both sides of the 3 that said corner is not adjacent to, because if the 3's sole empty space were not adjacent to it, the corner would have three lines connected to it.

In an exceptionally difficult puzzle, one may use another mathematical theorem, which states that any open curve that starts and ends outside of a closed curve must intersect the closed curve an even number of times. In particular, this means that any row of vertical lines or any column of horizontal lines must have an even number of lines. When only one potential line segment in one of these groups is unknown, you can determine whether it is part of the loop or not with this theorem.

A simple strategy to assist in using this theorem is to "paint" (sometimes called "shade") the outside and the inside areas. When you see two outside cells, or two inside cells be next to each other then you know that there is not a line between them.

History.
Slitherlink is an original puzzle of Nikoli; it first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #26 (June 1989).
The editor combined two original puzzles contributed there, and it was 
completed.
At first, every square contained a number.

John Peyton (born July 28, 1964) is a politician of the Republican Party, serving as mayor of Jacksonville, Florida since July 1, 2003. He is only the second Republican mayor of the city since 1888. Elected at 38, he is one of the youngest mayors currently serving a city in Florida or any of the Southern United States. Peyton survived a crowded Republican primary and defeated the county's Democratic sheriff, Nat Glover, for the seat in a race (largely self funded) that was the most expensive in Jacksonville history.

His family's company, Gate Petroleum, is one of the largest privately held companies in the state and the family has made a considerable fortune buying and selling land to both the state and federal governments, as well as owning several resorts, including Ponte Vedra Inn and Club. Also connected to Gate is Florida Rock, which specializes in soil and aggregate. Prior to his election as mayor, Peyton served on the board of the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. His tenure was not without controversy; he faced a very substantial uproar in the community when he bypassed the organization's #2 man, an African American, to hire an outsider to run the Authority   a move that brought charges of racism against Peyton and the board. Less controversial positions included managing his family's company and serving as chairman for the Jacksonville Symphony Association and Greenscape of Jacksonville.

One of Peyton's achievements during his time in office has been RALLY Jacksonville!, an early literacy program aimed at four-year-olds. The program has served as a model for similar programs in other cities. A long-time bachelor, Peyton became engaged during his campaign and married Dr. Kathryn Pearson, a Jacksonville physician, shortly after he took office. They have one son, John Conner, born in 2005.  Peyton is a graduate of Mercer University and the Harvard Business School Executive Education Program.

"In God We Trust" was the seventh episode aired of TV comedy series Arrested Development.

Synopsis.

Michael Bluth has called a meeting with his family's longtime attorney, Barry Zuckerkorn to discuss his father's incarceration. But he is finding it difficult to find any answers. He is, however, getting along with his sister, Lindsay, which is unwelcome news to their mother Lucille.

The over-billing attorney does arrange for the court to allow their father out of jail for an entire afternoon so he could participate in the Living Classics pageant, which consists of live representations of classic works of art. The Bluths have always been a part of Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam", although Buster is reluctant to play the part of Adam this year, since he already has plans with Lucille Austero. Tobias, who is still looking to further his acting career, offers to take the part, but Lucille wants Buster to do it.

Unimpressed by the results, Michael is determined to drop Barry Zuckerkorn as family attorney for the very businesslike Wayne Jarvis. After the meeting breaks up, Lucille makes her play on Lindsay, mentioning in passing that Michael called her a "stay in bed mom" in her attempt to dissolve their burgeoning friendship. And her daughter, Maeby, feeling ignored by her parents, decides to make her parents think she is planning to run away to teach them a lesson.

G.O.B., meanwhile, has missed the meeting after being delayed by his girlfriend Marta. And while G.O.B. takes his girlfriend for granted, Michael is learning Spanish to grow closer to her. Unfortunately, the one tape he could find, "Spanish for Businessmen," is of little use to him.

Buster is trying to get George Michael to take over his role as Adam this year, which George Michael is uninterested in doing until he receives a compliment from his secret crush, Maeby, about the muscular shape the Adam suit makes under his clothes. Simultaneously, Lindsay confronts Michael about what Lucille told her, which wakes them both up to the fact that their mother is playing them against each other. Michael and Lindsay proceed to drink a bottle of vodka and air their problems to each other. Lindsay tells Michael that her marital difficulties are partly because Tobias is a never-nude, and Michael confesses to Lindsay that he is in love with G.O.B.'s girlfriend Marta.

George Michael is still trying to show off his fake muscles for Maeby, who is still unable to make her parents notice her hints about running away. Just then, Tobias comes into their bedroom, and asks to speak to George Michael alone, much to Maeby's frustration. Tobias asks George Michael if he can play Adam in the pageant, and George Michael agrees, but said he will have to give him the suit later since he is wearing it, which Tobias interprets to mean that George Michael is also a never-nude.

Michael finally arranges a meeting with attorney Wayne Jarvis, a professional who doesn't like small talk. When Lucille enters the office for the meeting, she first tells Michael that Lindsay planned to get him drunk to get the money she needed for her credit card.

At home, G.O.B. racks his brain to find out what Michael is up to with learning Spanish and hiring a new attorney. Lucille advises getting him drunk to find out. And Lindsay, noticing a bouquet of flowers with a note "Can't wait for the pageant! Your Hopeful Lawyer", chides Lucille about getting close to Barry and tells her mother that the plan to drive a wedge between Lindsay and Michael isn't working. To which Lucille replies by telling Lindsay that Michael told her about Tobias's "Never nude" condition, which Lindsay had secretly confided to Michael. Lindsay storms down to Michael's office to berate him, and they once again realize they have been played by their mother. Only this time, they decide they have to teach her a lesson. When Michael finds out Barry Zuckerkorn is taking Lucille to the Living Classics pageant on a date, they realize how embarrassed she would be if George Bluth Sr. finds out.

 Maeby, meanwhile, is trying a last-ditch effort to get her parents' attention by printing out a fake airline ticket to Portugal. And while neither Lindsay nor Tobias see the ticket, G.O.B. does, which confirms his suspicions that Michael is planning to flee the country. And George Michael begins to grow nervous about the pageant after realizing that playing Adam means having to wear the "frontispiece", tiny foam genitalia.

George Sr. gets his 24 hours of freedom as the pageant finally begins. Michael and Lindsay arrive, and are surprised to find Lucille accompanied by Wayne Jarvis, not Barry Zuckerkorn. Lucille, meanwhile, is surprised to see Buster with her rival, Lucille Austero. George Michael causes a scandal by wearing a pair of cut-off jeans over his costume. But the biggest scandal comes when George Sr., dressed as God, tries to escape from the pageant. Michael chases after his father, and G.O.B. chases after Michael, confronting him with his suspicions, and all three knock each other onto the ground. When George Sr. finds out Lucille is on a date, he tries to run back, only to be tasered into submission by a prison guard.

And so the Bluths spend Christmas Eve together at the prison, where Michael is forced to once again rely on Barry.  Lucille and Maeby decide that they should spend more time together, and Michael and Lindsay realize that perhaps keeping their friendship isn't as important as they thought.

Episode notes.

Although this episode comes before My Mother, The Car in both Broadcast and Production order, it appears after it on the Season One DVD. Technically, My Mother, the Car SHOULD come first, as Buster and Lucille Austero start their relationship in that episode, and go on their first date in this one.
This episode is considered to be the Christmas episode of the first season. Very little mention is made of Christmas in the episode, but Christmas decorations are shown throughout, and the episode's soundtrack consists mainly of several Christmas carols, including "Joy to the World", "Sleigh Ride", and "Jingle Bells".  A string quarter also performs Handel's "Messiah" - traditionally performed during the Christmas season - when the Bluths' contribution to the Pageant is unveiled.
This episode does not feature an "On the next episode of Arrested Development..." segment.

References.
The Creation of Adam - The Creation of Adam is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist Michelangelo, and part of his series of paintings depicting Biblical stories from the Book of Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In it, a bearded and robed God reaches out to a fully nude Adam, symbolizing God's creation of the first man in his own image.
 
Pageant of the Masters - The Orange County "Living Classics" pageant depicted in this episode parodies this real-life annual living statue show where local volunteers reproduce several dozen famous artworks in an evening (with the help of elaborate costumes and makeup). The Pageant (actually located in Laguna Beach, California) is the only show of its type and scale in western North America.
Bruce Vilanch - An American comedy writer who became famous starring on a revival of the television show Hollywood Squares. He often provides jokes for other performers such as Billy Crystal and Bette Midler, and is a frequent joke writer for the Academy Awards and other American award shows.
Pilates - A physical fitness system developed in the early 20th century by Joseph Pilates. During the early 21st century, it experienced a revival and became a popular fitness fad in America, particularly among celebrities and the wealthy.
Tahitian Women (On the Beach) - The other painting shown reenacted for the Living Classics pageant is a rendition of this work by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin.

Callbacks/Running Jokes.
Barry is Gay - We are given the first hints that attorney Barry Zuckerkorn is secretly a practicing homosexual.
His numerous defamatory remarks about homosexuals indicate that Barry is homophobic, which Sigmund Freud claimed was a sign of repressed homosexuality.
When asking George Sr. about homosexual prisoners, Barry makes the Freudian slip, "it's never the ones you hope".
Corn dog - This is the first time Tobias is seen eating a corn dog (another hint at his questionable sexuality), which he later does again in Let 'Em Eat Cake.
"He's very good" - Throughout this episode, Lucille keeps saying "He's very good" about Barry, something that we later learn is a phrase that Barry came up with to advertise himself. This phrase is occasionally used in several later episodes, including ¡Amigos! and The Righteous Brothers.
We see an advertisement for Barry on a park bench in this episode that reads, "He s very good." This was paralleled in Burning Love when we see a Spanish language park bench advertisement for Barry reading  Es el mejor. ;
Lesson - Maeby attempts many times during the first season to teach a lesson to her oblivious parents, seen previously in Pilot and Key Decisions.

Never Nude - This is the first episode we learn about Tobias's affliction, and several references are made.
We see Tobias demonstrating his affliction in several places, such as a doctor's office and wearing cut-off jeans underneath a Speedo.
Tobias thinks George Michael is a never-nude because he is wearing the muscle suit underneath his clothes.
Tobias shouts out that there are "dozens of us" while defending George Michael for wearing cut-off jeans over his costume at the pageant.
Party - Here we see another of Lucille's many parties for the family, this one celebrating Christmas.
Portugal - This is the first time G.O.B. displays his lack of knowledge about Portugal, saying that it is in South America. Additionally, since the primary language of Portugal is Portuguese, his logic regarding Michael learning Spanish to move there is somewhat flawed.
South America - G.O.B. assumes Michael is running away to South America, an idea he would decide to try himself in the next episode, My Mother, The Car.
The Spanish Language - When G.O.B. goes to leave Marta's house, she calls out 'Te quiero!', which G.O.B. asks for her to translate.
Wig - This is the first instance of George Sr.'s tendency to escape wearing a wig, which he'd try again in The One Where Michael Leaves.

Hidden/Background Jokes.
Food - After G.O.B. says,  If I have to smell another meal of fish, rice and mango, I m going to kill somebody,  Lupe, who is eating a meal in the background, stops and replaces the cover on her Tupperware container.
Lupe's sweatshirt - During the Christmas party, Lupe is wearing a Halloween-themed  BOO!  sweatshirt, the first instance of Lupe wearing an out-of-date sweatshirt, seen next in Marta Complex.

Character Cameos.
This episode marks the first appearance of several recurring characters.
John Michael Higgins as attorney Wayne Jarvis, though he would return as the prosecutor leading the case against the Bluths in Sad Sack.
Henry Winkler would return many times throughout the first and second season as closeted and incompetent attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.
Sam Pancake reappeared as Barry's homosexual paralegal in Let 'Em Eat Cake and Sad Sack.
Patricia Velasquez appears for the first time as Spanish-language soap opera star Marta Estrella. Taking the role over from Leonor Varela, many fans refer to her portrayal of the character as "Marta 2.0". In interviews, some cast members have indicated that she was the favorite of the two actresses.
This is the second appearance of BW Gonzales as Lucille's housekeeper Lupe, though she would not have a speaking part until Marta Complex.

Foreshadowing/Future References.
George Sr. Escape Attempt - This is the first instance we see of George Sr. attempting to escape, a feat he would try again several times during the course of the show, and later succeed in Let 'Em Eat Cake.
Gangee as a Monster - Lucille Bluth claims that her children turned her into a monster, and then accused her of being one, to which Maeby responded "I don't think you're a monster." This foreshadows Maeby's future depiction of Gangee as a monster later in Making a Stand.

Goofs.
Continuity - In this episode, Buster and Lucille 2 go on their first date together. However, in the next episode, My Mother, The Car, Buster confronts Lucille 2 about their recent misunderstandings, where they then kiss and begin a relationship. Technically, for Buster and Lucille 2's relationship to make sense, My Mother, the Car must be seen BEFORE In God We Trust (this episode order problem was later corrected on the Season One DVD).
Continuity - At 4:22, there is a cut.  In the first shot, there's a man leaning on a lightpost in the background.  In the second shot, that man is gone.

<doc id="8384670" title="Fort Wayne Philharmonic Orchestra" nonfiltered="448" processed="443" dbindex="1480451">

The Fort Wayne Philharmonic Orchestra is a professional orchestra based in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  The orchestra's music director is Edvard Tchivzhel (born 1944), a native of Russia.  The assistant conductor is Bradley Thachuk, a native of Canada.  The orchestra performs mainly in the historic Embassy Centre and the Arts United Center.

History.
The orchestra was founded in 1944.  It has been part of the city's musical heritage continuously since its debut in October 1944, and dramatically expanded its concert programming in the 1945-1946 season, presenting 14 programs with pianist William Kapell, violinist Yehudi Menuhin and tenor Mario Lanza among the guest artists. Over the years, the Philharmonic has performed with many renowned pop artists, including Benny Goodman, Skitch Henderson, Burt Bacharach, Aretha Franklin, Doc Severinsen, The Smothers Brothers, Henry Mancini, Pete Fountain, and Air Supply.

Prior to Tchivzhel, the orchestra's music director was Ronald Ondrejka, who had previously served as music director of the Monterey Symphony Orchestra (1960-61), assistant conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra (1961-63) under Josef Krips, and conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.  Ondrejka, who frequently programmed American music, was also actively involved with the music program at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Among other former music directors of the Philharmonic was Igor Buketoff (1914-2001), who made numerous recordings and was known for his educational work.  He was particularly known for his performances of Russian music, especially Rachmaninoff, and he contributed to Vox's multi-disc tribute to early American Louis Moreau Gottschalk (1829-1969).  The New York Times reported that Buketoff died in New York City on September 7, 2001, at the age of 87.



The Orchestra Today.
Today, the Fort Wayne Philharmonic carries on its musical tradition under the direction of Edvard Tchivzhel. Its 480 orchestra and chamber ensemble performances are attended by more than 220,000 people.  Since 1980 the orchestra has won five awards for adventuresome programming" from ASCAP, the American Society of composers, Authors and Publishers. In addition, its Education Programs are created to inspire the love of classical music in people of all ages.  The Fort Wayne Philharmonic Chorus, directed by Robert Nance, participates in several concerts each year.

The current season runs from September through May.  Concerts are divided into several categories:

Masterworks Series - devoted to major orchestral works, sometimes with instrumental and/or vocal soloists, usually at the Embassy Centre.

Spectrum Series - devoted to works for chamber orchestra, sometimes with soloists drawn from orchestra principals, usually held at the Arts United Center, featuring narration by the conductor.

Pops Concerts - devoted to light works, often featuring guest soloists and/or conductors, usually held at the Embassy Centre.

"Unplugged" Concerts - very informal, "bargain" concerts with the musicians informally dressed, usually held at the Arts United Center, with narration by the conductor.

Freimann Series - chamber music concerts featuring principal players of the Philharmonic, held in various venues.

Broadcasts and Recordings.
The Masterworks/Grand and Spectrum concerts are usually taped for broadcast on Fort Wayne's WBNI.

Edvard Tchivzhel and the Philharmonic recorded a commercial CD at the Honeywell Center in Wabash, which includes Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 and Richard Strauss' symphonic poem Don Juan.

Tchivzhel To Leave.
On January 17, 2007, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette reported that Edvard Tchivzhel, music director of the Fort Wayne Philharmonic, will step down when his contract expires in June 2008.

Tchivzhel, born in Leningrad, Russia (now St. Petersburg), in 1944, came to Fort Wayne in August 1993 after serving as assistant director of the Leningrad Philharmonic (now called the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra) under Yevgeny Mravinsky.

Tchivzhel is also artistic director of the Greenville Symphony Orchestra in South Carolina.  The Fort Wayne Philharmionic's 2007-08 season, Tchivzhel s last, will be assembled to reflect and celebrate the maestro s contributions to the orchestra.  The Philharmonic said a search committee would be formed.

<doc id="53514" title="Edith Cavell" nonfiltered="450" processed="445" dbindex="1480453">




Edith Louisa Cavell (December 4, 1865 October 12, 1915) is a World War I heroine.

Edith Cavell was born in 1865 at Swardeston in Norfolk, where her father, the Reverend Frederick Cavell, was Vicar for 45 years.  She trained as a nurse at The Royal London Hospital and in 1907 was appointed matron of the Berkendael Institute in Brussels, Belgium.  When World War I broke out, the hospital was taken over by the Red Cross.  Nurse Cavell is alleged to have helped hundreds of soldiers from the allied forces to escape from occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands, in violation of military law. In 1915, she was arrested and court-martialled by the Germans for this offence.  UK and US diplomats disagreed about whether anything could be done to help her case, with Sir Horace Rowland, from the Foreign Office suggesting "I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell, I am afraid we are powerless." The sentiment was echoed by Lord Robert Cecil, who joined the coalition government in 1915 as an under secretary for foreign affairs after working for the Red Cross. "Any representation by us," he advised, "will do her more harm than good."

Representing the United States, which had not yet joined the war, Hugh Gibson, First Secretary of the American legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm their nation's already damaged reputation. In a statement issued afterward, he noted: "We reminded him (Baron von der Lancken) of the burning of Louvain and the sinking of the Lusitania, and told him that this murder would stir all civilized countries with horror and disgust. Count Harrach broke in at this with the rather irrelevant remark that he would rather see Miss Cavell shot than have harm come to one of the humblest German soldiers, and his only regret was that they had not 'three or four English old women to shoot.'"

She made no defence admitting her actions and was executed by firing squad at 2am on October 12, becoming a popular martyr and entering British history as a heroine. The execution took place at the Tir National, a State military site (today a memorial, near the State television buildings), where she was buried. Edith Cavell's case became an important article of British propaganda throughout the war . The German medical officer assisting was the expressionist poet Gottfried Benn (1886-1956), who gave an account of the event.

The night before her execution she told the Anglican chaplain, Rev. Gahan, who had been allowed to see to give her Holy Communion, "Patriotism is not enough, I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone." These words are inscribed on her statue in St. Martin's Place, near Trafalgar Square in London.

Her final words to the German pastor, Le Saur were recorded as 'Ask Mr. Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.'

After the war Edith Cavell's body was exhumed and returned to the UK. A memorial service at Westminster Abbey led by King George V was followed by travel by special train to Thorpe Station, Norwich. She was reburied on Life's Green, at the east end of Norwich Cathedral. Every year a service is held before the grave.

 Memorials .
Following her death, many memorials were created around the world to remember Cavell. One of the first occurred in 1917 when Queen Alexandra unveiled a monument near her grave in Norwich in front of a home for nurses which also bore her name.

Other memorials include:
An inscription on a war memorial, naming the 35 people executed by the German Army outside the gaol in which they were killed.
Mount Edith Cavell, a peak in the Canadian Rockies, named in 1916.
Cavell Corona, a geological feature on Venus.
Hospitals in Peterborough and the Brussel's borough of Uccle (Ukkel), a wing of the Toronto Western Hospital, schools in Vancouver, British Columbia, St. Catharines, Ontario and Bedford, England, and a bridge in New Zealand. ;

Edith became a popular French and Belgian girls' name after her execution. The French chanteuse Édith Piaf was the best known.

 Im Krapfenwald'l  (In Krapfen's Woods) op. 336 is a polka by Johann Strauss II written in 1869 and was originally titled 'Im Pawlowsk Walde' (In the Pavlovsk Woods) when first performed in Pavlovsk on 6 September (= 25 August Russian calendar) 1869. Reportedly, several encores of the piece was called for and Strauss felt moved to retitled the piece to suit his audience back in native Vienna. 

The new title 'Im Krapfenwald'l' alludes to the popular Krapfenwald area of the Wienerwald located in the scenic village of Grinzing and the heights of Cobenzl and Kahlenberg. The piece may also refer to the owner of the local tavern 'Krapfenwaldel', Franz Josef Krapf who opened his establishment at the same area. Eduard Strauss, who was responsible for performing many of his elder brother's works dating from his Russian tour first performed the work in Vienna at the Vienna Volksgarten on 24 June 1870 where it enjoyed greater admiration.

The work which hints strongly at the Viennese Woods backdrop calls for bird whistles which adorn the polka. Strauss has the last laugh when he calls for one of these birdsong in the closing moments of this cheerful work before a rushed ending with percussions and a flourish.

 EnSight .

EnSight refers to an animation, data visualization and post-processing software package.  EnSight is typically used in fields such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and in multi-physics applications such as Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI).
Common tasks associated with post-processing analysis of flow solver (e.g. Fluent, STAR-CD, FLOW-3D, OpenFOAM for CFD and Nastran, ABAQUS, ANSYS, LS-Dyna, MSC.Adams for FEA) can include:
calculating quantities (e.g. flow rate, pressure loss)
Normalizing data; Deriving flow field functions like pressure coefficient or vorticity magnitude
Interactively exploring data through cut planes (a slice through a region), iso-surfaces (3-D maps of concentrations), particle paths (dropping a massless or massed object in the "fluid" and watching where it goes).  Other uses can be to fly-thru a complex structure or assembly, or explode it to reveal inner workings and structures by means of camera motions and/or transparency and/or part motion relative to the assembly.  EnSight is developed by Computational Engineering International in Apex, North Carolina.  EnSight came from earliear software known as MPGS (multi-purpose graphics system) from Cray Computers in the late 1980s.

<doc id="2834331" title="Watlington, Oxfordshire" nonfiltered="455" processed="450" dbindex="1480458">
Watlington in Oxfordshire, UK, is a small, quiet market town of just under 3,000 inhabitants,  located in the Chiltern Hills south of Oxford and north of Reading, Berkshire. The M40 motorway, which links London to Birmingham, is only two and a half miles from the town centre. 

The famous walking route, the Icknield Way (an ancient route from Cromer in Norfolk to Avebury in Wiltshire), passes the town along the dry, high ground to the east, and Watlington is a convenient location to begin walks along it, with Watlington Hill and its "White Mark" a popular stopping point. The Watlington White Mark was originally designed by local squire Edward Horner, who felt that the Norman church of St Leonard, when viewed from his home, would appear more impressive if it looked as though it had a spire. He had this unusual folly cut into the chalk of Watlington Hill in 1764. It is 270 feet tall and 36 feet wide.    

Aside from this the most striking feature of Watlington is its market hall in the centre of the town, which was built in 1665. The Watlington area is likely to have been settled at an early date, encouraged by the proximity of the Icknield Way. The placename means 'settlement of Waecel's people' and this indicates occupation from around the 6th century. A 9th-century charter mentions eight 'manses' or major dwellings in Watlington and the Domesday survey of 1086 identifies the area as being an agricultural community valued at £610. The Town also has an Anglo-Saxon Church which forms an integral part of the town's architecture and functionality. 

It also is famous for the former Great Western Railway branchline from Watlington to Princes Risborough.  An oddity of this branch line is that Watlington Station was actually at Pyrton, around a mile from Watlington itself.  The station site remains as does the carriage shed, station building (although very overgrown) and the brickwork of the goods shed. The line has been comprehensively documented in two volumes entitled County Branchline - An Intimate Portrait by Paul Karau and Chris Turner, published by Wild Swan Press.

Watlington was also a site used in the English Civil War for housing troops: it is thought that John Hampden stayed in the town the night before the Battle of Chalgrove Field. 

The local MP for Watlington is Boris Johnson.

<doc id="347710" title="John Campbell Greenway" nonfiltered="456" processed="451" dbindex="1480459">

John Campbell Greenway (July 6, 1872   January 19, 1926) was an American mining, steel and railroad executive: a man of many trades in many states. He also had a distinguished career as a soldier, both cavalry and infantry.

Greenway was born in Huntsville, Alabama and attended Phillips Academy, Andover and then the University of Virginia although he graduated in 1895 from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University. His early employment as a furnace helper for the Carnegie Steel Company was brief, as he joined Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War. After earning a Silver Star for his courageous service at the Battle of San Juan Hill, he was recommended for promotion to brevet captain by Colonel Roosevelt. 

Beginning in 1899, Greenway held executive positions in a number of mine, steel, and railroad companies throughout Arizona. He invented the turbo log washer and built the town of Ajo. Greenway served for one year as a regent of the University of Arizona before the United States entered World War I. During the war, he was especially praised for his heroic conduct in battle and was cited for bravery at Cambrai. France awarded him the Croix de Guerre, the Legion of Honor, and the Croix de l'Etoile. He also received a Distinguished Service Cross. 

In 1919 Greenway became a colonel of the infantry, and three years later he was promoted to brigadier general. Full of stamina, John Greenway continued to be active in business until his death in 1926 in New York City. In 1930 Arizona placed Greenway's statue in the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection. Greenway's great great grandfather Dr. Ephraim McDowell's statue was placed in the National Statuary Hall in 1929 by Kentucky.

A major thoroughfare in Phoenix, Arizona, Greenway Road, and Greenway High School in Phoenix is named in his honor.

Sir John Knyvet or Knivett (d. February 16,1381) was an English lawyer and administrator. He was Chief Justice of the King's Bench from  1365 to 1372, and Lord Chancellor of England from 1372 to 1377.

Knyvett was eldest son of Richard Knyvet of Southwick, Northamptonshire, and a keeper of the "Forest of Clyve" (now part of Rockingham Forest). His mother was Joanna, a daughter and the heiress of Sir John Wurth. He married Eleanor, daughter of Ralph, Lord Basset of Weldon, and they had four sons and a daughter. He owned and improved Southwick Manor, which he inherited from his father; the house still survives today.

Knyvet was practicing in the courts as early as 1347; in 1357 he was called to the degree of Serjeant-at-law, and on 30 September 1361 was appointed a justice of the Court of common pleas. On 29 October 1365 he was raised to the office of Chief Justice of the King's bench. In the Parliament of 1362 he served as a "trier of petitions" for Aquitaine and other lands over sea, and afterwards in each Parliament down to 1380, except while he was Chancellor, as a trier of petitions for England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. 

On 30 June 1372, after the death of Sir Robert Thorpe, who had been appointed Chancellor in consequence of a petition by the commons that the great seal should be entrusted to laymen, Knyvet was appointed his successor - he held the office for four and a half years; three speeches which he made at the opening of Parliament in 1372, 1373, and 1376 respectively, are given in the  Rolls of Parliament . 

In January 1377 Edward III, under the influence of John of Gaunt, reverted to the custom of appointing ecclesiastical chancellors, and Adam de Houghton was appointed to succeed Knyvet on 11 January Knyvet did not again hold judicial office, though he was appointed with the two chief justices to decide a question between the Earl of Pembroke and William la Zouch of Haryngworth. He was an executor of the will of Edward III.

Knyvet held large estates both in Northamptonshire and East Anglia, and when he died in 1381 his descendants established themselves as an important family in Norfolk.

Delapré Abbey.

A member of the family, Katherine Knyvet, was elected as the Abbess of Delapré Abbey in Northampton in 1333. She died of the plague there in 1349.

Big I is the name of the freeway interchange where I-25 and I-40 intersect in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is the busiest interchange in the state, handling an average of 300,000 vehicles per day. The Big I was originally built in 1966 as a simple cloverleaf interchange designed to handle 60,000 vehicles per day. By the late 1990s, however, the it could no longer handle Albuquerque's increasing traffic flows and needed to be replaced. Construction work on a new interchange began in June 2000 and lasted until May 2002. The reconstruction, which was the largest public works project ever undertaken in New Mexico, cost $291 million and took just over three years to complete (including the design process).

The new Big I is a five-level stack interchange capable of handling 400,000 vehicles per day. It has eight main flyover bridges, which were constructed from 663 concrete segments precast at the site, as well as 47 smaller bridges. The largest flyover bridge, which connects southbound I-25 to eastbound I-40, is 2504 feet long, 85 feet high, and made up of 206 individual concrete segments.

Ties of Blood and Water is a fifth season episode of Star Trek: Deep Space 9.



A Cardassian named Ghemor is dying. He wishes to participate in a death-ritual where he would reveal many of his secrets. He chooses Kira, as she had unwillingly been forced to play the part of his daughter before (in Second Skin). Sisko encourages her to participate, as this could help the Federation and Bajor. 

Kira joins in. The ritual is later interupted by Dukat and other Cardassians. Dukat tells Kira about a massacre of Bajorans Ghemor had participated in. Infuriated, Kira leaves Ghemor. 

She soon learns the man would have only been ninteen at the time of the murders. Also, she recalls when she could not have been there for her real father, who died while she was fighting the Cardassians. Moved, she stays by Ghemor's side until the end.

<doc id="3862813" title="Partitas for keyboard (825?830)" nonfiltered="461" processed="456" dbindex="1480464">
The Partitas for keyboard (BWV 825 830) refer to a set of six suites written by the German composer Johann Sebastian Bach for harpsichord and are the last of Bach's 18 suites for keyboard, the others being the 6  English Suites (BWV 806-811) and the 6 French Suites (BWV 812 817).

Background.

Together, the six partitas form an exciting and, for the late Baroque, unique collection of keyboard pieces. Whilst many other composers were styling their works on more up-to-date fashions, Bach was adapting older formats, assimilating a variety of styles and synthesising these into a collection that is remarkable for its diversity and originality. 

Despite being published separately between 1726 and 1730, it was not until 1731 that JS Bach published his six partitas as a collected edition under the now-familiar title of Clavierübung (Keyboard Practice). Apart from two early Mülhausen cantatas that were written for council elections, they partitas were to become his first printed works of keyboard music, their title consciously referring to the suites of Bach s Leipzig predecessor Johann Kuhnau (1660-1722), whose own Clavier-übung was published some years previously. It was not for another four years before the second part of the Clavierübung was published, this time containing the Italian Concerto and the French Ouverture; each was an assimilation of the styles and tastes of their respective countries. A third part followed in 1739, which consisted of an organ setting of the Lutheran mass and its associated hymns, before the production of the fourth and final volume, in 1742, when Bach returned to the harpsichord for the publication of his monumental work, the Goldberg Variations.

Although Bach s later printed works were to be received somewhat coolly, the partitas achieved a considerable acceptance amongst his contemporaries. For example, the musical scholar Lorenz Christophe Mizler von Kolof (1711-1778) commented that  Whoever does not know how to place his fingers better will only with difficulty learn to play at the keyboard passages of our celebrated Herr Bach of Leipzig . Johann Nikolaus Forkel (1749-1818), Bach s first biographer, went further:  Whoever learned to play well several pieces from this work could make his fortune in the world with them . However, the importance of the collection lays not so much in their difficulty, but in a distinctive musical content that ranges from the elegance of the French style to the more up-to-date style galant.

It appears that seven partitas were planned initially; again, Kuhnau set the precedence with his publications, each of which contained seven suites. Although six was Bach s preferred number for instrumental sets (for example, the Brandenburg Concertos), the prefatory material to the initial publication of the fifth partita in 1730 indicated that another two were to follow.

The music and stylistic considerations.

Their keys are arranged ingeniously. Spreading outwards from B-flat major in a zigzag to c minor, a minor, D major, G major and E minor, which corresponds to the notes of the Greek hexachord. Given this pattern, one can speculate the key of the planned seventh partita was to be F major, which is incidentally the key of the Italian Concerto that opens the second part of the Clavierübung.

The partitas  movements and sequencing are oriented towards the model of the French suite, which, following the examples of such composers as Jean-Henri d Anglebert and Johann-Jakob Froberger, had become an established genre in Germany by the beginning of the eighteenth century. Bach had used a similar format in his so-called French Suites (BWV 812-817), the movements of which generally followed the following order: Allemande, Courante, Sarabande and Gigue. However, many dance styles had changed considerably from the early French models, favouring the more popular Italian style instead. Thus, we have more exciting Courantes and Gigues, where subtlety becomes a casualty in favour of quicker models, effused with sophisticated (and, in the words of some, retrospective) German counterpoint.

Each also contains a large-scale movement at its beginning. Again, the precedence is French but the execution quintessentially Bachian. The suites of the French masters generally opened with a prélude non-mesuré, the harmonies of which were indicated in a series of metrically free semibreves, without any formal rhythmic pattern. The opening movement of the first partita, a Praeludium, gives way to the short Sinfonia of the second, its heavily dotted rhythms recalling the French style. A more subtle cantabile bicinium follows, which in turn leads to a fugal two-part invention; the a minor Fantasia of the third partita yields to the D major Ouverture of the fourth, in which Bach s assimilation of a style made famous by Lully manifests itself in a slow, dotted introduction that is followed by a quick, three-part fugue. The opening of the sixth partita also displays the same discretion, where we have an Italianate toccata in which four decorated and arpeggiated chords give way to a Corrente-like figure that is finally capped with a three-part fugue.

A similar variety is also found in the other movements. Although the Allemandes are written always as a serene movement in duple time, they demonstrate differentiated rhythmic and metrical structures: despite their conformity to a standard binary structure, no two Allemandes are alike. Each contains a subtle variety through its changing rhythmic and contrapuntal structure, and, in a departure from standard practice, Bach also varies their length and affekt. Since its original inception was as a piece for the keyboard (in contrast to the other movements of the standard suite), the structure of the Allemande is afforded a much larger freedom of movement. Comment has already occurred concerning the Italian nature of some of the Courantes. In fact, only two of the partitas (c minor and D major) contain movements that conform to the French practices of alternating metres between 3/2 and 6/4, their style chosen to suit the French pretensions of their opening movements. The remainder incline towards the Corrente, a more rapid movement in 3/8 or 3/4, especially in partitas 1 and 5 (B-flat and G major), where they reflect the distinctly Italianate nature of their introductions. Those of the a and e minor partitas suggest mixed forms, the first an interplay between dotted rhythms and invention-like bicinium counterpoint, the second a play on syncopations in quavers. A similar discretion to that used in the Allemandes is also to be found in the Sarabandes. Finally, the Gigues, distinctly diverse in metre from one partita to the next, employ the time signatures of C, 12/8, 9/16, 6/8 and 4/2. The last is unusual, since Bach used an old-fashioned metrical designation that was once reserved for triple time: a split circle. The Gigue in the first partita, distinctly modelled on the Italian Giga, is non-polyphonic in nature and consists of flowing triplets that outline the movement s harmonic progressions: four are treated fugally, with that of partita 5 (G major) becoming a complex double-fugue in its second section. The D major Gigue (partita 4) is much simpler, but in the second half, its counterpoint juxtaposes with the opening theme. In the remainder of the Gigues, the theme of the second section mirrors the first, although in the e minor one, rather than being in the dominant, it is retained, inverted, and in the tonic.

The remaining movements are not standardised. The Minuets follow discrete stylistic conventions: those of the B-flat major are distinctly Italian in texture; the D major is French whilst the G major has little in common with its designation, Tempo di menuetto, since its rhythmic structure alternates freely between 3/4 and 6/8. The other dance-movements included are the more conforming Passepied and Tempo di gavotta, as well as movements of a more virtuose nature, the Burlesca, Scherzo, Rondeau and Cappriccio.

On another level, the partitas provide stimulus on an intellectual level through their proportions and design, in which Bach cleverly employs numerology: the first two movements of the B-flat major partita have 21 and 38 bars, the ciphered numbers of B-A-C-H, where B (the German label for B-flat) = 2, A = 1, C = 3, H (B-natural) = 8. Another important number (one which appears constantly in the cantatas), is 14, the sum of the four letters of his name. Thus, the Sarabande of the first partita contains 28 bars (2 x 14) and the important cadence in the Sinfonia of Partita 2, also lies at bar 28. The D major Ouverture contains 112 bars (8 x 14) and the G major Praeambulum, in which the important fermata occurs at bar 86 (8 + 6 + 14), has 95 bars (9 + 5 = 14). Other numerological references are as follows: Rondeau in c = 112 bars; Courante in a = 56 bars; Sarabande in e = 28; Allemande in D = 28; Minuet in D = 28; Allemande in G = 28. Multiplications also occur since the product of BACH is 48 and corresponds to the Gigue in B-flat and the Passepied in G (48), the Capriccio in c and the Gigue in D (96).

In the fictional fantasy-world of J. R. R. Tolkien, the War of the Ring is was fought between Sauron and the free peoples of Middle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the continent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the Quest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching events of The Lord of the Rings.


The war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained strength since the end of the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During the War of the Ring, many thousands of Men of Rohan and Gondor were killed. The overall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over a million tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples and hundreds of thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the decline of the Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the West, the restoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of the Fourth Age.

Battles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood, at the Lonely Mountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against Sauron's forces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who fought battles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep.

The war ended after the Battle of Bywater and, shortly afterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards the end of the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and forgave the Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal of cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves.

Events.
Southern Theatre.
The objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of the nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would need to take the capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas Tirith. To this end, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south in and around Gondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer.  To keep Gondor's ally Rohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron promoted the rise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan.  Thus all of Rohan's forces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the Isengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's defence.  Meanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to attack Gondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent only a fraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern Gondor, while the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair assault.  However, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and a united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.

Rohan.

Although there had never really been peace, the War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the Fords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered his forces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the enemy. On 23 February T.A. 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the orcs marching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard however, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an island in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed. Grimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if Elfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the first battle of the Fords of Isen ended in defeat for the Rohirrim.

Now that the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command of the Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However, they were unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were surrounded. Though they successfully broke through the enemy's lines, they ended up scattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear passage into Rohan.

Meanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to gather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to the stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived unmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops. The situation became desperate, and at dawn the Rohirrim attempted a break-out. Unexpectedly, Gandalf arrived with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along with a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard. The orcs were trapped and utterly destroyed.

Days before, at an Entmoot in Fangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the destruction Saruman had wrought upon the forest, decided to march on Isengard. They were to move up to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March the destruction was completed, and the command of Isengard was taken by the Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's request he sent a large herd of Huorns to the Battle of Hornburg, to aid the Rohirrim.


Gondor.

For over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor held back the shadow and the threat from the East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron prepared to swoop in for the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had divided his forces to many fronts. The two most important of these were in the island citadel of Cair Andros and the ruined city of Osgiliath. In a strict sense, the War of the Ring began with the Great Signal from Minas Morgul and the answering signal from Mount Doom, and thus the attack on Osgiliath was the first battle of the war proper. Sauron's two armies obliterated the fortresses, and Faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts, the last defence against the Morgul forces. Soon these too were destroyed, and only Minas Tirith remained. The attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and confusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all destroyed. The Gate of Minas Tirith was broken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered, the first and only enemy to do so. All seemed lost   until six thousand Rohirrim, under King Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved the Gondorian defenders. Still, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force out of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then successfully defeated their enemies.


The Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle against Sauron in the War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the West, roughly 6,000 strong, led by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced a vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through Mordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly impossible odds the Army of the West was eventually victorious, when the Ring was destroyed, and Sauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay.

Northern Theatre.
Mordor's war effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using his outstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the Free Peoples through the north, using Orcs and allied barbarian nations of Men.  In this northern theatre of the war (which had spread far across Middle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his primary base of operations in the areas, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, to defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking Rivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.  However, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of Thranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien and the one on the Woodland Realm.  Sauron wanted to use his barbarian Easterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the Woodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the other ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it.  However, unfortunately for Sauron a strong Dwarf nation now existed at the Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the Dwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale.  Mordor's Easterling allies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale, and never linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm, which in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the line held.

Bridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war was the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and Gondor, running along the Rohan border.  Orc armies peeling off from the assault on Lothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost its entire army had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of Fangorn forest counterattacked and drove the Orcs back in a panic, and most if not all drowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.

Dale.

As the war begun, the Dwarves of Erebor refused to co-operate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. Therefore, Sauron sent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of the Dwarves and the Men of Dale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun and sought refuge in Erebor. King Brand of Dale fell before the gate of Erebor, and King under the Mountain Dáin II Ironfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body. Many Men and Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however, and were able to withstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread about the victory in the South, the Easterlings scattered and the sons of Brand and Dain let their army out of Erebor.

Lothlórien and Mirkwood.
On March 11 Lothlórien is first attacked from Dol Guldur. It was attacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord had fallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lórien, and crossed the Anduin. Dol Guldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel. 

Thranduil of Mirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur, but in this, the Battle under the Trees, the Elven folk won a hard victory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur, Celeborn met Thranduil on 6 April, and as the shadow had passed, they divided Mirkwood and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen.

Shire.

After the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman was released by Treebeard. He travelled to the Shire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the name Sharkey. Under his command ruffians entered The Shire and ruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took (Merry and Pippin) in the Battle of Bywater on 3 November. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and Wormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue however killed Saruman, before he himself was killed by the Hobbits. With the death of Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended.

Consequences.
The War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of the northwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the restoration of the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom, under King Elessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was succeeded by his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the title Prince of Ithilien.

In Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his nephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony was established, and Isengard was given to the Ents.

In Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, who were succeeded by their sons Bard and Thorin III Stonehelm. They sent their emissaries to the crowning of Elessar, and were in alliance with Gondor until their Kingdoms ended.

For the Elves, the final decline had begun. The bearers of the Rings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. In Eryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they had peace. There was also an Elven colony in Ithilien.

In the Shire life continued as it had prior to the war. It was declared a free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and Men were forbidden to enter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by King Elessar in 1452 S.R.

Once the Fourth Age began the Elves stopped having an active influence on the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since the Third. The Orcs never became a serious threat again, reduced to small bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance.

Adaptations.
There are several games that are named after the novel: the Games Workshop 2005 Summer Online Campaign, for The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game; a board game published by Fantasy Flight Games called War of the Ring (board game); a board and counter wargame called War of the Rings published by SPI in 1977 (which shows irrefutably strong influence over the Fantasy Flight version);  a real-time strategy computer game published by Sierra Entertainment in 2003; and a board and miniature wargame published by Nexus Editrice in 2004.

Trivia.
The War of the Ring is the title of the eighth volume of The History of Middle-earth.
The War of the Ring was the title J. R. R. Tolkien wanted for the third volume of The Lord of the Rings.

<doc id="6544867" title="Infinite skew polyhedron" nonfiltered="467" processed="462" dbindex="1480470">
In geometry, infinite skew polyhedra are an extended definition of polyhedra, created by regular polygon faces, and nonplanar vertex figures.

Many are directly related to a convex uniform honeycomb, being the polygonal surface of a honeycomb with some of the cells removed. As solids they are called partial honeycombs and also sponges.

These polyhedra have also been called hyperbolic tessellations because they can be seen as related to hyperbolic space tessellations which also have negative angle defects.

 Regular skew polyhedra .
According to Coxeter, in 1926 John Flinders Petrie generalized the concept of regular skew polygons (nonplanar polygons) to regular skew polyhedra.

There are 3 regular skew polyhedra:
 : 6 squares on a vertex (related to cubic honeycomb, constructed by cubic cells, removing two opposite faces from each, and linking sets of six together around a faceless cube.);
 : 4 hexagons on a vertex (related to bitruncated cubic honeycomb, constructed by truncated octahedron with their square faces removed and linking hole pairs of holes together.);
 : 6 hexagons on a vertex (related to quarter cubic honeycomb, constructed by truncated tetrahedron cells, removing triangle faces, and linking sets of four around a faceless tetrahedron.);

Their vertex figures are skew polygons, zig-zagging between two planes.

Here are some partial representations, vertical projected views of their skew vertex figures, and partial corresponding uniform honeycombs.


 Prismatic regular skew polyhedra .

There are also two regular prismatic forms, disqualified by Coxeter (among others) from being called regular because they have adjacent coplanar faces.

 5 squares on a vertex (Two parallel square tilings connected by cubic holes.);
 8 triangles on a vertex (Two parallel triangle tilings connected by octahedral holes.);

Beyond Euclidean 3-space, C. W. L. Garner determined a set of 32 regular skew polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space, derived from the 4 regular hyperbolic honeycombs.

 Semiregular skew polyhedra .

There are many other semiregular (vertex-uniform) skew polyhedra, discovered by A.F. Wells and J.R. Gott (he called them pseudopolyhedra) in the 1960's.

<doc id="5544421" title="Blitzkrieg II (computer game)" nonfiltered="470" processed="465" dbindex="1480473">


Blitzkrieg II is a real-time tactics computer game based on the events of World War II, the game is an evolution of its predecessor Blitzkrieg. The game takes place in Africa, Russia, the Pacific and Europe, and features the different sides that fought there during the war.

Features and factions.
As its predecessor and the similar Sudden Strike games, Blitzkrieg II focuses on the battles of World War II rather than real-time strategy aspects like base building and resource extraction. The game features many new features and units over its predecessor; the graphics engine is upgraded, allowing for full 3D and the game features over 250 units compared to Blitzkriegs 200. 

The game contains five sides:
Germany;
Soviet Union;
Great Britain;
Japan;
USA;
Japan was newly added for Blitzkrieg II for the new Pacific theatre. The game also includes an encyclopedia of all units, so you can easily read about the units you get to see ingame. There is an online version of this at the Blitzkrieg II website.

Critical reaction.
The game was not well received, as the game took away heavily from the original RTS genre, and gave itself to more of an arcade one. Many players of the original Blitzkrieg decided to stay with it because they preferred the realism of Blitzkrieg which Blitkrieg II had thrown away. Another reason was because several models from the original game were just re-cycled and used in the game. The Russian rail artillery is one of these, as it has no real use ingame. Blitzkrieg II did not reach the success that Blitzkrieg had reached. However, an expansion pack is set to release in 2007, entitled Blitzkrieg II: Fall Of The Reich.

<doc id="393535" title="Coolidge effect" nonfiltered="474" processed="469" dbindex="1480477">
In biology and psychology, the term Coolidge effect describes phenomonena seen in many species whereby males show continuously high sexual performance given the introduction of new receptive females (e.g. Brown, 1974 ).  The sex difference that the effect refers to is explained by Bateman's principle.

Origin of the term.

The term comes from an old joke according to which President Calvin Coolidge and his wife allegedly visited a government farm one day and were taken around on separate tours. Mrs. Coolidge, passing the chicken pens, inquired of a supervisor whether the lone rooster was sufficient, given the many hens in the chicken flock.

"Yes", the man said, "the rooster works very hard."

Mrs. Coolidge then asked, "Really?  The rooster works very hard?  Every day?"

"Oh, yes," the man said.  "Dozens of times a day."

"Interesting!" Mrs. Coolidge replied, "Be sure to tell that to the President!"

Some time later the President, passing the same pens, was told about the roosters   and about his wife's remark. "Same hen every time?", he asked. 

"Oh, no, a different one each time," the supervisor replied.

"Tell that," Coolidge said with a sly nod, "to Mrs. Coolidge."

Empirical evidence.
The original (Beach and Jordan, 1956) experiments with rats followed the following protocol.  A male rat would be placed into an enclosed large box with 4 or 5 female rats in estrus. He would immediately begin mating with all of the female rats repeatedly until eventually exhausted. Although the females would continue nudging and licking him to continue, his paws were pointed skyward and he wouldn't respond. However, if a novel female were introduced to the box he would become alert, response, and find, within his little rat heart, the ability to mate once again with the new female.  This phenomenon, which has been termed the Coolidge Effect, is not limited to Rattus norvegicus (Wilson, Khuen, Beach, 1963).

While the Coolidge effect is usually seen demonstrated by males (a male that is incapable of continuing sex with a familiar partner can have sex with an unfamiliar partner), Lester & Gorzalka came up with a model to see if the Coolidge effect occurs in females also. They found that it does, although it appears to be less well-known. (Source: Biopsychology by John Pinel, 6th edition)

Some researchers think that exposure to the pheromones of a new female is a significant factor in this phenomenon.

The Coolidge effect has sometimes been mentioned as an explanation of why pornographic images are exciting to the male when first purchased, but after repeated viewing can "lose its effect."   The phenomenon may also explain why male pornographic actors may use the services of a fluffer.

<doc id="795239" title="Luigi Carlo Farini" nonfiltered="475" processed="470" dbindex="1480478">

Luigi Carlo Farini (October 22, 1812   August 1, 1866) was an Italian statesman and historian.

Biography.
Farini was born at Russi, near Ravenna. After completing a brilliant university course at Bologna, which he interrupted to take part in the revolution of 1831, he practised as a physician at Russi and at Ravenna. He acquired a considerable reputation, but in 1843 his political opinions brought him under the suspicion of the police and caused his expulsion from the papal states. He resided successively in Florence and Paris, and travelled about Europe as private physician to Prince Jerome Bonaparte, but when Pius IX was elected to the Holy See and began his reign with apparently Liberal and nationalist tendencies, Farini returned to Italy and was appointed secretary-general to G Recchi, the minister of the interior (March 1848).

But he held office for little more than a month, since like all the other Italian Liberals he disapproved of the popes change of front in refusing to allow his troops to fight against Austria, and resigned with the rest of the ministry on April 29. Pius, wishing to counteract the effect of this policy, sent Farini to Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, to hand over the command of the papal contingent to him. Elected member of parliament for Faenza, he was again appointed secretary to the ministry of the interior in the Mamiani cabinet, and later director-general of the public health department.

He resigned office on the proclamation of the republic after the flight of the pope to Gaeta in 1849, resumed it for a while when Pius returned to Rome with the protection of French arms, but when a reactionary and priestly policy was instituted, he went into exile and took up his residence at Turin. There he became convinced that it was only through the House of Savoy that Italy could be liberated, and he expounded his views in Cavour's paper Il Risorgimento, in La Frusta and Il Piemonte, of which latter he was at one time editor. He also wrote his chief historical work, Lo Stato Romano dal 1815 al 1850, in four volumes (Turin, 1850).

In 1851 he was appointed minister of public instruction in the D'Azeglio cabinet, an office which he held till May 1852. As a member of the Sardinian parliament and as a journalist Farini was one of the staunchest supporters of Cavour, and strongly favoured the proposal that Piedmont should participate in the Crimean War, if indeed he was not actually the first to suggest that policy (see GB Ercolani's letter in E Parri's memoir of Farini). In 1856 and 1857 he published two letters to Mr Gladstone on Italian affairs, which created a sensation, while he continued to propagate his views in the Italian press.

When on the outbreak of the war of 1859 Francis V, duke of Modena, was expelled and a provisional government set up, Farini was sent as Piedmontese commissioner to that city; but although recalled after the peace of Villafranca he was determined on the annexation of central Italy to Piedmont and remained behind, becoming a Modenese citizen and dictator of the state. He negotiated an alliance with Parma, Romagna and Tuscany, when other provisional governments had been established, and entrusted the task of organizing an army for this central Italian league to General Fanti.

Annexation to Piedmont having been voted by plebiscite and the opposition of Napoleon III having been overcome, Farini returned to Turin, when the king conferred on him the order of the Annunziata and Cavour appointed him minister of the interior (June 1860), and subsequently viceroy of Naples; but he soon resigned on the score of ill-health. Cavour died in 1861, and the following year, Farini succeeded Rattazzi as premier, in which office he endeavoured to carry out Cavour's policy. Over-exertion, however, brought on softening of the brain, which compelled him to resign office on March 24, 1863, and ultimately resulted in his death. He was buried at Turin, but in 1878 his remains were removed to his native village of Russi.

His son Domenico Farini had a distinguished political career and was at one time president of the chamber.

Bibliography.

Several letters from Farini to Mr Gladstone and Lord John Russell were reprinted in a Mémoire sur les affaires d'Italie (1859), and a collection of his political correspondence was published tinder the title of Lettres sur les affaires d'Italie (Paris, 1860). His historical work was translated into English in part by Mr Gladstone and in part under his superintendence. See E Parri, Luigi Carlo Farini (Rome, 1878); L Carpi in Il Risorgimento Italiano, vol. iv. (Milan, 1888); and G Finali's article, Il 27 Aprile 1859, in the Nuova Antobogia for May 16, 1903.

Species richness is the simplest measure of biodiversity and is simply a count of the number of different species in a given area. It is referred to in equations as .

In order to account for the probability of missing some of the actual total number of species present in any count based on a sample population, the Jackknife estimate may be employed:

S=n+((n-1)/n)k  where 
 S=species richness;
 n=total number of species present in sample population;
 k=number of "unique" species (of which only one organism was found in sample population);

Similarly the equation may also be noted as:

S = E + k(n-1)/n where
 E = the summation of number of species in each sample;
 k = number of rare/unique species;
 n = number of sample;

As well, when looking at local diversity the appropriate formula to use is:

S = cAz   where

 c = a specific number for each taxa ;
 A = the area of study;
 z = the slope perimeter;

Reasons of being Commonly used.
Practical Application.
It is proven that species richness is measurable in practice. It is one of the two components of the ecosystem's species diversity. 

Existing Information.
A huge amount of information of pattern of species richness exists. This information can be found in academic literature. Further information on Species richness can be extracted from different kinds of database, such as museums.  

Surrogary.
Species richness has been found to be a good surrogate for other measures of biodiversity that would be more difficult to be measured directly as species richness is positively correlated with some measures.

Wide application.
'Species richness' has been widely applied in practical management, legislation, and political discourse.   

Factors affect Species Richness.
There is a strong inverse correlation in many groups between species richness and latitude - the farther from the equator, the fewer species can be found, even when compensating for the reduced surface area of the globe in higher latitudes. Equally, as altitude increases, species richness decreases, indicating an effect of area, available energy, isolation and/or zonation (intermediate elevations can receive species from higher and lower).

Latitude.
Latitudinal Gradient.
See also: Rapoport's rule and Latitudinal gradients in species diversity
 The species richness increase from high latitudes to the low latitudes. ;
 The peak of the species richness is not at Equator, however. It is deducted that the peak is between 20-30°N.
 The gradient of species richness is asymmetrical about the equator. The level of species richness increase rapidly from the north region but decrease slowly from the equator to southern region.

Area effect.
The latitudinal gradients of the species richness may result from the effect of area. The area at lower latitudes is larger than that at higher latitudes, leading to higher species richness at lower latitudes.

Productivity.
The latitudinal gradients of species richness may be result from the energy available to the ecosystems. At lower latitudes, there are higher amounts of energy available because of more solar radiation, more resources (for example, minerals and water); as a result, higher levels of species richness can be allowed at lower latitudes.

Area.
The relationship between species richness and area is commonly approximated as following equation:  or  
where S is the number of species (reflect the species richness), A is the Area, and z and c are constants.

The above relation explains the variation of species richness among different areas.

Sampling.
Species Richness may not really relate to the area size but the statistical artefact. More species can be recorded may just because more samples are collected in larger area.

Habitat diversity.
It is possible that larger area contain more habitats as it is said that larger area is more topographically and environmentally diverse. Therefore, there are more opportunities for more species to set up their populations due to higher habitat diversity.

Relationship between Endemism and Species Richness.
The levels of endemism and that of species richness are frequently positive correlated; however, in some oceanic islands, there is high levels of endemism but the levels of species richness are quite low.

Other Methods for measuring Biodiversity.
Other measures of biodiversity may also take into account the rarity of the taxa, and the amount of evolutionary novelty they embody. 

Weakness.
As a measure of biodiversity, species richness suffers from the lack of a good definition of "species." There are at least 7 definitions, with their own strength and weakness. Still, it is easy to measure, and is well studied.

Species richness fails to take into consideration species evenness.  Other measures of biodiversity, such as the Simpson index, the Shannon-Wiener index, and the fundamental biodiversity parameter  of the unified neutral theory of biodiversity take species evenness into consideration.

<doc id="2161035" title="Leodegar" nonfiltered="480" processed="475" dbindex="1480483">


Saint Leodegar or Leger, Bishop of Autun (ca 615   Sarcing, Somme October 2,  679), was the great opponent of Ebroin  the mayor of the Palace of Neustria  and the leader of the faction of Austrasian great nobles in the struggles for hegemony over the waning Merovingian dynasty. His torture and death made him a martyr and saint of the Roman Catholic Church, which embraced the cause of the Austrasian mayors of the palace, the Arnulfings, in the following century, anointed as the Carolingian dynasty.
 
Leodegar, son of Bobilo (and Sigrada, later a nun at Soissons) was of high rank among the Frankish nobility. His brother was the comes Gaerinus (Warin), according to the Liber Historiae Francorum. Leodegar, as befitted his rank, was raised in Paris at the court of Clotaire II, king of all the Franks, and educated at the palace school. At about the age of twenty he went to Poitiers, where there was a long-established cathedral school, to study under the guidance of his uncle Desiderius (Dido), the bishop, who ordained him archdeacon and associated him in the government of the diocese. In or about 650, after he became a priest, and with the bishop's recommendation, Leodegar was made abbot of the monastery of St Maxentius, (Saint-Maixent) in Poitou. At the abbey he introduced the Benedictine rule, one of his Vitae relates.  

In 656, about the time of the usurpation of Grimoald in Austrasia and the banishment of the boy-heir, Dagobert II, Leodegar was called to the Neustrian court by the widowed Queen Bathilde to assist in the government of the united kingdoms and in the education of her children. Then in 659 he was named to the see of Autun, in Burgundy. He again undertook the work of reform and held a council at Autun in 661 to denounce Manichaeism and was the first to adopt the stringently Trinitarian Athanasian Creed. He made reforms among the secular clergy and in the religious communities, and had three baptisteries erected in the city. The church of Saint-Nazaire was enlarged and embellished, and a refuge established for the indigent. Leodegar also caused the public buildings to be repaired and the old Roman walls of Autun to be restored. His authority at Autun placed him as a leader among the Franco-Burgundian nobles.

Meanwhile, in 660 the Austrasian nobles demanded a king, and young Childeric II was sent to them through the influence of Ebroin, the mayor of the palace in Neustria. The queen withdrew from the court that was Ebroin's in all but name, to an abbey she had founded at Chelles, near Paris. On the death of Clotaire III in 673, a dynastic struggle ensued, with rival claimants as pawns; Ebroin raised Theoderic to the throne, but Leodegar and the other bishops supported the claims of his elder brother Childeric II, who, by the help of the Austrasians and Burgundians, was eventually made king. Ebroin was interned at Luxeuil  and Theoderic sent to St. Denis. 

Leodegar remained at court, guiding the young king. In 673 or 675, however, Leodegar was also sent to Luxeuil. The cause, a protest against the marriage of Childeric and his first cousin, is a hagiographic convention ; as a leader of the Austrasian and Burgundian nobles, Leodegar was easily represented as a danger by his enemies. When Childeric II was murdered at Bondi in 673, by a disaffected Frank, Theoderic III was installed as king in Neustria, making Leudesius his mayor. Leodegar and Ebroin each took advantage of the chaos to make his escape from Luxeuil and hasten to the court. In a short time Ebroin caused Leudesius to be murdered and became mayor once again, still Leudegar's implacable enemy.  

About 675 the Duke of Champagne and the Bishops of Chalons and Valence stirred up by Ebroin, attacked Autun, and Leodegar fell into their hands. At Ebroin's instigation, his eyes were gouged out and the sockets cauterized, and his tongue was cut out.  Some years later Ebroin persuaded the king that Childeric had been assassinated at the instigation of Leodegar. The bishop was seized again, and, after a mock trial, was degraded and condemned to further exile, at Fécamp, in Normandy. Near Sarcing he was led out into a forest by Ebroin's order and murdered. 

A dubious  testament drawn up at the time of the council of Autun has been preserved as well as the Acts of the council. A letter which he caused to be sent to his mother after his mutilation is likewise extant.

In 782, his relics were translated from the site of his death Sarcing in Artois to the site of his earliest hagiography - the Abbey of St Maxentius (Saint-Maixent) near Poitiers. Later they were removed to Rennes and thence to Ebreuil, which place took the name of Saint-Léger in his honour. Some relics are still kept in the cathedral of Autun and the Grand Séminaire of Soissons. In 1458 Cardinal Rolin caused his feast day to be observed as a holiday of obligation.

For sources to his biography, there are two early, though not contemporaneous Lives, drawn from the same lost source (Krusch 1891).

Frederick William Fairholt (1814 April 3, 1866) was an English antiquary and wood engraver.

He was born in London.  His father, who was of a German family (the name was originally Fahrholz), was a tobacco manufacturer, and Frederick was at first employed in the business. He then worked as a drawing-master, and later as a scene-painter.  Ink copies made by him of figures from William Hogarth's plates led to his being employed by Charles Knight on several of his illustrated publications.

His first published literary work was a contribution to Hone's Year-Book in 1831. His life was one of almost uninterrupted quiet labour, carried on until within a few days of death. Several works on civic pageantry and some collections of ancient unpublished songs and dialogues were edited by him for the Percy Society in 1842. In 1844 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He published an edition of the dramatic works of John Lyly in 1856.

His principal works are Tobacco, its History and Association (1859); Gog and Magog (1860); Up the Nile and Home Again (1862); many articles and serials contributed to the Art Journal, some of which were afterwards separately published, as Costume in England (1846); Dictionary of Terms in Art (1854). These works are illustrated by numerous cuts, drawn on the wood by his own hand.  He also illustrated Evans's Coins of the Ancient Britons, Frederick William Madden's Jewish Coinage, Halliwell's folio Shakespeare and his Sir John Maundeville, Charles Roach Smith's Richborough, the Miscellanea Graphica of Lord Londesborough, and many other works.

His books relating to Shakespeare were bequeathed to the library at Stratford-on-Avon; those on civic pageantry (between 200 and 300 volumes) to the Society of Antiquaries; his old prints and works on costume to the British Museum; his general library he desired to be sold and the proceeds devoted to the Literary Fund.

Pocket Listing.
A pocket listing is a real estate industry term used in USA that denotes an available property not in a multiple listing system (MLS).  When a broker is hired to sell a property, a listing agreement is executed in writing.  The agreement for a pocket listing states that the property will not or shall not (legal term) be placed in an MLS.  The reasons for a pocket listing vary from privacy/secrecy to descrimination.  Some sellers want to keep their sale quiet for reasons only they know.  Some sellers want to only sell to "x" type of person.  Most full time agents have knowledge of pocket listings in their own office or in other offices.  Most MLSs try to prohibit this type of listing by requiring execution of a written notice relative to the benefits of MLS publicity, and/or by encouraging members to refrain from pocket listings.  There are some companies who list property as pocket listings for a short time before entering it in their MLS.  This allows the company to try to get both the sell commission and the buy commission, called "both sides of the transaction" in the industry.  A real estate company that is not a member of any MLS only has pocket listings.  Such a company may still willingly cooperate with other real estate professionals in the sale of their listings.

Pocket listings are not "open listings".  An open listing is a property avalble for sale without exclusion as to which real estate professional can advertise, show, or negotiate the sale.  Some real estate companies require a written agreement for an open listing.  For sale by owners (FSBOs) can often also be open listings, but will usually not be pocket listings.

The "Citie of Henricus" , also known as Henricopolis or Henrico Town, was a city founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1611 as an alternative to the swampy and dangerous area around Jamestown Settlement, Virginia. It was named for Prince Henry, the eldest son of King James I.

Henricus was the second successful English city in the New World and was located on the James River, just a few miles southeast of the modern city of Richmond, Virginia, but at the time, one of the westernmost outlying developments from the Colony's fortified capital at Jamestown.

This city is near where Pocahontas grew up among the Appomattox tribe, where she converted to Christianity, and where she and John Rolfe fell in love, and married in 1614, living together across the river at the Varina Farms Plantation. There, a son, Thomas Rolfe, was born to the couple.  

The early 17th century settlers in the young colony tried to start what would have been the first institution of higher education in the British colonies. In 1618 a royal charter was obtained for founding the University of Henrico, and in the following years land was set aside for its use. But nothing more than a school for the Native Americans had actually come into existence by 1622, when the town was destroyed in the Indian Massacre of 1622. It was not rebuilt, and Virginia had to wait until 1693 for the College of William and Mary to be established. Many historians believe that the successful plan submitted to the Crown for William and Mary was based largely upon the earlier efforts at Henricus. 

The site of Henricus later became part of the Shire of Henrico (1634), later renamed Henrico County (1637). It was included in the area south of the James River subdivided to form Chesterfield County in 1749. 

Over time, even the exact location was lost. However, in the late 20th century, the site was rediscovered and has been partially restored. Henricus Historical Park is located within the 810-acre Dutch Gap Conservation Area, portions of which were the site of major Revolutionary and Civil War action.

Gorgonops (Gorgon (the mythological creature) and -ops, from Greek meaning 'face') is the name given to an extinct genus of synapsid which lived about 260 million years ago, during the late Permian Period. It was a typical representative of the Gorgonopsia, the dominant predators of their day, which in the largest forms grew to over 4 meters long and had evolved canine teeth, as well as other traits associated with its mammalian descendants. Arguments have even been made for synapsids of its time being warm-blooded, though no strong evidence exists either way.

Gorgonops itself was a medium to large-sized representative of the group, with a skull length of 20 to 35 cm, depending on the species.

The holotype of the type species, Gorgonops torvus, was in 1876 one of the first therapsids described, by Richard Owen, who also coined the name "Dinosauria" on the basis of the first known dinosaur fossils.  It was also used as the type for which Richard Lydekker described the family in 1890.  Five years later, in 1895,  Harry Govier Seeley used this genus to establish the group as a whole.  In later years, a large number of further species and genera were designated, but some of these turned out to be synonyms.

In Popular Culture.
It featured in Episode 3 of Walking with Monsters as the top predator, preying on Scutosaurus.

Species.
The following list of species follows the list of species provided Sigogneau-Russell, 1989.  The type species is listed first, then the others in alphabetical order.

Since the above work was written, the dating of the Karoo Basin (Beaufort Group) has been revised.  According to Smith and Keyser 1995, Gorgonops is known from the Tropidostoma and most of the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zones, and this has been taken into account when compiling the following list. 

Gorgonops torvus OWEN, 1876 
The type species.  The holotype is an incomplete and flattened skull found at Mildenhalls, Fort Beaufort, South Africa.  A number of other specimens have been found since, all from the Tropidostoma and/or Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone(s).  This was a medium-sized animal, with a skull about 20 cm in length.  It is distinguished from other species by a longer snout, and other details of the bones of the skull.  Originally considered primitive, it is actually (according to Sigogneau-Russell) a rather specialised member of the group.  

Gorgonops longifrons (HAUGHTON 1915)  A large specimen known from an incomplete and flattened skull about 35 cm long.  Orbit larger and snout longer than G. whaitsi, from which it may have descended.  Beaufort West, Tropidostoma/Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone.
Synonyms: Gorgonognathus longifrons HAUGHTON 1915

Gorgonops whaitsi (BROOM, 1912)
Larger than G. torvus, with the rear of the skull wider, and other details of proportion.  Originally the type species of Scymnognathus.   Despite being known from a large number of specimens from the Karoo Basin, Beaufort West (Tropidostoma/Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone), the species remains poorly known. Watson and Romer placed Gorgonops and Scymnognathus in two different families, while Sigogneau-Russell 1989 placed the two species in the same genus, and considers G. whaitsi a more primitive (less derived) form.  
Synonyms: Scymnognathus whaitsi BROOM, 1912

The following are more problematic species (either synonyms or uncertain placement):

Gorgonops? dixeyi (HAUGHTON, 1926) 
A large, incomplete and flattened skull, from Chiweta Beds, Nyassaland.  Genetic placement uncertain.  Probably Low Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone equivalent (= middle of the Wuchiapingian Stage).  See Jacobs et al 2005 for more on this species discussion on its age.
Synonyms: Chiwetasaurus dixeyi HAUGHTON, 1926

Gorgonops? kaiseri (BROILI & SCHROEDER, 1934).  A large  (estimated total length about 35 cm long), incomplete skull, with a high snout and narrower in the rear than other species, from the "High Tapinocephalus zone" (i.e. earlier than the other species, most probably Pristerognathus Assemblage Zone) 
Synonyms: Pachyrhinos kaiseri BROILI & SCHROEDER, 1934

Gorgonops eupachygnathus (WATSON, 1921)
A flattened, incomplete, medium-sized skull, probably a juvenile of either G. torvus or G. whaitsi 
Synonyms: Scymnosuchus whaitsi WATSON, 1921, Scymnognathus whaitsi (WATSON, 1921), Leptotrachelus eupachygnathus WATSON, 1921, Leptotracheliscops eupachygnathus (WATSON, 1921)

The three-speed bicycle is a bicycle that uses internal hub gears at the rear wheel hub to provide three gear ratios. Typically, in low gear, the rear sprocket turns faster than the wheel; in middle gear, the rear sprocket turns at the same speed as the wheel; in high gear, the rear wheel turns faster than the sprocket.

Three-speed hubs have been in use since the early 1900s. Though they are heavier than comparable derailleur systems, internal-gear hub systems generally last longer and require less maintenance. During their heyday, three-speed hubs were used in all applications, including racing and time trialling, cargo cycling, utility cycling, and commuting. In many parts of the world, three-speed hubs are still preferred for commuting and other types of utility cycling over derailleur systems.

Internal-gear hubs come in a variety of models, including three-, four-, five-, seven-, eight- and even 14-speed versions.  Notable manufacturers of internal-gear hubs include Sturmey-Archer, an early pioneer (now owned by SunRace); Rohloff; SACHS/SRAM; and Shimano.

Irresistible is the second album by American pop singer Jessica Simpson, released in 2001 (see 2001 in music).  The LP featured the hit single "Irresistible," and its poorly received follow up "A Little Bit".  Many fans were upset that Columbia Records refused Simpson a third single, as many tracks on the record were radio-friendly.  Among the contenders for single three were "Forever in Your Eyes" and the fan favorite "What's It Gonna Be." "When You Told Me You Love Me" was hoosen for the third single in the same time when "A Little Bit" was released, but due to second single flop Columbia cancelled the promotion. Several promo CDs of "When You Told Me You Love Me" with Soul Solution/Plasmic Honey remixes were released.

Sales.

The album did do well in the United States. It debuted with 127,000 copies its first week, while it spent only seven weeks in the Top 50. After seven weeks, it had sold 420,000 copies. To date, it has sold about 800,000 copies. It was certified gold in July 2001.

<doc id="666259" title="Black garden ant" nonfiltered="498" processed="493" dbindex="1480502">


The black garden ant (Lasius niger) is a formicine monogynous ant, the type species of the subgenus Lasius, found all over Europe and in some parts of North America and Asia.

Nuptial flights happen at various times in the year throughout the species' range; in North America they usually occur during the autumn, whereas in Europe they generally take place during the hot summer months of July and August. Flights can contain thousands of winged males and females. L. niger is considered a pest in most areas.

Disparities between local weather conditions can cause nuptial flights to be out of phase amongst widespread populations of L. niger. During long-lasting, hot summers, flights can take place simultaneously across the country, but overcast weather with local patches of sunshine results in a far less synchronised emergence of alates.

Lasius niger is host to a number of temporary social parasites of the Lasius mixtus group including L. mixtus and L. umbratus.


In the Garden.
This type of ant is a problem for some gardeners. They will farm aphids for the honeydew they excrete by bringing them inside the nest and bringing them back out again when necessary. The ants will also eat ripe fruits, especially fruits like strawberries that don't have a thick protective skin.

 In the Home .

Black garden ants often explore their surroundings quite extensively during early summer months in an effort to increase the food supply to their queen and her young, and also as a way of testing new ground in preparation for the nests' summer flight. In some cases, these explorations lead to a burrowing through mortar and brick. The usual response from humans when they see several ants in their house (usually the kitchen) is to panic and reach for the insecticide powder. A better method of eradicating ants from the house is to ensure that all food surfaces are clean and free from sugar and sweet substances that may tempt the ants frequently to return for food. Even in flight, the ants will soon realise that they have chosen the wrong place to start their mating flight. If left alone, the colony will nearly always choose an external wall to use as their official take off.

Guillaume-Alphonse Nantel (4 November 1852   3 June 1909) was a Canadian lawyer, journalist, author, newspaper owner, and politician.

In the 1882 federal election, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Conservative candidate in the Quebec riding of Terrebonne. He resigned less than two months later to allow Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, the Secretary of State of Canada, to run for office.

In a August 1882 by-election, he was acclaimed to the Quebec National Assembly in the riding of Terrebonne. He was re-elected in 1886 and 1890. He was acclaimed again in 1892 and re-elected in 1897. He was the commissioner of public works in the cabinets of Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville and Louis-Olivier Taillon. He was also the commissioner of crown lands in the cabinet of Edmund James Flynn. He was defeated in the 1900 elections.

His brother, Wilfrid Bruno Nantel, was also a politician.

M lavik gnimitram is a  Sanskrit play by K lid sa. It is his first play. The principal characters of M lavik gnimitram are M lavik  and Agnimitra. 

The play tells the story of the love of Agnimitra, the Shunga king of Vidisha, for the beautiful hand-maiden of his chief queen. He falls in love with the picture of an exiled servant girl named M lavik . When the queen discovers her husband's passion for this girl, she becomes infuriated and has M lavik  imprisoned, but as fate would have it, in the end she is discovered to be of royal birth and is accepted as one of his queens. 

The play contains an account of the Rajasuya sacrifice performed by Pushyamitra, and an elaborate exposition of a theory on music and acting.

William Duddell (1872-1917) was a British electro-physicist and electrical engineer. He was privately educated in the UK and France and rose quickly through the prestigious City & Guilds Schools via scholarships. His inventions include the moving coil oscillograph, as well as the thermo-ammeter and thermo-galvanometer.

Prior to Thomas Edison's invention of the incandescent bulb, electric lighting was used in street lamps all over Europe in the form of "arc lamps", which created light by means of an electrical arc between two carbon nodes. These lamps, which used energy inefficiently and gave a relatively dull light, also produced a constant audible hum. Duddell was appointed in 1899 to solve this problem. As a result of his research (through which he demonstrated the humming was caused by a fluctuating electric current), he invented in the Singing Arc Lamp, which could generate musical notes by way of a keyboard which interrupted oscillations in a circuit, making it one of the first examples of electronic music, and the very first that did not use the telephone system as an amplifier or speaker.

When Duddell exhibited the Singing Arc Lamp to the London Institution of Electrical Engineers, arc lamps on the same circuit in other buildings were noticed to play the tones of Duddell's machine. Despite the potential of music delivered over the lighting network, Duddell did not capitalize on his discovery as anything more than a novelty.

Duddell deserved recognition and was duly made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1913, four years before his early death.

Toivo Jalmari Särkkä (November 20, 1890, Mikkeli   February 9, 1975, Helsinki), born Toivo Hjalmar Silén, was a Finnish film producer and director. He was CEO of the production company Suomen Filmiteollisuus.

Before his career in filmmaking, Särkkä worked as a bank manager and chairman in Kotimainen Työ, an organization promoting Finnish work and products. After the death of Erkki Karu, founder and owner of Suomen Filmiteollisuus, Särkkä became the CEO thus producing 233 and directing 49 feature films.

In 1965, when Finnish film industry was in difficulties due to the coming of television, Särkkä initiated bankruptcy of Suomen Filmiteollisuus. Films directed by Särkkä are e.g. Suomisen perhe, Helmikuun manifesti, Kulkurin valssi and Vaivaisukon morsian.

Särkkä married Russian-Lithuanian Margariitta Beljavsky in 1914. They had one daughter.

Around the Bay in a Day is a recreational cycling event organised by Bicycle Victoria in Victoria, Australia. Cyclists register to ride a 210km course starting and ending in Melbourne around Port Phillip, either clockwise or anti-clockwise, catching the ferry between Queenscliff and Sorrento. 

In 2005 entrants were also offered less strenuous alternatives of a 100km ride from Sorrento to Docklands, or a more leisurely 50km ride to the Western suburbs and return using the West Gate Bridge in both directions.

The event was first run in 1993. In 2005 almost 11,000 people registered for the ride and raised about $300,000 for The Smith Family charity for disadvantaged children. In October 2004, over 8,600 riders took part.

<doc id="4683060" title="Aztec slavery" nonfiltered="505" processed="500" dbindex="1480509">
 
In the structure of the aztec society, Slaves or tlacotin (distinct from war captives) also constituted an important class. 

This slavery was very different from what Europeans of the same period were to establish in their colonies, although it had much in common with the slaves of classical antiquity. (Sahagún doubts the appropriateness even of the term "slavery" for this Aztec institution.) First, slavery was personal, not hereditary: a slave's children were free. A slave could have possessions and even own other slaves. Slaves could buy their liberty, and slaves could be set free if they were able to show they had been mistreated or if they had children with or were married to their masters.

Typically, upon the death of the master, slaves who had performed outstanding services were freed. The rest of the slaves were passed on as part of an inheritance.

Another rather remarkable method for a slave to recover liberty was described by Manuel Orozco y Berra in La civilización azteca (1860): if, at the tianquiztli (marketplace; the word has survived into modern-day Spanish as "tianguis"), a slave could escape the vigilance of his or her master, run outside the walls of the market and step on a piece of human excrement, he could then present his case to the judges, who would free him. He or she would then be washed, provided with new clothes (so that he or she would not be wearing clothes belonging to the master), and declared free. Because, in stark contrast to the European colonies, a person could be declared a slave if he or she attempted to prevent the escape of a slave (unless that person were a relative of the master), others would not typically help the master in preventing the slave's escape.


Orozco y Berra also reports that a master could not sell a slave without the slave's consent, unless the slave had been classified as incorrigible by an authority. (Incorrigibility could be determined on the basis of repeated laziness, attempts to run away, or general bad conduct.) Incorrigible slaves were made to wear a wooden collar, affixed by rings at the back. The collar was not merely a symbol of bad conduct: it was designed to make it harder to run away through a crowd or through narrow spaces.

When buying a collared slave, one was informed of how many times that slave had been sold. A slave who was sold four times as incorrigible could be sold to be sacrificed; those slaves commanded a premium in price.

However, if a collared slave managed to present him- or herself in the royal palace or in a temple, he or she would regain liberty.

An Aztec could become a slave as a punishment. A murderer sentenced to death could instead, upon the request of the wife of his victim, be given to her as a slave. A father could sell his son into slavery if the son was declared incorrigible by an authority. Those who did not pay their debts could also be sold as slaves.

People could sell themselves as slaves. They could stay free long enough to enjoy the price of their liberty, about twenty blankets, usually enough for a year; after that time they went to their new master. Usually this was the destiny of gamblers and of old ahuini (courtesans or prostitutes).

Motolinía reports that some captives, future victims of sacrifice, were treated as slaves with all the rights of an Aztec slave until the time of their sacrifice, but it is not clear how they were kept from running away.

The IBM 4758 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor is a secure cryptoprocessor implemented on a high-security, programmable PCI board. Specialized cryptographic electronics, microprocessor, memory, and random number generator housed within a tamper-responding environment provide a highly secure subsystem in which data processing and cryptography can be performed. 

IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations, and toolkits for custom application development:
 The PKCS #11, version 2.01 implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API. ;
 The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added. ;

As of June 2005, the 4758 is being discontinued and will be replaced by  an improved, faster model called the IBM 4764.

<doc id="5077045" title="Oscar Lovelace" nonfiltered="510" processed="505" dbindex="1480514">
Oscar Fred Lovelace (born September 23, 1959) is a physician in Prosperity, South Carolina.  He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of South Carolina. In the primary, scheduled for June 13, 2006, he sought to unseat the incumbent Republican governor, Mark Sanford. However, Sanford defeated him soundly with 65 percent of the vote.

Early years.

Lovelace was born in Columbia, South Carolina as one of three children of Virginia and Fred Lovelace; his sisters are Lynn and Karen.  In 1981 he graduated with honors from Clemson University, where he was student body president and winner of the Algernon Sidney Sullivan Award for public service and the Norris Medal for overall excellence. It was there he met Mary Atkinson, whom he married in July of 1982.  They have four children: Ben, Spencer, Erin, and Luke.

In 1985, Lovelace graduated from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.  Here, too, he was the student body president.  He selected the field of Family Medicine and completed a three-year residency at the University of Virginia.  In 1988 he moved to Prosperity and opened the Lovelace Family Medicine office in a remodeled farmhouse.

Honors and awards.

Lovelace's campaign website includes this paragraph about recognition of him and his practice:

Lovelace Family Medicine was recognized as Rural Practice of the Year in 1996 by the State Office of Rural Health. Dr. Lovelace was recognized as Wellspring Physician of the Year in 1998 by a nonprofit organization which recognizes one physician annually in the midlands of SC who practices holistic medicine - emphasizing compassionate care and sensitivity to the needs of others. Oscar was selected to be a member of nationally recognized Best Doctors in 2002 and named SC DHEC Physician of the Year in 2005 for the Midlands Health District.  Lovelace Family Medicine was named the Outstanding Teaching Practice of the Year in 2006 for the South Carolina Area Health Education Consortium because of its work educating third year medical students who are assigned two month teaching rotations from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. 

Public affairs.

In 2003, Sanford appointed Lovelace to co-chair the Governor s Health Care Task Force along with former Governor James B. Edwards.  The Task Force produced a 16-page report.

Although Lovelace had contributed money to Sanford's 2002 campaign for governor, he was disappointed by Sanford's failure to press for implementation of the Health Care Task Force's recommendations.  In challenging Sanford's bid for renomination, Lovelace also criticized "Governor Sanford s libertarian ideology and inability to work together with leaders of his own party".

<doc id="6438447" title="Modular connector" nonfiltered="512" processed="507" dbindex="1480516">



Modular connector is the name given to a family of electrical connectors examples of which are pictured.  These connectors were originally used in telephone wiring and are still prevalent for that, but are used for a variety of other things.  A modular connector's advantage over many other kinds of connectors is its small size and ease of plugging and unplugging.  Many uses that originally used a bulkier connector have migrated to modular connectors.  Probably the most well known applications of modular connectors is for telephone jacks and for Ethernet jacks, which are nearly always modular connectors.

The modular connector was first used in the Registered Jack system, so there are precise specifications of them within the Registered Jack specifications.  Those are the specifications to which all practical modular connectors are built.  However, the Registered Jack specifications don't name the physical connectors.  Instead, these are covered by ISO standard 8877, first used in ISDN systems.

Modular connectors have gender.  The male connector is called a plug, while the female connector is called a jack or sometimes a socket.

Modular connectors come in four sizes: 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-position.  A position is a place that can hold a conductor (pin).  The positions need not all be used; a connector can have any even number of conductors.  Unused positions are usually the outermost positions.  The connectors are designed so that a plug can fit into any jack that has at least the number of positions as the plug.  Where the jack has more positions than the plug, the outermost positions are unused.  However, plugs from different manufacturers may not have this compatibility, and some manufacturers of eight position jacks now explicitly warn that they are not designed to accept smaller plugs without damage.

Some connector types in the family are indexed, which means their shape is altered from the standard somewhat to prevent them from mating with standard connectors.  The indexing is usually a different shape or position of the hook, but can also be an additional tab.

The members of the family are typically identified using the format "PC", e.g. "6P2C", which means 6 positions, 2 conductors.  Alternate formats "x" (e.g. "6x2") or "/(e.g. "6/2") are also used.

Modular connectors lock together.  A spring loaded tab called a "hook" on the plug snaps into a jack so that the plug cannot be pulled out.  To remove the plug, you have to press the hook.  The most common way to install a jack in a wall or panel is with the hook side down.  This usually makes it easier to operate the hook when removing the plug, because the person grabs the plug with thumb on top and presses the hook with the index finger.  The positions of a jack are numbered left to right, looking into the receiving side of the jack with the hook side down, starting at 1.  The positions of plug are numbered the same as the jack positions with which they mate.  The number of a conductor is the same as the number of the position it's in.  So for example in a 6P2C plug, only conductors 3 and 4 exist.

The pinouts (assignment of function to each conductor) are as varied as are the applications of modular connectors.  Even within the same application, there is often little standardization.  For example, there are multiple conventions for use of 8P8C for RS-232.  As a result, when you buy a DE9 - 8P8C adapter, it usually comes without the pins installed -- you insert them according to the particular standard you're using.  The telephone pinouts are well standardized as the registered jack system.  The Ethernet pinouts are also well standardized as TIA/EIA-568-B.

The application of jack versus plug is generally based on physical installation only.  Jacks go in walls and panels, while plugs go on wires.  This is in contrast to some other connector systems where the gender is related to the function of the connector (e.g. in a power cabling system, a female connector delivers power while a male connector receives power).  Extension cables (male on one end, female on the other) are rarely seen; instead, people use male-male cables and female-female couplers.

Modular connectors also go by the names "modular phone jack/plug", "RJ connector," and "Western jack/plug."
The 8P8C modular connector type is often called RJ45, but the name "RJ45" is also used for something quite different.  The "modular connector" moniker is not terribly descriptive, but arose from its original use in a novel system of cabling designed to make telephone systems more modular.

Modular connectors were originally invented and patented by Bell Telephone Laboratories (patent filed 6 July 1973;  issued 14 January 1975), and replaced the hard-wired connections on most Western Electric telephones around 1976.  At the same time, they began to replace screw terminals and large 3 and 4 pin jacks in buildings.

A disadvantage of modular connectors is that the fragile hook on a plug easily snags and often breaks when you try to pull a cord through other cords and other obstructions.  Some higher quality cables have a flexible sleeve called a "boot" over the plug, or a special hook design, to prevent this.  Boots are seen mainly on 8P8C data cables.

<doc id="9165263" title="Monkey Ninjas in Space (Kim Possible)" nonfiltered="513" processed="508" dbindex="1480517">


Monkey Ninjas in Space is the 19th episode (14th produced) of the TV series Kim Possible. It marks the second appearance of the villain Lord Montgomery Fiske, better known as Monkey Fist.

Plot Sypnosis.


Things get of to a mystical start for Lord Monkey Fist, as he and his legion of monkey ninja awaken an ancient banana talisman and are instructed by the mystique monkey monk to seek out the most intelligent monkey on Earth, and to follow him to the stars, so that the ultimate monkey master - AKA Lord Monkey Fist - may become unstoppable.

Things, however, aren't going quite so well for Kim, who is anticipating a day of embarrassment as her after her father sets his heart on her attending the an open house for children at the space center where he works. She thinks that she's too old to keep going, and he is seemingly oblivious to this. As noted when he presents her with the "Rocket Booster" sweatshirt that he brought for her when she was 8 years old, and expects her to wear it to the open house.

Meanwhile, Monkey Fist searches the internet for the most intelligent monkey in the world, only to find it in the form of Frederick the space Chimp. Predictably, Frederick turns out to be a resident of the Middleton Space Center, where Kim is spending an uncomfortable morning with a farther who acts like she's still 8 years old, a group of small children who can't quite decide whether she's a teacher or a babysitter, and a best friend who's only there for the rocket shaped cookies.

Child 1: "Are you the teacher?"Kim: "No" (perturbed)Child 2: " I think she's my babysitter. Are you going to babysit us?"Kim: "No, I'm just a big girl who really has no business being here"

After watching Ron freak out upon finding out about Frederick (due to a mascot induced monkey phobia), Kim sets out to explain to her father that she is too old for the rocket boosters, only to bail at the last minute after seeing how happy he was that they had something to do together.

After searching her conscious, and listening to some bad advice from Ron, Kim decides to tell her father the truth, only to find that Monkey Fist has taken over the space center, and that he intends to blast off with Frederick to an orbiting space station from where he intends to conquer the world. A scuffle ensues and Monkey Fist and monkey Fist escapes in the center's rocket. Fortunately, Frederick manages to escape before the rocket takes off. Unfortunately, Ron doesn't. Forcing Kim to take off in an experimental shuttle designed by her father, and her father to face up to the fact that Kim isn't a little girl anymore. A dramatic ninja battle ensure on the space station (both with an without the assistance of artificial gravity). Kim triumphs over Monkey Fist and Ron, realizing that Frederick is on his side, overcomes his fear of Monkeys.

Finally, wondering what went wrong, Monkey Fist's legion of Monkey Ninjas consult the banana talisman once more, only to discover that there was a mistake in the first message. Leading them to find a new lair and a new leader (at least until season 2 that is).

Mystique Monkey Monk: "When I said that the leader of the Monkey Ninjas would be unstoppable what I should have said was that the leader would be Ron Stoppable. My bad."



Trivia.
 Although Ron's fear of monkeys has been referenced before, and is due to an encounter with Camp Wannaweep's monkey mascot, this is the first episode to actually show the mascot.

This article is about the Canadian politician. For the British abolitionist, see David Turnbull (British abolitionist).;

David Turnbull (born March 17, 1942 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England) is a politician in Ontario, Canada.  He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003, and ran unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party of Canada in the federal election of 2004.

Turnbull was educated at the Edinburgh College of Domestic Sciences, and worked as a hotel manager in Scotland, Switzerland and Germany.  Upon moving to Canada, he continued his education at the Canadian Institute of Management.  Before entering public life, he served as a manager for Xerox Canada Ltd. and as President of Turnbull Luetolf Ltd.  He also became involved in conservative citizens' groups, including the Ratepayers' Association and the Citizens for Property Tax Reform.

Turnbull was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Brad Nixon by about 3,000 votes in the North York riding of York Mills.  The election was won by the New Democratic Party, and Turnbull sat in the opposition benches for the next five years.

The Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, and Turnbull was re-elected by more than 11,000 votes over his nearest opponent.  He was appointed Government Whip in 1995, and retained this position on being named a Minister without Portfolio in Mike Harris's government on October 10, 1997.  Turnbull supported Mel Lastman's successful bid to become Mayor of Toronto in late 1997.

The Harris Tories lost a number of Toronto-area seats in the provincial election of 1999.  Although he was re-elected, Turnbull's majority in the redistributed Don Valley West riding was significantly cut, as he outpolled Liberal Paul Davidson by just over 3,000 votes.  

On June 17, 1999, Turnbull was promoted to Minister of Transportation, and on February 8, 2001, was named to the position of Solicitor General.  In the latter capacity, he was responsible for creating the province's first Sex Offender Registry.

When Ernie Eves succeeded Harris as Premier of Ontario on April 15, 2002, he named Turnbull as his Associate Minister of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation.  Turnbull held this position until the defeat of the Eves government in the 2003 provincial election.

Turnbull was among the Tory incumbents defeated in the 2003 election, falling to Liberal candidate Kathleen Wynne by over 6,000 votes.  He sought election to Canadian House of Commons for the federal Don Valley West riding the following year, but was defeated by Liberal incumbent John Godfrey.

<doc id="2294521" title="Juan Pérez de Montalbán" nonfiltered="516" processed="511" dbindex="1480520">
Juan Pérez de Montalbán (1602 - June 25, 1638), Spanish dramatist, poet and novelist, was born at Madrid.

At the age of eighteen he became a licentiate in theology, was ordained priest in 1625 and appointed notary to the Inquisition. In 1619 he began writing for the stage under the guidance of Lope de Vega, who is said to have assisted him in composing El Orfeo en lengua castellana (1624), a poem obviously intended to compete with Jáuregui's Orfeo, published earlier in the same year. The prose tales in Sucesos y prodigios de amor (1624) and Para todos (1632) were very popular.

Montalbán's father, a publisher at Madrid, issued a pirated edition of Quevedo's Buscón, which roused an angry controversy. The violence of these polemics, the strain of overwork, and the death of Lope de Vega so affected Montalbán that he became insane; he died at Madrid on the 25th of June 1638. His last work was a eulogistic biography of Lope de Vega in the Fama póstuma (1636).

His plays, published in 1635-1638, are all in the manner of that great dramatist, and were represented with much success, but, with the exception of Los Amantes de Teruel, are little more than clever improvizations. A libellous attack on Quevedo, entitled El Tribunal de la justa venganza (1635), is often ascribed to him.

Dent is a small village nestling in a narrow valley on the western slopes of the Pennines. Until 1974 it was in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Now, although it still lies within the Yorkshire Dales National Park, for local government purposes it is within Cumbria. It is about four miles (6 km)  south east of Sedbergh and about eight miles (13 km) north east of Kirkby Lonsdale.

The valley in which it lies is called Dentdale but the river is the River Dee, a tributary of the River Lune.

The Dent Brewery is an independent, microbrewery in Cowgill just above Dent.

Dent hosts the Dent Folk Festival annually on the last weekend in June. See Dent Folk Festival website

It was also the birthplace of the famous geologist, Adam Sedgwick.

Dent railway station on the Settle and Carlisle Railway is about four miles (approx. 6 km) above the village at Denthead. Nearby, the railway goes over a splendid viaduct.

David Nash Ford has suggested that the name of the village derives from Dunoting, denoting a sub-Roman kingdom in the northern Pennines ruled by Dunod Fawr.

<doc id="3604781" title="Lycodon aulicus" nonfiltered="518" processed="513" dbindex="1480522">


The Indian Wolf Snake (Lycodon aulicus) is a species of snake found in South Asia and Southeast Asia.

Description.
The colouration of this snake is variable. It is nocturnal and is inactive in the day. It feeds on lizards and frogs. They breed prior to the monsoons and lay 4-11 eggs. Females can be larger than the males. 

This snake is often confused with the Common Krait. The presence of a loreal shield can be used to distinguish it from kraits.

The following is a description of various forms from Carl Gunther's Reptiles of British India (1864).

Snout broad, much depressed, long, spatulate, with the upper lip swollen, and without canthus rostralis. Rostral shield very low, broad, slightly bent backwards on the upper surface of the snout; anterior frontals very small; posterior frontals longer than broad, much more so in adult specimens than in young ones; there is a lateral notch between the anterior and posterior frontals, in which the inner anterior angle of the loreal is received; the posterior frontals have an obtuse lateral angle corresponding to the suture between loreal and praeocular; occipitals elongate. Nostril small, directed upwards, between two nasals, the anterior of which is situated on the foremost part of the snout. Loreal single, large, nearly twice as long as broad. Praeocular single, in contact with the vertical and with the third labial; specimens in which it does not reach the vertical are very scarce. Two posloculars; supraciliary rather small. Nine upper labials, the third, fourth, and fifth of which enter the orbit. Temporals numerous, scale-like. Scales smooth, with a minute apical groove, in seventeen rows. Abdomen and tail with an angular ridge on each side. Ventrals 183-209; anal bifid, in a few specimens entire; subcaudals 57-77. Each maxillary is armed with two fangs in front, placed in a transverse line, the outer being much larger than the inner; the lateral longitudinal series of teeth commences at some distance from the fangs; they are small, from four to twelve in number, the last being considerably larger than the others; pterygoido-palatine teeth small, of equal size; 
mandible with two or three fangs on each side and wilh a series of small teeth. 

Coloration variable.
I. Continental varieties. The posterior frontals are moderately elongate-in young specimens nearly as broad as long. Each upper labial with a brown spot. this category belong also specimens from the Philippine Islands.;
 Var. a. Uniform brown above, without collar: Malayan peninsula, Bengal, Madras.
 Var. b. Uniform brown above, with a while collar: Madras.
 Var. c. Brown or greyish brown, With indistinct traces of a white network, and with a white collar, more distinct in young specimens than in old ones: Coast of Malabar, Pinang, Malayan peninsula, Gamboja, Philippine Islands, Timor.
 Var. d. Ferruginous or chestnut-brown, with white, brown-edged cross bars on the back, which are sometimes bifid on the sides, the branches of one band joining a branch of the preceding and following bands. The first band forms a collar; those on the hind part of the body gradually become indistinct. This variety is very common, and similar to, but specifically distinct from, the snake figured by Russell (i. pl. 16): we have received it from Pinang, Bengal, Nepal, Kangra (Himalayas), the Dekkan, and the Anamallay Mountains.
 II. Ceylonese varieties. The posterior frontals are much elongate, much longer than broad in every age. Upper labials while or shaded with brown.
 Var. e. Uniform brownish grey above.
 Var. f. Brown, with three or four broad, distant, white cross bands on the anterior half of the body; the anterior forms a collar, the others being broadest on the sides.
 Var. g. Brown or greyish, with pure-while or reticulated while cross bands extending downwards to the belly, where they are broadest.

 
This is one of the most common snakes of the Indian continent and of Ceylon; it does not extend northwards lo China, and becomes scarcer on the coasts of the south-eastern parts of India; it occurs in only a few of the islands-in the Philippines and in Timor; it is not certain whether the Javan form is specifically the same. It attains lo a length of more than 2 feet, the tail being one-sixth. It is one of the most formidable enemies of the skinks, which form almost its sole food, the fangs in front of its jaws being admirably adapted for piercing and making good its hold on the hard smooth scales with which those lizards are coated. It is of fierce habits and defends itself vigorously.


The following description is from Boulenger's Fauna of British India, Reptilia and Batrachia volume (1890):


Snout much depressed, with swollen lips, spatulate in the adult; eye rather small. Rostral much broader than long, just visible from above: internasals much shorter than the prefrontals; frontal usually shorter than its distance from the end of the snout or than the parietals ; loreal elongate, not entering the eye; one praeocular, usually in contact with the frontal; two postoculars; temporals small, scale-like, 2+3 or 3+3; 9 upper labials, third, fourth, and fifth entering the eye; 4 or 5 lower labials in coutact with the anterior chin-shields, which are longer than the posterior. Scales smooth, in 17 rows. Ventrals 183-209, obtusely angulate laterally; anal divided; subcaudals 57-77, in two rows. Coloration variable; uniform brown above, or with white transverse bands, or with white reticulation; upper lip uniform white, or with brown spots; lower parts uniform white.

Total length 25 inches: tail 4.

Habitat: India and Ceylon, Himalayas, Burma, Siam, Malay Peninsula, Java, Philippines, Timor.   A common snake in India.

Scalation.
The rostral touches six shields. The frontals touch the the parietals, supraoculars, prefrontals and preoculars. The supraoculars are small. The parietals are One and a half times the size of the frontal. The preoculars are entire while the postoculars and temporals are divided into two shields.There are nine pairs of supralabials with the 3rd,4th and 5th touching the eye. The ventrals are 170 to 224 in number. The anal shield is divided. The subcaudals are 56 to 80 and are divided. 

Distribution.
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India (north to Himalyas and Assam; Maharashtra), Nepal, Myanmar (= Burma), Thailand (incl.

The European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) is a multinational European project for deep ice core drilling in Antarctica.  Its main objective is to obtain full documentation of the climatic and atmospheric record archived in Antarctic ice by drilling and analyzing two ice cores and comparing these with their Greenland counterparts (GRIP and GISP). Evaluation of these records will provide information about the natural climate variability and mechanisms of rapid climatic changes during the last glacial epoch.

The ESF EPICA Programme (1996-2005) provides co-ordination for EPICA drilling activities at Dome Concordia and Kohnen Station, which are supported by the European Commission and by national contributions from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Deep drilling took place at two sites in Antarctica: Concordia Station at Dome C and Kohnen Station.

 Concordia Station at Dome C .


This site (, 3233 m above sea level, 560 km from Vostok Station) was chosen to obtain the longest undisturbed chronicle of environmental change, in order to characterise climate variability over several glacial cycles, and to study potential climate forcings and their relationship to events in other regions.  The core goes back 740,000 years and reveals 8 previous glacial cycles. Drilling was completed at this site in December 2004, reaching a drilling depth of 3270.2 m, 5 m above bedrock. Present-day annual average air temperature is -54.5°C and snow accumulation 25 mm/y. Information about the core was first published in Nature on 2004/June/10 . The core went back 720,000 years and revealed 8 previous glacial cycles.

The picture shows delta deuterium data (a proxy for temperature: more negative values indicate lower temperatures) from both EPICA and Vostok.  The upper plot, with x-axis being age (years before 1950) clearly shows the extra information in the EPICA core before the start of the Vostok record. The lower picture, plotted against depth, shows how compressed the deeper parts of the cores are: the earliest 100 kyr of the EPICA core are in the bottom 100 m of the core.

Before 400 kyr the character of the ice ages are seen to be somewhat different: interglacial warmth is distinctly less than the four most recent interglacials. The interglacial 400 kyr ago, which is believed (from arguments about the configuration of the orbital parameters of the earth) to be an approximate analogue to the current interglacial, was quite long: 28 kyr. The Nature paper argues that if this analogue is accepted, the current climate would be expected to continue like today's, in the absence of human influence (which it states is unlikely, given the predicted increases in greenhouse gas concentrations).

Further analysis of the core is hoped to extend the record back somewhat further, possibly as far as the Brunhes-Matuyama magnetic reversal, believed to be at about 780 kyr.

The core time scale is derived from the measured depth scale by a model incorporating surface snow accumulation variations, ice thinning, basal heat fluxes etc, and is empirically "tied" at 4 times by matches to the marine isotopic record.

 Kohnen Station, Dronning Maud Land .
Kohne Station is located at , 2892 m above sea level. Higher annual snowfall and sensitivity to conditions over the South Atlantic will allow the study of any links between shifts in the Atlantic Ocean circulation and the rapid climate events detected over Greenland.

An air ambulance is an aircraft used for emergency medical assistance in situations where either a traditional ambulance cannot easily or quickly reach the scene or the patient needs to be repositioned at a distance where air transportation is most practical.  Air ambulance crews are supplied with equipment that enables them to provide medical treatment to a critically injured or ill patient.  Common equipment for air ambulances includes respirators, medication, an ECG and monitoring unit, CPR equipment, and stretchers.

 Ambulance Crew and Passengers .

The medical crew of an air ambulance varies depending on country, area, service provider and by type of air ambulance, but in most schemes may consist of one or more members of ambulance crew, such as an Emergency Medical Technician or Paramedic, sometimes a flight nurse, or in some cases, a physician.  

Air ambulance pilots are required to have a great deal of experience in piloting their aircraft because the conditions of air ambulance flights are often more challenging than regular non-emergency flight services.

Depending on the equipment, crew composition, and condition of the patient, there is sometimes room for one or more passengers.  Space in most Air Ambulances is very limited, so friends and family often must follow the air ambulance by other means.

 History .

 1928 - The first air ambulance service was established in the Australian outback.  This organisation became the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
 1934 - The first civil air ambulance service in Africa is established in Morocco by Marie Marvingt.
 1946 - The first civilian air ambulance in North America was established by the Saskatchewan government in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada - this service is still in operation in 2007. ;
 1947 - Schaefer Air Service, the first air ambulance service in the United States, was founded by J. Walter Schaefer of Schaefer Ambulance Service in Los Angeles, California. Schaefer Air Service is also the first FAA-certified air ambulance service in the U.S.

 Cost .
In the United States publicly owned air ambulance service is provided by the United States Coast Guard and other agencies in certain areas, usually at no direct cost to the individual; public air ambulance transport is usually by helicopter and involves shorter distances than privately owned air ambulance jets.

In the UK the service operates in two distinct manners. In Scotland the national parliment agreed to the state funding of the service however in England and Wales the service is funded on a charitable basis via a number of local charities for each region covered. A list of these can be found here:  

 Biggest by Country .
 United States .
 STAT MEDEVAC - PA, OH, MD, and NY - Largest privately run rotary-wing air ambulance with a fleet of over 20 helicopters.
 BayFlite - FL - Largest hospital based rotary-wing air ambulance with a fleet of over 4 helicopters.

Every year an Air Ambulance Show is held in the Czech Republic.

Wiyot (also Wishosk) is an extinct Algic language, spoken by the Wiyot people of Humboldt Bay, California. The language's last native speaker, Della Prince, died in 1962. Some Wiyots are attempting a revival of the language.

Concerning the etymology of Wiyot (a.k.a. Wishosk), the following is from Campbell (1997):

"Wiyot is from wíyat, the native name for the Eel River delta, which also referred to one of the three principal groups of Wiyots (Elsasser 1978:162).

"The connection of Wiyot and Yurok in northern California (which together were formerly called Ritwan, after Dixon and Kroeber's  grouping of the two as one of their more remote Californian stocks) with Algonquian was first proposed by Sapir (1913) and was quite controversial at that time (see Michelson 1914, 1915; Sapir 1915a, 1915b; see also Chapter 2), but the relationship has subsequently been demonstrated to the satisfaction of all (see Haas 1958; Teeter 1964a; Goddard 1975, 1979, 1990). Before 1850 the Yurok lived on the lower Klamath River. The Wiyot (earlier called Wishosk) lived in the Humboldt Bay area, in the redwood belt; the last fully fluent speaker died in 1962 (Teeter 1964b).  Many scholars have commented that although Wiyot and Yurok are neighbors in northern California, they seem not to have a closer relationship with each other than either has with Algonquian...."

Brief biography.
Na'eem Jeenah is a well-known leader in the Muslim community and the anti-capitalist and anti-war movements in South Africa. He is also an academic, author, and journalist. Jeenah currently works for the Freedom of Expression Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa. He has also taught Political Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

Jeenah was born in the coastal city of Durban on the 8 August 1965. Under South Africa's Apartheid Population Registration Act he was classified "indian". He cut his political in the 1980s when, while he was still in secondary school, the country erupted into almost a decade of nationwide student protests, followed by widespread resistance in trade unions and communities - especially in the African "townships". This was the period when the liberation movement succeeded in making South Africa "ungovernable".

After school, Jeenah entered the highly-politicized University of Natal Black Section, the medical school (only for Black students) that was attached to the White University of Natal. Through his activities with the Muslim Students Association of South Africa and the Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa, he was thrust into the political limelight as these organizations became increasingly involved in the anti-Apartheid struggle. His activism, however, was mostly inspired by Islam and was prosecuted through Muslim organizations.

After spending two years at the Medical School and a year at the University of Durban-Westville, Jeenah dropped out of university to find a job and get married. He married Shamima Shaikh, who he met for the first time when the couple was arrested during a consumer boycott campaign. Shaikh became one of South Africa's most well-known Islamic feminists. She died in January 1998, leaving Jeenah with two sons.

Jeenah rose in the ranks of the Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa to become its national General Secretary and, later, its president. He was also, for a period, the editor of the Movement's mouthpiece newspaper, Al-Qalam. He steered the movement in a way that increased its political activism during the anti-Apartheid struggle. He also, along with Shaikh and others, founded the Muslim Youth Movement Gender Desk, the foremost organization of Islamic feminism in South Africa. It was also during the 1980s that Jeenah helped his organization and the Muslim community in South Africa to get involved in inter-faith activities - particularly through the South African chapter of the World Conference on Religion and Peace. Working with the latter, he was also a member of the drafting committee of a landmark document produced during South Africa's constitution-drafting period called the Declaration on Religious Rights and Responsibilities.

In 1994, on the eve of South Africa's first democratic elections, Jeenah's family joined those in South Africa who had sacrificed family members for the struggle: his brother, Mohseen Jeenah, a student leader and anti-Apartheid activist, was gunned down in the early hours of the morning of the 17th January by Apartheid police.

Jeenah and Shaikh undertook the hajj pilgrimage in 1997, while Shaikh was already suffering from the effects of breast cancer, which had affected her severely. On the couple's return the authored a book about their pilgrimage called Journey of Discovery: A South African Hajj. Soon after, they founded the Johannesburg-based Muslim community radio station called The Voice, which exposed radical and progressive Muslim voices to the Muslim community and became a flagship for women's rights, inter-religious tolerance and anti-imperialist rhetoric. It also gave a voice to refugee communities and social movements. Shaikh died just four months after the station went on air.

Jeenah's career has been a checkered one, spanning the NGO sector, academia, religious organizations and journalism. But it is as a progressive Muslim activist and an international solidarity activist that he has made his mark.

Jeenah currently holds the position of Director: Operations at the Freedom of Expression Institute. He is also the Coordinator of a progressive Johannesburg mosque, Masjidul Islam, a steering committee member of an inter-religious organization focusing on women's issues called The Other Voices, a spokesperson for South Africa's Palestine Solidarity Committee and Anti-War Coalition and is a member of the International Coordinating Network for Palestine. He is often interviewed as an expert by various media on issues related to Islam or the Muslim world, Muslims in South Africa, the Middle East, Islamic Feminisms, political Islam, freedom of expression and various other issues. An experienced journalist, he writes for a number of publications and reports for a network of radio stations in the US. He is also a monthly columnist for the South African newspaper Al-Qalam.

Jeenah has various Islamic qualifications through international courses completed at different universities in the Muslim world. He has organized and addressed numerous meetings, seminars, workshops, conferences, and training programs on various issues related to Islam, South Africa, the Middle East, youth development, journalism, information technology and various other issues   in South Africa and internationally. He has co-authored a book and has published articles and papers in journals, magazines, newsletters, newspapers and other publications. These have ranged from news pieces to analyses and opinion pieces.

In June 2005, Jeenah married Melissa Hoole. They now have a daughter.

Na'eem was named in December 2000 on the Mail & Guardian s  Hot Shit 100 List  of people  Making their mark in the new millennium  and, in 2006, he was included on that newspaper's "100 young people you must take out to lunch".

Whirlaway (April 2, 1938-April 61953) was an American champion thoroughbred racehorse.

A chestnut colt, he was sired by "Blenheim II," out of the dam "Dustwhirl" at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.

Trained by Ben A. Jones and ridden by Eddie Arcaro, he won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941 by capturing the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. He also won the Lawrence Realization Stakes and the Travers Stakes that year. He was voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year for 1941 and repeated as Horse of the Year in 1942. 

Whirlaway, ridden by George Woolf (called "The Iceman"), who won the Pimlico Special in 1938 on Seabiscuit, 1940 on Challedon, and 1942 on Whirlaway, rode the 1941 Triple Crown winner at a leisurely pace during the 1942 Special in a walkover.  No opponent had been found to challenge the great horse for the race.  

Arcaro, who successfully rode Whirlaway in all his 3-year-old victories, missed the 1942 season because of racing infractions and was warned off all American tracks. Woolf, who gleefully took the reins of Whirlaway for most of the 1942 season, was busted after bringing Whirlaway to the position of all-time money winner.  After the race that made Whirlaway the all-time money winner, Woolf was asked by turfwriters if Whirlaway was the greatest horse he had ever ridden. He made the most outspoken comment of his career by declaring that "... no, Seabiscuit was the greatest horse I have ever ridden."  Woolf an outspoken but knowledgeable critic of pedigree, had stated publicly many times he didn't respect Blenheim II as a stud, even though Blenheim II had great bloodlines himself.  Woolf wasn't off-target by much.  Whirlaway, Jet Pilot, and Fervent were about the only champions from literally hundreds of offspring to prove out.  Jet Pilot won the Kentucky Derby in 1947.  Fervent won the Pimlico Special in 1947.  

Woolf didn't witness these horses or their victories, having been killed in a racing accident at Santa Anita Racetrack in January 1946. 

At age 5, Whirlaway was retired to stud and later shipped to France to stand for Marcel Boussac at his Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard. 

Whirlaway was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1959. In The Blood-Horse ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Whirlaway was ranked No. 26.

The Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project, otherwise known as CASP , is the online resource for anyone interested in how Shakespeare's plays have been transformed and adapted in Canada. The Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project is an integrated virtual learning, teaching, and research commons devoted to the study of Shakespeare in Canada. The launch of its website marked the first stage of an intensive collaborative research effort whose next phase will involve the establishment of the Centre for Canadian Shakespeare Studies Online at the University of Guelph . Plans include further digitization of CASP's extensive archival holdings (currently CASP has been able to digitize less than 10% of what it holds in its hard copy archives), the full bilingualization of the site (French/English), and the creation of learning modules for all educational levels based on the materials archived to the site. CASP is the first research project of its kind anywhere in the world devoted to the systematic exploration and documentation of the ways in which Shakespeare has been adapted into (and out of) a national, multicultural theatrical practice and is now recognized as the largest and most sophisticated website in the world devoted to Shakespeare.  One of the defining features of Canada's cultural (theatrical) heritage is the extent to which it relies on a dialogue with traditional Shakespearean theatre.

Developed by the University of Guelph's  Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project (CASP), directed by Dr. Daniel Fischlin (School of English and Theatre Studies), the site houses an as-close-to comprehensive (and ever-growing), digital archive of performances, productions, playwrights, and other materials that date from pre-Canadian Confederation times to the present day. Included in the CASP list of playwrights are such names as Timothy Findley, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Djanet Sears, Daniel David Moses, Rick Miller , and Robert Lepage. All told, at launch time (April 2004), the CASP website contained well over seven thousand pages of information on over 450 plays, which will be added to as the project continues. CASP is actually two integrated websites, one an administrative database site, the other the public site that is connected to portions of the Database. CASP is unique in how it has developed an innovative research mechanism that allows for inputting of research results from anywhere in the world through its administrative database site, something CASP conceptualized and designed from the ground up.

Its innovative, ongoing research activities have already attracted national and international media recognition (including feature write-ups in The Globe and Mail (Caldwell,  When Pucks collide ), The Chronicle of Higher Education (Birchard,  U. of Guelph Unveils Largest Website on Shakespeare ), national radio and television interviews, and the visits of many international scholars working on related materials). The project website, to which many of CASP s findings have been published, has generated a huge volume of site visits since the launch of the site in April, 2004. Currently the site is developing bilingual materials related to French Canada and Shakespeare with an intended launch in Summer of 2006. These materials will effectively double the size of what is already a massive site with enormous resources including scripts, critical writings, images, audio, film, and various multimedia (including a soon to be released Shakespeare literacy game targeted at a youth audience).

Further, the signing of the recent Memorandum of Understanding with the Stratford Festival of Canada () (April 2005), after more than a year of negotiation and design, articulates a move toward a hybrid site co-developed with Stratford (intended launch date January 2007), that will combine CASP's intepretative, critical, and archival expertise with Stratford's performance focus to create a major new site devoted to Shakespeare and pedagogy. The site will be housed at the University of Guelph. The vision is to create the most sophisticated learning commons in the world devoted to Shakespearean pedagogy with a focus on performance and cultural and linguistic literacy.

The CASP project, which includes both the public web site and hard copy archives of all the plays and play materials it catalogues, has been funded by a Premier s Research Excellence Award (PREA) provided by the Province of Ontario and by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Standard Research Grant.

For better or worse, Canada's theatrical past is profoundly connected to Shakespeare, with productions, revisions, adaptations, and any number of spin-off representations a key feature of the Canadian cultural landscape. As stated in the Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia entry on Shakespeare:

"The most produced non-Canadian playwright, his works are at the foundation of theatre in this country  and are performed in all styles at virtually all the major theatres, in French and in English, across the nation. Like Molière , the works of Shakespeare appear as keystones throughout the history of theatre here Canada. His were among the first works performed in the New World, they were the raison d'être of the foundation of the nation's largest theatre (Stratford Festival), and they are still being taught in schools, with interpretations which change from era to era." ("Shakespeare," Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia)

As much as this Shakespearean presence is a function of Canada's colonial heritage with its dependency on immigrant cultures, it is also a function of how a new and emergent culture has sought to define itself in dialogue (and frequently against) the Shakespearean tradition. CASP is an attempt to document the fascinating permutations this dialogue has taken with the understanding that Shakespeare (or the Shakespeare effect) is situated at a key nexus in a wide array of cultural activities and referents.

Moreover, Canadian scholarship has played a crucial role in providing the necessary social, historical, economic, religious and archival contexts for understanding the theatrical work Shakespeare produced. The Records of Early English Drama project housed at the University of Toronto, for instance, "provide proof that a man like Shakespeare  without a university education, untrained in the classical theatre tradition of the time, unacquainted with the manners of aristocracy  actually could have written the plays that are now universally regarded as the greatest in drama and literature" (Monika Stephenson. "Canadian scholarship gives the Bard a boost." The Globe and Mail. May 1, 2004. F9).

CASP was conceived as an attempt to produce an archive of lost or forgotten theatrical materials and practices important both to Canada s theatrical and literary histories, but also to Canada s emergent sense of itself as a nation as mediated by these same materials and practices. To that end, we have collected information on over 450 plays in which some form of Shakespearean adaptation is at work. These plays span hundreds of years (over three centuries) in chronology and document a vast range of local, regional, national, transnational and multicultural theatrical realities that form a significant part of Canada's cultural heritage.

The sheer quantity of theatrical activity occurring in the genre of Shakespearean adaptation over an extended historical period marks a significant economic, artistic, cultural, and social investment in doing "something" to/with Shakespeare. CASP notes that this activity is over and above the theatrical work in which more conventional stagings and productions of Shakespeare occur (themselves always potentially adaptations).

Moreover, these adaptations, if anything, reinforce the crucial linkage between works of the imagination and the political and social contexts out of which they emerge. As Jane Henderson suggests in a recent online article linking Shakespeare to Canadian politics, especially in relation to issues of marriage and domesticity, "both art and politics are putting out ideas about the same thing; namely, they are imagining how people could identify and organize their experiences of attraction and devotion. Shakespeare's text is an inherited institution, as is the Canadian federal definition of terms of marriage" (Paul Martin, Meet Shakespeare). Such an association is but one of a multiple set of intersections between theatrical activity that uses Shakespeare as a key framing device and the wider cultural patternings and activities to which Shakespearean adaptation is pertinent.

Shakespeare's use of a wide variety of adaptive techniques and source texts in his theatrical writing and the recent explosion of Shakespearean adaptation studies also provide an important context for understanding the impetus behind CASP.

The diversity of Shakespearean adaptation in Canada is staggering: from aboriginal and African-Canadian theatre through to colonial, postcolonial, fringe, multicultural, minority, popular culture, gay, lesbian, queer, and youth theatre. The CASP digital archive includes adaptations with a range of thematic predilections: from cowboy Shakespeare to vampire Shakespeare to club (rave and DJ) Shakespeare to hockey Shakespeare to TheatreSports Shakespeare to Shakespeare and the October Crisis of 1970.

In response to this diversity, the CASP website was designed to have multiple uses for a range of audiences  from students and teachers looking for access to classroom materials through to playgoers and theatre practitioners looking for production details and other sorts of information.
The CASP site collects materials with inclusiveness as a key operating principle. Materials made available on the CASP website represent only a small portion of the materials collected in a hard copy archive housed in the CASP offices at the University of Guelph. It is CASP's intention to digitize as many of these materials as possible in the future.

A number of features make the CASP site unique:
The CASP Online Anthology (), consisting of over 35 texts (most of them playscripts), is the first of its kind, and completely free to anyone with access to a web browser, making accessible a variety of Canadian playscripts and historical texts that have been either lost or unavailable until now. For instance, CASP published for the first time John Wilson Bengough s Puffe and Co., or Hamlet, Prince of Dry Goods, a comic play by Canada s internationally famous cartoonist that had been lost for over a century. A substantial portion of the materials gathered in the CASP archives are distinctive, critically unrecognized, virtually unknown, or unpublished.
Using the technical expertise of programmers working for the University of Guelph, CASP built an online database designed specifically for recording literary and theatrical information. It is fully searchable and contains significant amounts of data (on playwrights, productions of plays, awards, historical context, digital links and information, and so forth) that is constantly being updated. The content of this database is unique  no other database of its sort exists anywhere.
CASP also developed a Spotlight page that allowed it to digitize and organize materials from within its archives as a special focus section thus providing access to a focussed grouping of materials that will be useful in a range of pedagogical contexts. The first spotlight page launched by CASP was Aboriginal Adaptations of Shakespeare ().
The information in the CASP Online Anthology and database is complemented by links to a range of secondary sources and multimedia materials (). CASP has digitally recorded and transcribed exclusive interviews done with a variety of playwrights and have made them available online. It has also included clips from movies, photos, political cartoons in which Shakespearean referents figure, rare historical documents (like the first program for the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario), and, where possible, other relevant audiovisual materials.

CASP trains and funds, in a collaborative research context, undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs at the University of Guelph's School of English and Theatre Studies (SETS). Many of its trainees go on to do further graduate work in the field (there are currently 4 CASP graduates completing PhDs in overlapped areas of study). CASP has trained and employed some 35 graduate and undergraduate students and has employed close to 50 people in a variety of functions since its inception. CASP is currently one of the largest digital humanities research projects in Canada with a strong record of training numerous students and of achieving its deliverables in a timely manner.

Giuseppe Zamboni was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and physicist who invented the Zamboni pile or "dry" pile.
 
Biography.
He was born at Venice (or depending on the source Verona), in northern Italy), June, 1776. 
 
Shortly after completing his studies in the seminary at Verona, abbate Zamboni was appointed to the chair of physics in the lyceum of that city.
 
He died in Venice on July 25, 1846.

Invention.
Zamboni is known to students of physics for an improved of the dry pile which he invented in 1812. It consists of a number of paper discs coated with zinc foil on one side and manganese dioxide on the other; the moisture of the paper serves as a conductor.
 
By pressing a large number of such discs together in a glass tube, an electromotive force can be obtained that is sufficient enough to deflect the leaves of an ordinary electroscope. By bringing the terminal knobs of the pile near each other and suspending a light brass ball between them, Zamboni devised what was called an electrostatic clock. The device is so named because the ball oscillating between the knobs looks like a pendulum.
 
In the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University, the terminals of such a pile are fitted with bells that have been continuously ringing for the last fifty years.  The Zamboni pile is not a hypothetical perpetual motion device, as all action stops when the zinc is completely oxidized or the manganese exhausted.  
 
Writings.
Among Zamboni's works are: "Della pila elettrica a secco" (Venice, 1812); "L'elettromotore perpetuo" (Venice, 1820); "Descrizione d'un nuovo galvanometro" (Venice, 1833).

Ntdetect.com is a component of Microsoft Windows NT operating systems that operate on the x86 architecture. It is used during the Windows NT Startup Process, and is responsible for detecting basic hardware that will be required to start the operating system.

Overview.
Ntdetect.com is invoked by NTLDR, and returns the information it gathers to NTLDR when finished, so that it can then be passed on to Ntoskrnl.exe, the Windows kernel.

Ntdetect.com is used on computers that use BIOS firmware. Computers with Extensible Firmware Interface, such as IA-64, use a method of device-detection that is not tied to the operating system.

Hardware detection operates somewhat differently depending on whether or not Advanced Configuration and Power Interface is supported by the hardware. If ACPI is supported, the list of found devices is handed to the kernel, Windows will take responsibility for assigning each device some resources. On older hardware, where ACPI is not supported, the BIOS takes responsibility for assigning resources, not the operating system, so this information is passed to the kernel as well.

In addition, Ntdetect.com will make a determination as to which hardware profile to use. Windows supports multiple distinct hardware profiles, which allows a single copy of Windows to work well in situations where the hardware changes between specific layouts on a regular basis. This is common with portable computers that connect to a docking station.

In Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems, ntdetect.com only supports ACPI, so that Windows will be able to control hardware resource allocation on every machine in the same way.  Hardware profiles are also no longer supported in Windows Vista.

The information gathered by ntdetect.com is stored in the HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION key in the registry at a later stage in the boot process.

Classes of hardware detected.

 Hardware date & time;
 Bus and adapter types;

Troubleshooting.
To aid in troubleshooting, Microsoft has made available "debug" versions of Ntdetect.com which will display detailed information about the hardware that was detected.

<doc id="4376268" title="South Australian general election, 1997" nonfiltered="536" processed="530" dbindex="1480541">

Legislative elections for State Parliament were held in South Australia on 11 October 1997.


Background.

Following the 1993 landslide to the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, led by Mike Rann held just 11 seats in the House of Assembly. The Liberals held 36 seats and there were no independent or minor party members in the House of Assembly. (They had held a record 37, but lost one in a by-election in 1994). However the Liberals had internal tensions, and John Olsen had successfully challenged Dean Brown for the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1996 and had been Premier of South Australia for around 12 months on election day.  The margin of 25 seats was seen as insurmountable for the Labor Party despite the Liberal leadership change. 

The election was held just after the end of the football season (when the state had been captivated by the Adelaide Crows unexpectedly winning the AFL premiership), leaving only one week for campaigning uninterrupted by football. This was expected to work in the government's favour, though it seems it had the opposite effect.

On February 6, 2007, Mike Rann told parliament that some in the Liberal party had leaked information to him before and during the election campaign. The following quote by Rann is from Hansard on 6/2/2007:

You asked me a question and I will give you a 55-minute answer, because you will remem­ber one day when I came into this place and I had, I think, 880 pages of cabinet and other documents... I remember being telephoned and told to go to a certain cafe, not in a white car but in a taxi, and then to walk in a zigzag fashion through the streets of a suburb, where I was to be handed cabinet documents. So much for their cabinet solidarity and cabinet confidentiality! There was a queue on the telephone telling us what had happened the day before. It was the same during the 1997 election campaign. People thought, `How does this guy (the leader of the opposition at the time) know intuitively exactly what John Olsen is doing the next day?' It was because I was being phoned and told! So, do not talk to me about cabinet solidari­ty lest I come in here and start naming names, which will set off another generation of disputation on the other side of the house. Anyway, cabinet approved, among other things, on 20 December 2006 minister Lomax-Smith's proposed statement and approved her to announce publicly that she opposed the proposal in cabinet. She did so because we agreed that she should be able to do so. Somehow I do not think that John Olsen agreed to what happened when I was getting the phone call at 6 o'clock in the morning and at midnight, and walking in a zigzag pattern through suburbs to be handed a cabinet bag and cabinet documents. We have a different approach. We agreed to it. It was a cabinet decision to agree to it. So, please, ask me some more questions, because there were two different camps involved in this leaking to the then poor unpopular leader of the opposition, and I am more than happy to name names.;

Election Procedure.
Under its state constitution, South Australia holds legislative elections approximately every four years. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election campaign must run for a minimum of 25 days and a maximum of 55 days.

In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised key dates for this election of all 47 members of the House of Assembly and eleven members of the Legislative Council:
 Close of rolls;
 Nominations;
 Polling Day;
 Return of Writs;

House of Assembly Results.

To the surprise of most observers, the Labor Party polled exceptionally well, gaining 10 seats and coming within a couple of seats of winning government.  The Liberals lost a massive 13 seats; 10 to Labor, one to the Nationals and two to conservative independents. 

So the numbers were: Liberal 23 seats, Labor 21, Nationals 1 (Karlene Maywald), and two conservative independents (Mitch Williams and Rory McEwen). This left the Liberals one short of a majority, though they had the support of the National and Independents, and Williams later joined the Liberal party.

Post-election Pendulum.










Legislative Council Results.

In the Legislative Council, voter disquiet was reflected in the fact that 3 of the 11 candidates were from minor parties, with the Australian Democrats having two MLCs elected for the first time. Elected were 4 Liberal, 4 Labor, 2 Australian Democrats, and No Pokies candidate Nick Xenophon. Carrying over from the 1993 election were 6 Liberal, 4 Labor, 1 Democrat; leaving the numbers at: 10 Liberal, 8 Labor, 3 Democrats, 1 No Pokies.

Both on 1.72%, the HEMP Legalise Marijuana party received 15432 votes and the SA Greens received 15377 votes.


Legacy.
The 1997 result put Labor within striking distance of winning government at the next election in 2002.  John Olsen was left with internal disquiet over the leadership challenge and poor election result while his opponent, Mike Rann was seen to have 'won' the campaign despite losing the election.

The United Corporations and Mercantile Union (UCMU) is a Sri Lankan Unionwhich brings together workers in the public sector.

The UCMU was founded in 1968. Dr N.M. Perera became its President and Anil Moonesinghe became its General Secretary. Moonesinghe went around the country from factory to factory and built up a union of several tens of thousands of members. One of his lieutenants in this task was Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who became an MP in 1970. At the 1970 General Election, the UCMU also sponsored the candidature of the Chairman of its Vidyodaya University branch, Mahinda Rajapaksa who was later to become Prime Minister and then President of Sri Lanka.

In 1970, when Anil Moonesinghe went to the Ceylon Transport Board as Chairman, he was succeeded as General Secretary by Percy Wickremasekera. After the death of Dr N.M. Perera in 1979, Anil Moonesinghe became President.

<doc id="5553131" title="Chicago 2016 Olympic bid" nonfiltered="540" processed="533" dbindex="1480545">

The Chicago 2016 Olympic bid is a reference to an attempt by the City of Chicago and other cities, townships and villages in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin to be chosen by the United States Olympic Committee as the official United States bid for the International Olympic Committee 2016 Summer Olympics host city competition. On July 26, 2006, the USOC had narrowed its list of candidates to Chicago and Los Angeles (San Francisco dropped out in November 2006).

It should be noted that Chicago has the dubious distinction of being the only city to have had an Olympics taken away; the 1904 Summer Olympics were originally supposed to be held in Chicago, but were moved to St. Louis to coincide with the 1904 World's Fair.

United States Olympic Committee.


The USOC's chairman, Peter Ueberroth, visited potential host cities during the month of May 2006. Ueberroth and his party visited Chicago on May 10.

Plan.

Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was officially welcomed in Beijing by the government of the People's Republic of China during the week of May 15, 2006, when the mayor discussed Chicago's venture; he is the only mayor of an American city vying for the 2016 Summer Olympics to have been welcomed to Beijing on official Olympic business. 

Chicago's chances for hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics are bolstered by preliminary commitments made by major corporations and wealthy Chicago philanthropists; promised participation in the planning process by community and government leaders (including the Chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, a political party usually opposed to Daley); and the enthusiasm of the citizenry.  Opinion polls conducted by local newspapers in early 2006 suggested that public support for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Chicago could be as high as 80 to 85 percent.  Most importantly, the city's existing infrastructure and venue options are considerably more substantial than the offerings available in other interested cities.  Bob Ctvrtlik, part of the initial assessment team, said, "It's got all the amenities that would make this a wonderful experience for our athletes." Ueberroth added, "Chicago is going in the right direction, and we are impressed by that."

Financing.
Ueberroth and members of the national committee met with Daley on May 10 2006 for the initial assessment. On the same day, with permission from Ueberroth, Daley appointed business executive Patrick G. Ryan of Aon Corporation and part-owner of the Chicago Bears to lead the city's bid process, especially in areas of corporate participation in fundraising. In previous years, Daley opposed possible bids for the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games owing to former international committee financial-guarantee requirements. Those requirements have been relaxed in favor of a new philosophy in which the Olympic Games would become smaller in terms of construction and related costs.  Early cost estimates hover at $5 billion, with $1 billion needed for a new Olympic stadium in Chicago. 



Venues.
Despite the need for an Olympic stadium, Chicago has dozens of existing sport venues: Soldier Field, United Center, U.S. Cellular Field, Wrigley Field, Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, and the new Toyota Park in Bridgeview.  Venues at Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Northern Illinois University, among others, are also available and have been mentioned in early news reports as possibilities.  Navy Pier and the lakefront could host all beach and water events.  Other regional mayors have offered venues in Indiana and Wisconsin, including use of the University of Notre Dame facilities.



Stadium.
Chicago initially proposed building a temporary 80,000 seat stadium adjacent to Soldier Field to act as the main stadium, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the track and field events.   Previously, according to the Chicago Tribune, Mayor Daley had expressed a desire for an additional NFL franchise to come to Chicago in order to obtain the 80,000 seat stadium needed to host an Olympics.  The plan has since been revised to include a 95,000-seat stadium inside Washington Park on the south side of the city.  After the games, it would be converted to a 10,000-seat track and field venue that could also host other events.

Chicago's reputation as a major convention hosting center will also help its cause.  The main convention center, McCormick Place, is the largest convention center in the United States and is undergoing an expansion that will be completed in 2007.  The city of Chicago has over 50,000 hotel rooms in the immediate downtown area and has the largest skilled-labor workforce in the U.S. catering to conventions and other large-scale media events.

Sport culture.
Chicago benefits from a strong sports culture and is arguably one of the most sport-oriented cities in the United States.   On Aug. 1, 2006, it was named "Best Sports City" by The Sporting News. Chicagoans are famous for their rabid support of their home teams: the Chicago Bears, Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, the Chicago Bulls, and more recently, the Chicago Fire.  Other events, such as the Chicago Marathon, one of the largest marathon events worldwide, will also play a part in Chicago's Olympic-planning process.

Experience.

Chicago successfully hosted the International Gay Games VII from July 15 to July 22, 2006, one of the first tests to measure Olympic host city viability.  Chicago has hosted major and historic world gatherings in the past, including the famous 1893 Columbian Exposition, the 1933 World's Fair, the 1959 Pan American Games, as well as matches for the 1994 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament.  Chicago was supposed to host the 1904 Summer Olympics but these were removed from the city and given to Saint Louis to coincide with its Louisiana Purchase Exposition (more commonly known as the Saint Louis World's Fair).  Chicago has never been happy with its distinction as one of the few cities to have an Olympic Games taken away, and this historical issue could play to Chicago's favor.  

Chicago was also the first host of the Special Olympics in 1968.

Miscellaneous.
It is expected that Chicago's world-class architecture, renowned skyline, multi-cultural, historical, and pop-cultural contributions will be positive factors as the Olympics bid is weighed.

Chicago's geographic location also counts in its favor.  Its central position within the United States means that its time zone is well-suited to American television coverage. The NBC television network and its sister cable broadcasters (under the NBC Universal banner) is by far the largest media vendor and contract purchaser of the Olympic Games.

Michael Jordan has become an unofficial spokesman for Chicago's bid.

Recent developments.
On June 23, 2006, five United States candidates met in California to offer official presentations to the USOC Board of Directors. Chicago Tribune reported of the event on June 24, "USOC officials indicated they could whittle down the field of five contenders in as soon as three weeks." The article also stated, "Observers say it's likely to be a three-way horse race between.... San Francisco, Chicago and Olympic veteran Los Angeles." As predicted, the USOC on July 26, 2006, officially named San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago as the three US finalists for the 2016 Olympics, dropping Philadelphia and Houston.However, on November 13, 2006, San Francisco withdrew its bid from the national selection process, leaving Chicago and Los Angeles as the only contenders in the U.S. bid.

The Chicago 2016 Exploratory Committee has launched its official Web site at www.chicago2016.org.

On September 21, 2006, Mayor Daley unveiled a revised plan for the main stadium, which would host the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as track and field events.  The plan calls for a 95,000 seat stadium to be constructed in Washington Park, on Chicago's South Side.  The plan's preliminary design mimics the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, making use of the Midway Plaisance and the surrounding neighborhoods of Hyde Park and Woodlawn.  The stadium would be temporary, and would be mostly dismantled into a 10,000-seat track and field stadium and event complex after the games.  According to the Chicago Sun-Times, local Aldermen strongly support this plan.

On January 9th, the USOC announced that they will go forward in presenting an American bid to the international competition for the 2016 games.  The next step was for the city of Los Angeles and Chicago to have a bid book ready for the committe by January 22nd for review. On April 14, the evaluation team will present its findings to the USOC board of directors, cities will make their final presentations and the candidate city will be chosen. The candidate city must be submitted to the International Olympic Committee on September 15th. The host will be chosen in 2009.

The Body is a 2001 film based on a novel by Richard Sapir, and starring Antonio Banderas and Olivia Williams.

The movie follows Father Matt Gutierrez (Banderas), a Jesuit priest sent by the Vatican to investigate an archaeologic finding by Dr. Sharon Golban (Williams) which is suspected to be the remains of the body of Jesus Christ. This finding puts Gutierrez' faith and his doubts in constant confrontation with Golban's scientific views.

Also, the finding stirres the political problems between Palestine and Israel in the area, while also shaking the foundations of Christianity itself. Both of these problems put Dr. Golban, and Gutierrez himself, in danger. 

Plot.

Dr. Sharon Golban (Williams) finds an ancient skeleton in Jerusalem in a rich man's tomb. Coloration of the wrist and leg bones indicates the cause of death was crucifixion. other signs, include a gold coin bearing the marks of Pontius Pilate and faint markings around the skull, lead authorities to suspect that these could be the bones of Christ. The different reactions of politicians, clerics, religious extremists some prepared to use terror to gain their ends to the religious, cultural and political implications of the find, make life difficult and dangerous for the investigators as they seek to unearth
the truth.

Father Matt Gutierrez, is assigned by the Vatican to investigate the case and to protect the Christian faith. Troubled by his case, he comes to understand that it is the Church that he is protecting and not the faith.

 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the region where the body is found. Both sides believe that control of the site will give them an upper hand in the conflict.
 The alleged excessive control of the Vatican and the Catholic church over important issues  to protect their own interests.
 The importance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in the Christian faith.

<doc id="1308662" title="Glossopteris" nonfiltered="542" processed="535" dbindex="1480547">
Glossopteris (Greek glossa, meaning "tongue", because the leaves were tongue-shaped) is the largest and best-known genus of the extinct order of seed ferns known as Glossopteridales. Long considered a fern after its discovery in 1824, it was later assigned to the gymnosperms. The genus is placed in the division Pteridospermatophyta. 

Glossopteris was a woody, seed-bearing shrub or tree, 4-6 m in height. They had a softwood interior that resembles conifers of the family Araucariaceae. Seeds and pollen-containing organs were borne in clusters at the tips of slender stalks attached to the leaves. Still, some species may have borne seeds in cone-like structures. They are believed to have grown in very wet soil conditions, similar to the modern Bald Cypress. The leaves could exceed 30 cm in length.

The Glossopteridales arose during the Permian on the great southern continent of Gondwana. These plants went on to become a dominant part of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian and early Triassic periods, though they dwindled to extinction by the end of the Triassic.

Glossopteris tapered upwards like a Christmas tree. Instead of needles, they had large, broad lance- or tongue-shaped leaves that fell to the ground at the end of summer. It is unknown if the leaves turned colors, but it seems likely. The fossilized tree rings in the Glossopteris trees reveal that they grew steadily each summer and abruptly stopped for winter. 

More than 70 fossil species of this genus have been recognized in India alone, with additional species from South America, Australia, Africa, and Antarctica. Only a few fossils from the northern hemisphere have been considered as members of this group, but these are not identified with great certainty.

Glossopteris fossils are surprisingly homogeneous and are distributed throughout the southern hemisphere. Twenty species of leaves found in Antarctica are common in the rocks of similar geologic age in India, located north of the equator and half a world away. Seeds, much too large to be windborne, could not have blown across thousands of miles of open sea, nor could they have floated across vast oceans. Facts such as these led the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to deduce that there had once been a land bridge between these areas. He named this large land mass Gondwanaland (named after the district in India where the plant Glossopteris was found). These same facts would also lend support to Alfred Wegener's Continental drift theory.

Synopsis.

Rød Snø portrays the war-time situation in Nössemark, Sweden, just across the Norwegian border during November 1942. Here lies a small motel called Linds Pensionat, the situation at which is supposedly carefree. But across the border the war rages on, and Sweden - despite their neutrality - is not left alone. There are spies everywhere, and nobody knows exactly who to trust and not.

The series begins with Anne Eriksen on her way to visit the Linds, as she used to spend almost every vacation there when she was younger. Almost immediately strange things begin to happen, things that are unmistakably related to the war. The people at the motel suspect somebody in their circle is working for the Germans, and the list of suspects grows further with every new visitor.

Application-oriented networking (AON) involves network devices designed to aid in computer-to-computer application integration.

Application-oriented networking was popularized by Cisco Systems in response to increasing use of XML messaging (combined with related standards such as XSLT, XPath and XQuery) to link miscellaneous applications, data sources and other computing assets.

Many of the operations required to mediate between applications, or to monitor their transactions, can be built into network devices that are optimized for the purpose.

The rules and policies for performing these operations, also expressed in XML, are specified separately and downloaded as required. Cisco has adopted the AON acronym as the name of a family of products that function in this way.

Three Rivers is located at  (36.454212, -118.886466).
Three Rivers is a census-designated place (CDP) in Tulare County, California, United States. The population was 2,248 at the 2000 census.

The town's name comes from its location near the junction of the North, Middle and South Forks of the Kaweah River.

Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 117.5 km² (45.3 mi²), all land.

Demographics.
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,248 people, 985 households, and 659 families residing in the CDP.  The population density was 19.1/km² (49.6/mi²).  There were 1,217 housing units at an average density of 10.4/km² (26.8/mi²).  The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.86% White, 0.22% African American, 1.29% Native American, 0.67% Asian, 0.13% Pacific Islander, 3.74% from other races, and 4.09% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.58% of the population.

There were 985 households out of which 24.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.9% were married couples living together, 7.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.0% were non-families. 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Three Rivers was one site of a handful of U.S. boarding schools run by the Hare Krishna movement. These schools, called "gurukulas," were closed by the mid-1980s. Other locations included Los Angeles; Moundsville, W. Va.; and Dallas.

Rhodesian Pioneers.
The Three Rivers cemetery contains the bodies of nine Rhodesian pioneers who lived in Africa ca. 1900 and fought in several Anglo-African wars:
Frederick Russell Burnham (May 11, 1861 - September 1, 1947), the highly decorated Scout, best known for his service in the First Matabele War, Second Matabele War, the Second Boer War, and for teaching woodcraft (i.e., scoutcraft) to Robert Baden-Powell, becoming one of the inspirations to the founding of the Boy Scouts and recognized today as the father of the international scouting movement.
Blanche Blick Burnham (1862 - 1939), wife of Fred Burnham, lived in Africa during the First Matabele War and the Second Matabele War.
Roderick Deane Burnham (August 22, 1886 - July 1, 1976), son of Fred & Blanche Burnham, moved to Africa at age 4 and lived there from 1893-1897.  Served in World War I and went on to lead a rich and adventurous life after finding oil at Dominguez Hills, California.
John C. Blick (1875 - 1960), a fearless man who fought and won a famous hand-to-hand duel with a Ndebele after the charge broke the impis on their last effort to take Bulawayo in the Second Matabele War.
Judd Dunning Blick (March 17, 1873 - December 9, 1951), participated in the Barotseland expedition of 1895, during which he and his party nearly died of thirst, and fought in the Second Matabele War. ;
Pearl "Pete" Ingram Mills (1871 - 1933), a Montana cowboy who was one of only three men to survive the Shangani Patrol (along with Burnham) during the First Matabele War.  Also fought in the Second Matabele War.
Grace Blick Ingram (July 22, 1870 - May 22, 1951), wife of Pete Ingram and a member of the Blick clan.
Homer Blick, fought in the Second Matabele War.
James S. Blick (November 15, 1833 - October 14, 1916), father of the Blick family, fought in the Second Matabele War.

The Burnhams and the Blicks started a cattle ranch, La Cuesta, in Three Rivers and built homes there.  The scenery at Three Rivers is said to be almost identical to that of the Rhodesian kopje country.

Dr. Robert F. Chandler, Jr., 1988 winner of the World Food Prize, was an individual whose work touched all corners of the globe, from Asia and the Far East to Africa and Latin America. 

 Biographical information .

Dr. Chandler was born on June 22, 1907, in Ohio, grew up in Maine, and earned a 1934 Ph.D. from the University of Maryland. He passed away on March 23, 1999, at the age of 91. In a scientific and administrative career that spanned seventy years, he inspired scores of young and talented scientists to work for the betterment of human nutrition and improved rural income. Many of his protégés advanced to become leaders in agricultural research. Dr. Chandler was remembered by fellow World Food Prize Laureate Dr. M.S. Swaminathan as  a scientist of vision and conviction, warmth and wisdom, and of great inner strength. The impact of his leadership and dynamism was widely felt in Asia within a short period. 

Academic and research career.

Originally a professor of forest soils at Cornell University, Dr. Chandler was in 1946 named director of agricultural research at the University of New Hampshire and from 1950 to 1954 served as that institution s president. During that time he also studied soils in Mexico, where from 1954 to 1958 he directed research for the Rockefeller Foundation. 

Founding Director of IRRI .

By the late 1950s, the population of Asia was expanding rapidly and the outlook for feeding the increasing number of people was bleak. Many experts, predicting that the region would outgrow its food production capacities by 1975, warned of chronic, widespread famine. This was the situation when Dr. Chandler became the founding director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Baños, the Philippines. 

His experience in science and administration made him a natural choice to initiate the IRRI program in 1959, which he and his wife, Sunny, did with little more than a typewriter in a Manila hotel room. 

From the outset, Dr. Chandler knew that the production of rice, the primary staple for more than four-fifths of Asia's population, would play a paramount role in curtailing hunger. To keep pace with the growing population, however, rice production had to increase by more than five million tons annually.

Dr. Chandler brought together a staff of administrators and attracted top scientists from around the globe, unified in their focus on the agricultural needs of the developing world. Concentrating on collecting existing Asian rice breeds and genetically improving them, they produced varieties specially developed to have double and triple the yield potential of traditional rice plants. As early as 1963, IRRI researcher and 1996 World Food Prize Laureate Henry Beachell had already identified the plants that would become the IR8 strain lauded as  miracle rice.  These and other varieties developed at IRRI brought a 66% increase in rice production in Asia, while the population rose 47%. Today, the new rice varieties are grown on 500,000 km² across the continent.

In reality, the rapid advances in rice production that Dr. Chandler and his eminent staff made were not a miracle, but the product of hard work, determination, and years of research. The success of Dr. Chandler's work with IRRI spurred the development of an international network of agricultural research centers supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. Sixteen centers are currently located on nearly every continent, each focusing on particular crops, livestock, or problems in food production. 

After guiding IRRI through its first decade, Dr. Chandler become the founding director of the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) in Taiwan in 1972. Under his leadership, AVRDC developed vegetable varieties for the tropics, including a heat-tolerant tomato with a yield of 20 tons per hectare. For more than 30 years, AVRDC varieties have enriched the diets of millions of people, especially women and children suffering from a lack of micronutrients, and the center maintains Dr. Chandler s founding mission in its outreach activities across Asia and Africa and in Central America.

After retiring from full-time work in 1975, Dr. Chandler continued his mission through consultant assignments with the Near East Foundation, the Rockefeller and Ford foundations, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the World Bank. He received the Presidential End Hunger Award in 1986, which cited his "continued, demonstrated vision, initiative and leadership in the effort to achieve a world without hunger."

Honors and recognition.

In 1966, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research honored Dr. Chandler s contribution to IRRI s achievements, stating, "His own personal qualities as a critical scientist and a dynamic leader have been primarily responsible for the emergence of the International Rice Research Institute as the finest rice research center in the world...His contributions therefore lie not only in the practical application of science for human welfare, but in the evolution of a pattern of research administration conducive to science becoming an instrument of social progress in the developing nations." Dr. S.K. DeDatta, an IRRI agronomist from 1964 to 1991, credited Dr. Chandler for his commitment to and leadership in staving off hunger in Asia, saying  researchers  brains were the only limitations at IRRI in the early days.  

The countries that most immediately and directly benefited from Dr. Chandler s vision were quick to laud his efforts. He was honored with India s Gold Medal Award in 1966, Pakistan s Sitara-I-Imtiaz Award in 1968, Indonesia s Star of Merit and the Philippines  Golden Heart Award in 1972, and China s Order of the Brilliant Star in 1975.

The Malay Heritage Centre (Malay: Taman Warisan Melayu; Chinese:         ) is a cultural centre in Singapore to showcase the heritage, culture and history of Malay Singaporeans. Located at Sultan Gate of Kampong Glam, the 0.8-hectare (2-acre) centre was launched on 27 November 2004. 

History.
Sultan Gate was once the Istana Kampong Glam (or the Sultan's Palace) and Gedung Kuning (or Yellow Mansion), and was part of a larger original compound that led to the Beach Road frontage. Sultan Gate has been known as such since the 1950s.

The Malay Heritage Foundation, formed in 28 July 1999, embarked on a major restoration project of the Istana Kampong Glam in 1999. Completed in 2004, it reopened as the Malay Heritage Centre.

Attractions.
The centre houses the Malay Heritage Museum, which aims to preserve and showcase the culture and heritage of Malays in Singapore through historic artefacts, multimedia and diorama displays, and other exhibits. The centre also organizes cultural programmes related to music, dance and costumes. Workshops on pottery and batik fabric art are also being held.

On the grounds of the Malay Heritage Centre are Gelam trees, the replica of a Bugis prahu or boat, and information markers on the history of the Bugis people and their trade.

Lake Apopka is one of the largest lakes in Florida in the United States. It is located west of Orlando and mostly in Orange County, but the western part is in Lake County. In the late 1990's, birds at the lake were actually falling from the sky and dying in large numbers. Most of the dead birds were White Pelicans, but Great Egrets and Ring-billed gulls made up most of the other deaths. The deaths were thought to be tied to pesticides that farmers depended on for decades, called organochlorines.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service warned that people shouldn't eat fish caught in Lake Apopka, since the chemicals were labeled as a possible cause for the deaths.

Georges Boillot, born August 3, 1884   died April 21, 1916, was a French Grand Prix motor racing driver and World War I fighter pilot.

Born in Valentigney, Doubs, Boillot was a mechanic by training who began automobile racing in 1908. He went on to join drivers Paul Zuccarelli and Jules Goux to help create a novel range of racing cars as part of the Peugeot team. He debuted with them in 1909 in the Coupe de l'Auto at Rambouillet and in 1910, went to Italy to compete in the Targa Florio.

At Dieppe, France, on June 26, 1912, Georges Boillot won the French Grand Prix, in his Peugeot L76, a vehicle designed by the young Swiss engineer Ernest Henry in association with Zuccarelli, Goux and Boillot. This was the first motorcar in the world to have an engine with two overhead  camshafts and four valves per cylinder. Boillot won the Coupe de l'Auto in 1913 and became the darling of French racing fans when he won his second straight French Grand Prix at Amiens, becoming the first driver to win it twice.


That same year, his Peugeot teammate, Jules Goux became the first Frenchman to win the Indianapolis 500. The following year, France sent a number of competitors to the Indiana speedway where on May 27, during qualifying, Boillot came tantalizing close to breaking the 100 mile-an-hour (160.92kph) barrier when he set a new speed record of 99.86mph (160.70kph). Much faster than any other driver, Boillot would most likely have won the race with ease had it not been for repeated tire trouble. He ended up finishing 14th while his fellow Frenchmen finished in the top four positions with René Thomas getting the win.

In what would turn out to be his last race, the 1914 French Grand Prix at Lyon, his Peugeot was literally falling apart at the end. After demonstrating his tremendous skills by keeping the vehicle running and near the lead, it finally overheated on the last lap and he was forced to retire.

With the outbreak of World War I, Boillot joined the new French Air Force. He lost his life on April 21, 1916 when his plane was shot down in a dogfight over Verdun-sur-Meuse and crashed near Bar-le-Duc. In his honor, several places in France named a street for him and there is a George Boillot School in Montlhéry in the Essonne département near Paris.

His brother André was also a race driver and at war's end, won the 1919 Targa Florio. Georges' son, Jean, became director-general of Peugeot Talbot cars and in 1981 was responsible for involving Peugeot in rallying.

Mahón is a firm to hard white cheese made from cow's milk, named after the town of Mahón on the island of Minorca off the coast of Spain. Mahón is sweet and fruity but can be slightly salty due to sea salt content in the grasses the cows eat. The rind is generally an orange color due to the rind being rubbed with butter, oil, and paprika. As it reaches maturity (around 10 months) it tends to have small misshapen holes and has some granularity.

<doc id="1438631" title="Touge" nonfiltered="560" processed="553" dbindex="1480565">
 is a Japanese word literally meaning "pass." It refers to a mountain pass or any of the narrow, winding roads that can be found in and around the mountains of Japan and other geographically similar areas. 

Placing a series of turns or bends in the steep roads that provide access to and from the high elevations of the mountains was intended to be a safety measure, usually to prevent commuters from reaching unstable speeds or creating excessive wear on the vehicles associated with them. It is therefore ironic that these same passes have become popular with street racers and motorsport enthusiasts in the last two decades, providing a dangerous and therefore challenging course where nightly competitions are not unheard of.

Racing.
For touge racing team battling, a race has two stages   an uphill and a downhill battle. One car leads the race during the uphill stage, with the second car leading the downhill. Because most touge races feature narrow tracks, overtaking is extremely difficult and is sometimes impossible.

The lead car wins if the space between the cars increases considerably, while the following car wins if the gap between them stays the same, decreases from start to finish or the following car overtakes the lead car. If any car spins out or crashes, the other one wins the race.

Touge races start illegally when one car attempts to overtake another and the car in front will not let the car behind pass and speeds up. Also, in night races, the car behind will flash its headlights and the lead car will then speed up to begin the race.

 Misconceptions .
Stemming from this surge in popularity, the term has been pirated and misused by overzealous enthusiasts (often incorrectly as a verb) to erroneously describe almost any event involving street racing, even when there are no mountain passes involved. 

Another common mistake is the association of drifting with touge, implying at times that the words share a common definition. While drift is considered a style or form of driving, touge does not necessarily have any binding relationship to motorsports.

 Touge in media .

Touge racing's notoriety outside of Japan can be attributed partially to entertainment media such as Initial D (originally manga, and later anime, and in 2005, live action under the Japanese title Tau Man Ji D ), and to a lesser extent, the recent American film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. 

The racing video game Need For Speed Carbon has the "Canyon Duel" which is for all intents and purposes a touge race, except that both stages are done downhill, and a system of "points" is used for clarification.

Touge racing is also popularized in many DVD magazines in Japan and America, now that "drifting" has become accepted by the mainstream, though there may or may not be drifting involved.

<doc id="2048766" title="Iron Monkey (film)" nonfiltered="561" processed="554" dbindex="1480566">






Iron Monkey (Chinese:          ) is the American title of the 1993 Hong Kong Kung fu movie called Siunin Wong Fei-hung tsi titmalau (a literal translation of the title is Young Wong Fei Hung: Iron Monkey), directed by Yuen Woo-ping. The film was given a wide release in America in 2001 by Miramax Films with the backing of director Quentin Tarantino. It received good reviews in America, where it made $14 million.

The film tells a fictionalized account of an episode in the childhood of the Chinese warrior Wong Fei Hung, and his father, Wong Kei Ying (played by Donnie Yen).

It was followed by Iron Monkey 2 in 1996.

 Synopsis .

Set during the Qing Dynasty in 19th Century China, widespread government corruption has hit Zeijing Province particularly hard. Repeated environmental disasters and greedy government officials have starved the ordinary townspeople of their money.

To aid the common people, a hero has arrived: a thief along the lines of Robin Hood or Zorro, who steals from the government and gives the money to the poor. This masked thief, known as Iron Monkey, is regarded as a hero by the townsfolk and a problem by the government. Officials from the capital are repeatedly fired and replaced for being unable to deal with Iron Monkey.

Despite an elaborate trap set for him at the governor's mansion, Iron Monkey, displaying incredible martial arts prowess as he defeats not only the entire militia but the four monk bodyguards of the governor, steals a secret hoard of gold from the governor. 

The townspeople have much faith in their hero   none are worried that new wanted posters for the masked bandit have appeared, and they don't seem to believe that any government official can catch him.

Iron Monkey is actually Dr. Yang, the owner of an herbal medicine clinic called "Pa Cho Tong". Yang is not only an excellent doctor, but a fair one   he overcharges noblemen for their medicine, but gives the same medicine for free to the elderly who suffer from the environmental disasters. He also treats the very soldiers for wounds they received when he was fighting them as the masked warrior, which earns him the devotion of the leader of the militia, Chief Fox, who has become obsessed with catching Iron Monkey. But not knowing his true identity, he sees him everywhere.

Iron Monkey's equal is now introduced: Wong Kei Ying, an itinerant physician who is traveling with his young son, Wong Fei Hung. They plan only to collect some medicine and stay in town for one night, but after getting mugged, Kei Ying gets into a fight with some street thieves. Nearby soldiers, upon watching him display his formidable martial arts skill, believe him to be Iron Monkey and arrest him and his son.

Kei Ying now sees the corruption of the local government firsthand; the soldiers have been arresting anyone remotely related to the monkey, including the owner of a performing monkey, a pharmacist who sells medicine related to the Monkey God, and a street performer who wears face paint to resemble a monkey. They are all now to be fined a huge amount of gold (500 taels), and Kei Ying, upon protesting this injustice, has his son seized.

Young Fei Hung protests, and the governor orders him to be branded for opposing the court. But before the boy's cheek is touched with the branding iron, Iron Monkey appears to disrupt the proceedings. Once again the militia is no match for the thief. Amidst the chaos, however, Wong Kei Ying escapes his capturers and engages the Iron Monkey in combat on the rooftops. It is revealed that the Iron Monkey and Kei Ying are perfect equals in terms of martial arts ability. Iron Monkey only narrowly escapes.

Although the real Iron Monkey has appeared, which proves that none of those arrested is he, the governor arrests Wong Fei Hung, making a deal with Kei Ying: He must capture the Iron Monkey in seven days. He also seizes all of Kei Ying's belongings and money to keep him from abandoning the village.

Wong Kei Ying, who is now stranded in the village, tries to buy some food with his remaining money and discovers, much to his surprise, that the entire village now hates him. Because Wong Kei Ying is attempting to capture Iron Monkey, street vendors refuse to sell their food to him. Hungry and tired, Kei-ying eventually stumbles upon Pa Cho Tong.

After Wong Kei Ying stoops to eat a bun dropped on the ground, Orchid Ho, who is Dr. Yang's assistant, invites him inside for food. Orchid, Yang, and Wong Kei Ying all have dinner together and become good friends. Upon hearing his plight, Yang goes to the city jail to look after Wong Fei Hung. Finding the boy gravely ill from a plague caught from other detainees, Yang convinces Chief Fox to release the boy to his custody.

Wong Kei Ying, meanwhile, is patrolling the rooftops, hoping to catch sight of Iron Monkey. Instead, he encounters four Shaolin monk bodyguards of the governor who had kidnapped a woman with the intention of raping her. Kei Ying then meets the female warrior-witch White Eagle - a follower of the Shaolin rebel Hin-hung, who in a deal with some Qing government officials burned the Shaolin temple in the Fuijan province. Hin-hung is now a powerful government official. Kei Ying and the White Eagle have a brief fight before Eagle escapes.

In a daydream, Orchid's past is revealed. She was previously a prostitute, and upon failed delivery of a child, Dr. Yang bought her from her previous owner. She has been living with him ever since.

In the meantime, a fake official has come, claiming to be the governor's replacement after his failed attempts to capture the Iron Monkey. The fake official is really the Iron Monkey in disguise, there to steal the last of the governor's treasure by tricking him into giving it up as a bribe.

Upon waking up at Pa Cho Tong, Wong Fei Hung steals an urn of medicine - he plans to sell them and buy his and his father's way out of the village. However, he soon meets the same street thieves who fought with his dad at the beginning of the movie. He narrowly defeats them with the help of Orchid and returns to the clinic to be reunited with his father.

The real government official to replace the governor has arrived - the Monk, Hin-hung himself. The four monk bodyguards, White Eagle, and a newcomer, a disfigured warrior named Twin Swords, are all his subordinates.

That night, White Eagle and Twin Swords set a trap to catch the Iron Monkey. He defeats them both, only to be ambushed by Hin-hung and hit with the powerful monk's infamous technique - the "Shaolin King Kong Palm" (also known as the Buddha's Fist), which Hin-hung used to kill everyone in the Shaolin temple upon his betrayal. Fatally bruised, Iron Monkey runs for his life.

Wong Kei Ying intercepts Hin-hung and the two do battle. Hin-hung remarks that Wong Kei Ying's style of fighting deviates from the orthodox version Shaolin kung fu, and he is right - Wong Kei-ying's own style incorporates the "No Shadow Kick" technique, which was developed by the Wong family and would later be made famous by his son, Wong Fei Hung.

Kei Ying is no match for Hin-hung, and is hit by his King Kong Palm as well. He barely escapes, and travels to Pa Cho Tong. There he discovers the Iron Monkey's real identity, but instead of turning him in, he uses his medical knowledge to devise a cure for the Shaolin King Kong Palm. The two recover and decide to try to fight Hin-hung.

Hin-hung has now defeated both Kei Ying and the Iron Monkey. He sets out an order to arrest Wong Kei Ying, branding him a traitor. Knowing that both Kei Ying and Iron Monkey are suffering from his deadly Palm, he orders all soldiers to search every clinic in the city and arrest all the doctors.

One night, as Dr. Yang and Wong Kei-ying are both away, the four monks arrive at the Pa Cho Tong clinic. Finding Orchid, they try to rape her only to find she is also an accomplished master of martial arts. Narrowly defeating her using Ether Powder, they are then defeated by Wong Fei Hung. However, the boy in turn is defeated by White Eagle, who arrests him and brings him to the castle.

Wong Kei Ying and Iron Monkey now storm the government building. With the help of Orchid and Chief Fox, Fei Hung is rescued from being tortured by Hin-hung. Hin-hung, Kei Ying and Iron Monkey now engage in the final confrontation - a fight atop flaming wooden poles. Hin-hung, due to his size, is unable to fight properly on the poles. However, he is still more than a match for both Kei Ying and Iron Monkey. Only with spectacular teamwork are the two able to narrowly defeat the monk. Hin-hung is burned to death and the five refugees escape. 

The end of the movie is left ambiguous - another new official arrives soon enough, and they can only hope that he will be a fair one. Kei Ying now understands the full extent of the corruption in his society, and no longer wishes to hunt down the Iron Monkey. Kei Ying and his son then leave for Fu-shan as originally planned, wishing the best of luck to Dr. Yang.

Reception.
The film opened in the US in October 2001 on 1,225 screens, earning just over $6 million in its opening weekend and more than $14 million overall. It is the 11th-highest-grossing foreign-language films in the US. The film has received favorable reviews from critics, and it has a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Changes to the American version.
In its release in 2001, Miramax made several changes that the company felt would make it more marketable to American audiences. Since most Americans are unfamiliar with the story of Wong Fei Hung, his name was removed from the title. The subtitles were tailored to remove the political context of the story. Some scenes were trimmed to tone down the violence. Also, a new soundtrack was composed that emulated the classical score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but in doing so the famous Wong Fei Hung theme was eliminated.

Margaret Chase Smith (December 14, 1897 May 29, 1995) was a Republican Senator from Maine, and one of the most successful politicians in Maine history. She was the first woman to be elected to both the U.S. House and the Senate. She was also the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for the U.S. Presidency at a major party's convention (1964 Republican Convention, won by Barry Goldwater).  She was a moderate Republican and might be termed a Rockefeller Republican.

Margaret Chase was born in Skowhegan, Maine, on December 14, 1897, the daughter of Carrie Murray and George Emery Chase.  As a young woman she taught school at a one-room schoolhouse, worked as a telephone operator, managed circulation for the Skowhegan Independent Reporter, and served as an executive with a local textile mill.  She became involved with local women's organizations and helped found the Skowhegan Business and Professional Women's Club.  She attended Colby College where she was a member of Sigma Kappa.  In 1930, she married Clyde Smith, a respected political leader in central Maine.

She first won a seat to the U.S. House of Representatives on June 3, 1940 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband. She served on the House Naval Affairs committee during World War II. As co-chair of a subcommittee that investigated problems encountered by the War Department in rapidly establishing bases across the nation, she was instrumental in resolving conflicts between states, local jurisdictions and the military.


She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948. She served in the Senate from 1949 to 1973. In her bid for a third term in 1960, the Democratic Party put up Lucia Cormier, the Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, making it the first time two women ran against each other for a Senate seat.  By the end of her fourth term, the charm she had had for so many years seemed to evaporate. She was defeated for reelection in 1972 by Democrat Bill Hathaway, the only election she ever lost in the state of Maine.  In her last election Smith had been plagued by rumors of poor health (she had been using a motor scooter around the Senate). A Republican primary challenger taunted her for being out of touch; she did not have a state office operating in Maine. Also, she alienated liberals with her support for the Vietnam War while turning off conservatives with her votes against Nixon Supreme Court nominees Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell.

Senator Smith had a professional and personal relationship with staff assistant William Lewis, a lawyer from Oklahoma with a Harvard MBA. He had been assigned to work with the House Naval Affairs committee while with the Naval Reserve. His political and legal savvy combined with his knowledge of military matters augmented her own experience. He remained her political advisor and personal partner until his death in 1982.

She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush in 1989 in addition to the U.S. Air Force's top award, the American Spirit Award, in recognition of her contributions as a "great American patriot".  She was also presented with a Doctor of Laws honorary degree from Rutgers University in addition to 93 other honorary degrees. She attended Colby College and was a member of Sigma Kappa sorority.

Senator Smith is prominent not only for her many firsts as a woman, but also for her early principled opposition to the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy.  On June 1, 1950, she gave her Declaration of Conscience  speech on the floor of the Senate, earning McCarthy's permanent ire and the nickname "Moscow Maggie" from his staff.  In 1954, when McCarthy attempted to challenge her seat by sponsoring a primary challenger, the Maine voters rejected the effort. She was the first (and as yet only) woman chair of the Senate Republican Conference, 1967 1972.

Janis Benson portrayed Senator Smith in the 1998 miniseries From the Earth to the Moon.

Patricia Neal dramatized Senator Smith's Declaration of Conscience speech in the 1978 television movie Tail Gunner Joe.

<doc id="8549289" title="Richwood Area Community Hospital" nonfiltered="564" processed="557" dbindex="1480569">


Richwood Area Community Hospital (RACH) is a hospital located in Richwood that serves the city and several surrounding communities.  RACH was known as Sacred Heart Hospital when it opened in 1954. The hospital later changed its name to Richwood Area Medical Center when it was purchased by Charleston Area Medical Center. The hospital adopted its current name when CAMC sold the hospital to a community consortium. RACH is assisted by two of West Virginia's largest hospitals, CAMC and Raleigh General Hospital in Beckley for more serious injuries. For health concerns that are not life-threatening but cannot be treated at RACH, patients are sent to nearby Summersville Memorial Hospital in Summersville.

Since its establishment in 1954 as a Catholic Hospital and changing to a public facility, RACH has grown smaller along with the area's shrinking population and dwindling workforce. With less patients to care for the hospital has been undergoing some changes in how to provide the best and most efficent healthcare it possibly can even during its hard times. In early 2002 the hospital joined with Charleston's main hospital to provide the new technology of allowing patients to see a doctor in Charleston without having to travel the long distance to the hospital. For most minor issues the implication was fairly successful. Another trial that has proved costly for the hospital has been the housing of elderly care patients from the overflowing nursing home nearby. Two and a half floors of RACH are dedicated to elderly patient care which has waved confidence in potential patients for using RACH as their stop for healthcare as many assume the hospital will lack in provided care to the young adults and childern due to its high population of elderly patients. 

In 2005 the hospital with donations and funding from the state and the hospital itself paved way for a much needed helipad to help in the shipment of patients to Charleston, West Virginia, Beckley, and even Morgantown's Ruby Memorial Hospital. The helipad was a much needed addition to the aging hospital's need to provide better care. The hospital is right now in the process of a fundraising campaign to help purchase state of the art medical treament equipment to begin treating new cases and to improve treatment of current cases that are able to be treated within the hospital

Clinic.
In 2004 the hospital took the route to help improve the health and well being of patients who cannot afford health care. In the spring of 2004 the hospital opened the Rural Health Clinic which is located on the 4th floor of the hospital providing health care to those in need or who cannot afford the high costs of seeing a private doctor. The clinic has proved to be successful, but has not been the moneymaker that the hospital needs to improve facilities and to offer more treatments and options for those in need.

Facilities.
The hospital is one of the tallest buildings within Nicholas County standing with 5 floors. The hospital in its prime was one of the best outfitted facilities in eastern West Virginia serving the rural areas of Nicholas, northern Greenbrier, Pocahontas, and Webster counties. Since then the building has deterorated and in need of much needed upgrades. The 50 year old structure has not been improved in years the last being the update to the 4th floor for the clinic and the emergency room area being reworked to better treatments. There have been rumors that the hospital is in the works to build a new state of the art facility within Richwood, but nothing has came to light if and when this will start. The hospital still has one of the highest amount of beds available to patient care within Nicholas County only trailing Summersville Memorial Hospital by only a few beds. The hospital still has therepy on site along with X-Ray. The hospital still has the space for bringing back surgery and Obstetrics & Gynecology. There are still rumors circulating that Obstetrics & Gynecology will return to RACH and would be a much needed addition to the facility if it wants to remain competitive.

Arash Farboud is an Iranian entrepeneur. 

 History .
Arash Farboud attended St. Faith's and then The Perse School, Cambridge. He founded a company making exotic British automobiles in 1998. The original car building was prompted by the refusal by Porsche GmbH to sell Arash Farboud a GT1 Road Car. The Porsche 911 GT1 had just swept to victory in the 24 hours of Le Mans, but road cars were by invitation only. Only 5 road going GT1s were made and used, ironically, mostly for racing, with one saved for the Porsche Museum. The sale of the Farboud family business, specialising in sterile medical supplies provided the funds; and the snub by Porsche provided the reason d'etre. Arash Farboud continues to run the family's property, land, investments and other medical businesses that were not sold. He is still very involved with Farboud Sports Cars and is currently working with the team in Bristol; as well as working on his new range of supercars badged 'Arash Cars' including his AF10 and racing car projects. Arash is renowned for his collection of supercars from Lamborghinis to a rare Carrera GT specially made for him in Germany by Porsche.

 The GT and GTS .
Main Article: Farboud GTS

Thus the first Farboud, the GT, was formed in the visage of the '96-'9 Porsche 911 GT1, powered by a twin-turbo v6 derived from the Audi S4. Porsche complained about the styling but only one vehicle was made and never sold on the open market. The Farboud GT turned up at the start of the 2005 Gumball 3000 rally in London as a star vehicle and continues to make appearances in the UK. Arash turned his mind to a more marketable car and hired a stylist fresh out of school to help him develop a compact supercar formed around the same drivetrain. 

The resulting prototype, the GTS, was a compact car with a steel tube-frame with carbon fibre body panels, pushrod suspension with Öhlins dampers, and with power expected to be available up to 580 hp at production. The GTS was roundly received as a stunning car, mostly revered for its looks and expected to perform up to the promise of the body, even if at a cost. Link to Evo Pictures

 Farboud Sports Cars .
The farboud supercar company was started in 2004.
It is believed the GTS was too big of a project for so small and expensive a team (Farboud had hired ex-MTM engine tuners and ex-Lotus chassis engineers), and Chris Marsh was asked by Arash Farboud in 2004 to take the reins of daily running of the company so Arash could concentrate on supercar projects, racing, and his other family business commitments. Marsh had experience working on the Marcos and Invicta British Sports cars, and was especially attracted to the Farboud for the unusually warm public reception to its looks, and was excited about how to bring the GTS to market profitably.

With the aim of maintaining the looks of the GTS and the expected performance, Marsh is rumored to have addressed some sore points, such as the low windshield header (higher for production with the profile maintained), the partially obscured rear window (original GTS had a decorative vent right in the middle), the expensive pushrod suspension (now seen to be upright coilovers positioned nearly vertically above the control arms), the expensive Öhlins dampers, and most disruptively, replacing the defunct audi-derived longitudinal turbocharged engine(s) with transversely positioned naturally aspirated and supercharged, cosworth-tuned Ford v6's based on the current Duratec found in Mondeos, Escapes and Five Hundreds. 

Farboud Sports Cars is currently finalising production of the Farboud GTS as of Summer 2006. The marque of the company is a yellow bow and arrow taken from the character Arash, an archer from Persian mythology. The mark is a lucky charm that Arash wished to use after learning stories about the mythical character as a child.

Farboud exportation for the USA will be based in Miami, Florida. Farboud plans to have 50 GTS cars for export to the USA when production models are complete by 2006. 
Farboud also hopes to export 20 GTS cars to Japan once a final production model is complete.
On-road production for the GTS is on track to be completed in late Summer of 2006.
The suggested price of the GTS so far listed is £48,175.

The Farboud GTS is featured in the Xbox 360 game: Project Gotham Racing 3and Test drive Unlimited.

 Arash Cars .
Arash Farboud, unhappy to see the planned GTS (Öhlins pushrod suspension, longitudinal 2.8L twin-turbo Audi-derived v6) so watered down from his original concept of a road-going racecar has formed a separate company, Arash Cars . In mid-2006 Arash published sketches for their new car, the Arash AF10. Based on the graphics released, the car looks similar to the Enzo Ferrari, but powered by a Corvette V8 engine. The AF10 is priced at £170,000 apiece, about 1/3rd of the Enzo's list price. Although the original sketches have been compared to the Enzo, a mock up of the proposed shape showed an evolution away from the sketches in order to compensate for door openings and the result of wind tunnel testing for air vents. The wheel base has also been extended after a secret running prototype had revealed a better stability at higher speeds. (Source - speaking directly to the factory)

AF10 is now being designed and assembled at his Cambridge facilities, with a close knit team able to make the car exactly as he wishes. Although the car is not likely produced in high volumes, it will cater for a small number of customers and loyal followers of his work for the next few years.

Dr. Joseph 'Joe' Ransohoff, II (July 1, 1915- January 30, 2001) was a pioneer in the field of neurosurgery. In addition to training numerous neurosurgeons, his "ingenuity in adapting advanced technologies" saved many lives and even influenced a television program, Ben Casey.  Among other innovations, he created the first intensive care unit dedicated to neurosurgery, and helped define the fields of pediatric neurosurgery and neuroradiology. 

 Early Life and Education.

Ransohoff was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, son of Dr. Joseph Louis Ransohoff II, a surgeon who himself was the son of a surgeon. He received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University, although while attending Harvard he seriously considered dropping out in order to participate in the Spanish Civil War, due to his Communist sympathies. A favorite boast of his was that he was the only student in the history of the University to graduate on parole. He received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1941 and went on to become a surgery instructor at the University of Cincinnati. Three years into his residency, he was drafted into the United States Army where he was taught neurosurgery,  and  after seeing action at the Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, and personally befriending General George S. Patton, was assigned to air evacuation centers in France and Germany.

 Fame and Death.

After three years in the military, he completed his residency at Montefiore Hospital. He went on to teach at Columbia University and practice surgery at the New York Neurologic Institute at Presbyterian Hospital before moving to New York University School of Medicine to become chairman of its neurosurgery department in 1962, holding this prestigious position for 30 years. While in this capacity, Ransohoff was famed for hosting a weekly spinal and neurosurgical gathering for doctors of the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to come and seek his advice on challenging cases.

In 1992, Dr. Ransohoff left Manhattan for Tampa, Florida, at the behest of the VA Hospital, which wanted to reform it's neurosurgical department. After improving the neurosurgical and spinal centers at the VA Hospital and Tampa General Hospital, and adding greatly to the brain cancer research programs at Moffitt Cancer Center, Dr. Ransohoff died at his home on the morning of January 3rd, 2001, at the age of 85.

 Legacy and Influence .

The book Brain Surgeon: An Intimate View of His World (ISBN 0-8041-0957-5) by Lawrence Shainberg was based on his life. He also served as a consultant to the popular television series Ben Casey and some viewers familiar with Dr. Ransohoff feel that Casey and Ransohoff have similar personalities.

The 1973 Formula One Swedish Grand Prix was held at the Scandinavian Raceway on June 17, 1973.


Ronnie Peterson's success with Team Lotus was the catalyst for a Swedish Grand Prix and the race was held for the first time in 1973 at the grandly-named Scandinavian Raceway.

Peterson did not disappoint his fans in qualifying, taking pole in his Lotus.

For 70 laps it looked like this was going to be a one-two for Team Lotus with Peterson first and world champion Emerson Fittipaldi second. However disaster struck when Fittipaldi retired with gearbox failure. Meanwhile, Denny Hulme was quickly closing the gap on the lead, Peterson having major trouble with tire wear and fighting to stay on the track.

On the 79th and penultimate lap Hulme was able to pass the local hero to snatch victory, the New Zealander's decision to run harder tires on his McLaren-Cosworth having paid off. Peterson was second. That was as close as any Swede came to winning on home soil.

It is worth noting that during the 1973 season, the Cosworth DFV V8 engine powered to victory in every single race in the 15 race season, a performance never to be repeated.

<doc id="1119465" title="USS Kalk (DD-170)" nonfiltered="575" processed="568" dbindex="1480580">


The first USS Kalk (DD 170) was a Wickes class destroyer in the United States Navy during the World War I, later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Hamilton (I-24) and then into the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Hamilton (I-24).

As USS Kalk.

Named for Stanton Frederick Kalk, Kalk, laid down as Rodgers 4 March 1917, was launched 21 December 1918, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. Flora Stanton Kalk, mother of Lieutenant Kalk; renamed Kalk 23 December 1918; and commissioned at Boston 29 March 1919, Lieutenant Commander N. R. Van der Veer in command.

After shakedown off Newport, Kalk departed Boston 3 May for Newfoundland. Arriving Trespassey 5 May, she sailed 3 days later for the mid-Atlantic to provide rescue cover during the pioneer flight of Navy seaplane NC-4 from Newfoundland to the Azores 16 to 17 May. After returning to Boston 20 May, she sailed for Europe 10 July, arriving Brest, France, 21 July. Proceeding via England to Hamburg, Germany, she arrived 27 July to begin a 3-week cruise through the Baltic Sea, visiting Baltic and Scandinavian countries on American Relief Administration operations. She returned to Brest 23 August to serve as a dispatch and escort ship until departing for the United States 25 January 1920. 

Arriving Boston 12 February, she trained reserves of the 1st Naval District and operated with DesRon 3 along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to Charleston. As a result of the Five Power Naval Treaty, which was signed at the Washington Conference 6 February 1922, Kalk departed Boston 10 May for Philadelphia, where she decommissioned 10 July and was placed in reserve. 

When war in Europe threatened the security of the entire world, Kalk recommissioned 17 June 1940, Lt. T. P. Elliott in command. Departing Philadelphia 26 July, she arrived Charleston the 31st for duty with the Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic. Kalk was one of 50 overage 4-pipers turned over to Britain in exchange for strategic bases in the Atlantic under terms of the "Destroyers for Bases Agreement" of 2 September. She cleared Charleston 7 September and steamed via Hampton Roads and Newport to Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving 18 September. Kalk decommissioned 23 September and was turned over to the British the same day.

See USS Kalk for other ships of this name.

As HMS Hamilton and HMCS Hamilton.

Commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Hamilton, she collided with HMS Georgetown (formerly Maddox, DD-168) at St. John's, Newfoundland, 1 October while en route to England. Proceeding to Saint John, New Brunswick, for repairs, she went aground and suffered extensive damage. Because of a British manpower shortage, she was manned by Canadians during and after repair operations; late in June 1941 she commissioned in the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Hamilton. 

Throughout her active service, she remained in North American waters, protecting convoys from St. John's to New York. On 2 August 1942, she sighted and attacked a German U-boat and, by forcing it to submerge, prevented an attack on the convoy. Declared unfit for operations 11 August 1943, she became a tender to HMCS Cornwallis at Annapolis, Nova Scotia. Declared surplus 1 April 1945, she decommissioned 8 June at Sydney, Nova Scotia. HMCS Hamilton departed Sydney 6 July under tow for Baltimore, Maryland, where she was scrapped by the Boston Iron & Metal Company.

<doc id="7355278" title="Möbius ladder" nonfiltered="576" processed="569" dbindex="1480581">

In the mathematical area of graph theory, the Möbius ladder Mn is a cubic circulant graph with an even number n of vertices, formed from an n-cycle by adding edges (called "rungs") connecting opposite pairs of vertices in the cycle. It is so-named because (with the exception of M6 = K3,3) Mn has exactly n/2 4-cycles (McSorley 1998) which link together by their shared edges to form a topological Möbius strip. Möbius ladders were named and first studied by Guy and Harary (1967).

 Properties .

Every Möbius ladder is nonplanar. Möbius ladders have crossing number one, and can be embedded without crossings on a torus or projective plane. Li (2005) explores embeddings of these graphs onto higher genus surfaces.

Möbius ladders are vertex-transitive but (again with the exception of M6) not edge-transitive: each edge from the cycle from which the ladder is formed belongs to a single 4-cycle, while each rung belongs to two such cycles.

When n   2 (mod 4), Mn is bipartite. When n   0 (mod 4), by Brooks' theorem Mn has chromatic number 3. De Mier and Noy (2005) show that the Möbius ladders are uniquely determined by their chromatic polynomials.

The Möbius ladder M8 has 392 spanning trees; it and M6 have the most spanning trees among all cubic graphs with the same number of vertices (Jakobson and Rivin 1999; Valdes 1991). However, the 10-vertex graph with the most spanning trees is the Petersen graph, which is not a Möbius ladder.

 Graph minors .

Möbius ladders play an important role in the theory of graph minors. The earliest result of this type is a theorem of Wagner (1937) that graphs with no K5 minor can be formed by simple operations that combine planar graphs and the Möbius ladder M8; for this reason M8 is sometimes called the Wagner graph.

Gubser (1996) defines an almost-planar graph to be a nonplanar graph for which every nontrivial minor is planar; he shows that 3-connected almost-planar graphs are Möbius ladders or members of a small number of other families, and that other almost-planar graphs can be formed from these by a sequence of simple operations.

Maharry (2001) shows that almost all graphs that do not have a cube minor can be derived by a sequence of simple operations from Möbius ladders.

 Chemistry and Physics .

Walba et al (1982) first synthesized molecular structures in the form of a Möbius ladder, and since then this structure has been of interest in chemistry and chemical stereography (Simon 1993), especially in view of the ladder-like form of DNA molecules. With this application in mind, Flapan (1989) studies the mathematical symmetries of embeddings of Möbius ladders in R3.

Möbius ladders have also been used as the shape of a superconducting ring in experiments to study the effects of conductor topology on electron interactions (Mila et al 1998; Deng et al 2002).

 Combinatorial optimization .

Möbius ladders have also been used in computer science, as part of integer programming approaches to problems of set packing and linear ordering. Certain configurations within these problems can be used to define facets of the polytope describing a linear programming relaxation of the problem; these facets are called Möbius ladder constraints (Bolotashvili et al 1999; Borndörfer and Weismantel 2000; Grötschel et al 1985a, 1985b; Newman and Vempala 2004).

<doc id="2730366" title="Esperanto and Ido compared" nonfiltered="578" processed="571" dbindex="1480583">

This article attempts to highlight the main differences between Esperanto and Ido, two constructed languages that have a related past but have since parted ways. Ido was invented in the early 20th century after a schism between those who believed that Esperanto had inherent flaws that prevented it from being a suitable international auxiliary language, and those who believed that Esperanto was sufficient as it was, and that endless tinkering with a language would only weaken it in the end. For information on the languages themselves, see the links above.

The languages remain close, and to some extent mutually intelligible. An Italian play which was written with the dialog in two dialects of Italian was translated with Esperanto and Ido representing these two dialects. In the same manner in which dialects often serve as sources for new words through the literature of ethnic languages, so Ido has contributed many neologisms to Esperanto (especially in poetic substitutes for long words using the mal- prefix).

Linguistic comparison.
Esperanto is based on the Fundamento de Esperanto by L. L. Zamenhof, whereas the grammar of Ido is explained in the Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido.

Morphology.
Morphology is where one of the largest differences between the two languages can be seen. Both languages have the same grammatical rules concerning nouns (ending with -o), adjectives (ending with -a) and many other aspects. However, the relationship between nouns, verbs and adjectives underwent a number of changes with Ido, based on the principle of reversibility. In both languages one can see a direct relationship between the words multa "many" and multo "a multitude" by simply replacing the adjectival -a with a nominal -o, or the other way around. 

Some minor differences include the loss of adjectival agreement, and the change of the plural from an agglutinative -j tacked onto the end to a synthetic replacement of the terminal -o with an -i. Hence, Esperanto belaj hundoj ("beautiful dogs") becomes Ido bela hundi. Ido also does away with the direct object ending -n in sentences where the subject precedes the object, so Esperanto mi amas la belajn hundojn ("I love the beautiful dogs") would in Ido become me amas la bela hundi.

However, Esperantists claim that the Esperanto adjective / noun agreement makes possible greater freedom of word order and somewhat greater redundancy. English and Esperanto actually have about the same amount of redundancy here , English because of its third-person verb conjugation and Esperanto because of noun-adjective agreement; Ido, which has neither, does not have that redundancy. 

Greater differences arise, however, with the derivations of many words. For example, in Esperanto, the noun krono means "a crown", and by replacing the nominal o with a verbal i one derives the verb kroni "to crown". However, if one were to begin with the verb kroni, "to crown", and replace the verbal i with a nominal o to create a noun, the resulting meaning would not be "a coronation", but rather the original "crown". This is because the root kron- is inherently a noun: With the nominal ending -o the word simply means the thing itself, whereas with the verbal -i it means an action performed with the thing. To get the name for the performance of the action, it is necessary to use the suffix -ado, which retains the verbal idea. Thus it is necessary to know which part of speech each Esperanto root belongs to. 

Ido introduced a number of suffixes in an attempt to clarify the morphology of a given word, so that the part of speech of the root would not need to be memorized. In the case of the word krono "a crown", the suffix -izar "to cover with" is added to create the verb kronizar "to crown". From this verb it is possible to remove the verbal -ar and replace it with a nominal -o, creating the word kronizo "a coronation". By not allowing a noun to be used directly as a verb, as in Esperanto, Ido verbal roots can be recognized without the need to memorize them. 

However, this solution is only partial, and with other derivations it is still necessary to know the parts of speech of Ido roots. The main difference is that Ido corresponds more overtly to the expectations of the Romance languages, whereas Esperanto is more heavily influenced by Slavic semantics. This aspect of Esperanto had been simply assumed by its inventor, and had not been made explicit when Ido was created.

Vocabulary.
Although both Esperanto and Ido share a large amount of the same vocabulary, there are many important differences. Ido uses the twenty-six letter Latin alphabet in its entirety without any special characters or diacritics. Conversely, Esperanto eliminates the "unnecessary" letters "q", "w", "x", and "y"; and adds "[[ ]]", "[[ ]]", "[[ ]], "[[ ]]", "[[ ]]" and "[[ ]]". Aside from these minor spelling differences, Ido aims to correct what were perceived as deficiencies in Esperanto.

However, Ido lacks the one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes that Esperanto has, using the three digraphs qu, sh and ch. One-to-one correspondence has been used by almost all planned languages to ease the learning. Esperanto speakers, however, are allowed to use "cx", "gx", "hx, "jx", "sx" and "ux" as digraphs, by the Fundamento, although they prefer not to when they can avoid it. Dr Zamenhof used "ch", "gh", "hh", "jh", "sh", and "u".  It was the advent of computers that substituted the letter "x" since it does not exist in Esperanto.

Internationality.
The creators of Ido felt that much of Esperanto was either not internationally recognizable, or unnecessarily deformed. Ido aims to fix these with more "international" or "corrected" roots. This can sometimes be at the expense of Esperanto's simplified word building process. Below are some examples in first Esperanto then Ido with English, French,  German, Italian and Spanish for linguistic comparison:



Note that four of the languages chosen in this chart are romance languages and that English has also had large influences from French and Latin. In comparison, Esperanto is somewhat more influenced by German vocabulary and Slavic semantics and has more priority over word compounding by affixes.

Affixes.
Ido claims the prefix mal- (creating a word with the exact opposite meaning) in Esperanto to be overused as a prefix, and also that it can be inappropriate since it has negative meanings in many languages, and proposes des- as an alternative in some cases. Ido also uses a series of opposite words in lieu of a prefix. For example, instead of malbona ("bad", the opposite of bona, "good"), Ido uses mala, or instead of mallonga ("short", the opposite of longa, "long"), kurta. Listening comprehension was also given as a reason: the primary Ido grammar book states that one reason for the adoption of the Latin-based sinistra for "left" instead of maldextra (mal- plus the word dextra, or dekstra for "right") is that often only the last one or two syllables can be heard when shouting commands. 

Ido does not assume male gender in a word. For example, frato means "brother" in Esperanto, but "sibling" in Ido. Ido uses the suffixes -ino ("female", used as in Esperanto) and -ulo ("male", not to be confused with the same Esperanto suffix which means "person"). Thus "sister" would be fratino (the same as Esperanto), but brother, fratulo . Some groups use three separate words: patro ("father"), matro ("mother") and genitoro ("parent"). Compare this with Esperanto patro, patrino and gepatroj respectively. The last is especially difficult in Esperanto, since the prefix ge- means "both genders together" and is inherently plural, thus rendering "parents" instead of "parent". One might say unu el la gepatroj, "one (out) of the parents". There is however a non official suffix in Esperanto that means "male": -i o- (see "Gender").

Correlatives.
Ido does not use the regularized table of correlatives as Esperanto, but uses Latin-derived roots, so Esperanto, kio equals Ido quo, "what"; Esperanto tie, equals Ido ibe, "there", etc.

Proper nouns.
Esperanto may or may not "Esperantize" names and proper nouns, depending on many factors. Most standard European names have equivalents, as do many major cities and all nations. Ido, on the other hand, treats most proper nouns as foreign words, and does not render them into Ido.

Personal names.
As stated above, most European given names have Esperanto equivalents: "John" is Johano, "Alexander" is Aleksandro, etc. Because some cultures place the surname first before the given name and others last after it, it is the practice of some Esperanto writers to give surnames in all capital letters, although it is unusual to find this in publications. "John Smith" would thus be rendered "John SMITH" or "Johano SMITH" in the first mention. Most non-Western names do not have equivalents and are rendered as close as possible in Esperanto orthography.

Ido, on the other hand, simply leaves the names as is; "John Smith" would be "John Smith" in Ido. Names from languages with non-Latin scripts are rendered as phonetically as possible. Ido does not capitalize surnames.

Place names.
Most countries have their own names in Esperanto. The system of derivation, though, is sometimes complex. In Old World nations, where the country is named after an ethnic group, the main root means a person of that group: anglo is an Englishman, franco is a Frenchman. Originally, names of nations were created by the addition of the suffix -ujo (container), hence England and France would be rendered Anglujo and Francujo respectively (literally, "a container full of Englishmen/Frenchmen"). More recently, Esperanto has adopted -io as the national suffix, thus creating names more inline with standard international practice (and less odd-looking): Anglio, Francio. 

In the New World, where citizens are named for their nation, the name of the nation is the main word, and its inhabitants are derived from that: Kanado ("Canada"), kanadano ("Canadian").

Names of cities may or may not have an Esperanto equivalent: Londono for London, Nov-Jorko for New York. Place names which lack wide-spread recognition, or which would be mangled beyond recognition usually remain in their native form: Cannes is usually rendered as "Cannes".

In Ido, country names must conform to the language's orthography but otherwise are left unchanged: Europa, Peru, Amerika. City names are treated as foreign words (London), except when part of the name itself is a regular noun or adjective: Nov-York (Nov for nova, or "new", but the place name York is not changed as in Esperanto "Nov-Jorko"). This is not a hard and fast rule, however, and New York is also acceptable, similar to writing Köln for the city of Cologne in Germany. South Carolina becomes Sud-Karolina, much in the same way that a river called the "Schwarz River" is not transcribed as the "Black River" in English even though schwarz is the German word for black. However, less well-known place names are generally left alone, so a small town by the name of "Battle River" for example would be written the same way, and not transcribed as "Batalio-rivero". This is because transcribing a little-known place name would make it nearly impossible to find in the original language.

Number of speakers.
The most reliable estimate for the number of Esperanto speakers is around 1.6 million, though estimates vary widely. In the same manner estimates for the number of Ido speakers are far from accurate, but 500 to a few thousand is most likely. It is also important to note the distinction between the number of speakers compared to the number of supporters; the two languages resemble each other enough that a few weeks of study will enable one to understand the other with little difficulty, and there are a number of people that have learned Ido out of curiosity but prefer to support the larger Esperanto movement and vice versa.
The number of participants at the respective international conferences is also much different: Esperanto conferences average 2000 to 3000 participants every year whereas Ido conferences have had  anywhere from 13 to 25 participants over the last decade. Each language also has a number of regional conferences during the year on a much less formal basis, and with smaller numbers.

History.
This section attempts to chronicle the history of the Esperanto and Ido movements in relationship to one another. For individual histories of the languages, please see: History of Esperanto and History of Ido.;
The history  of Esperanto and its relationship to Ido is one filled with perceived rivalry and betrayal as well as a good amount of misunderstanding. Many Esperantists have felt betrayed by the Ido movement, and many Idists feel their language doesn't get the respect it deserves.

In 1900 Louis Couturat, after initial correspondences with Esperanto-founder L. L. Zamenhof created the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. In 1907 in Vienna, the Delegation met to chose an international auxiliary language to give its approval from among the many candidates which had crept up. Most Esperantists assumed Esperanto would be an easy win. However, when Couturat presented his own pet project, a series of reforms to Esperanto which would eventually become Ido, and demanded an answer within a month, many in the Esperanto movement felt betrayed. Some Esperantists even accuse Couturat and his colleague Marquis Louis de Beaufront of a conspiracy saying the International Delegation was simply a front to put forth Ido.

Idists tend to see things differently. They note that many of the changes Ido made to Esperanto were those originally proposed by Zamenhof's Reformed Esperanto, which were ultimately rejected by the majority of the language's speakers. Idists perceived that Esperanto was flawed in many ways, and that rather than a conspiracy against the language, the proposals put forward by Courutat were simply improvements which were sorely needed.

A rudder is a device used to steer ships, boats, submarines, aircraft, hovercraft or other conveyances that move through air or water. Rudders operate by re-directing the flow of air or water past the hull or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft's stern, tail or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a tiller essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm may be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be steered by a helmsman. In larger vessels, cables, pushrods and hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, pedals operate rudders via mechanical linkages.

History of the rudder.

Early history.
Oars mounted on the side of ships for steering are documented from the 3rd millennium BCE in Ancient Egypt in artwork, wooden models, and even remnants of actual boats. An early example of an oar mounted on the stern is found in the Egyptian tomb of Menna (1422-1411 BC). Stern mounted oars were also quite common in Roman times as proved from contemporary depictions.

China.

The world's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted rudder can be seen on a pottery model of a Chinese junk dating from the 1st century CE, predating their appearance in the West by a thousand years. The Chinese stern-mounted rudder is hung from the stern, held in place and controlled with a rope mechanism.  Also, many junks incorporated "fenestrated rudders" (rudders with holes in them, allowing for better control), an innovation adopted in the West in 1901 to increase the manoeuvrability of torpedo boats. Detailed descriptions of Chinese junks during the Middle Ages are known from various travellers to China, such as Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo. 

Europe.
Oars mounted on the side of ships evolved into quarter rudders, which were used in Antiquity until the end of the Middle Ages in Europe. As the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased, quarter-rudders became unwieldy and were replaced in Europe by the more sturdy stern-mounted rudders with pintle and gudgeon attachment from the 12th century. The West's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted rudder can be found on church carvings dating to around 1180. 

All evidence indicates that the European stern-mounted rudder, whose technical specifications considerably differ from the Chinese one, was invented independently:

 The only actual concept which can be claimed to have been transmitted from the Chinese is the idea of a stern-mounted rudder, and not its method of attachment nor the manner in which it was controlled. Since that idea of putting a rudder on the stern can be traced back to the models found in Egyptian tombs, the need to have the concept brought into the Middle East is questionable at best. There is no evidence to support the contention that the sternpost-mounted rudder came from China, and no need to call on exterior sources for its introduction into the Mediterranean.;

Arabs.
The Arabs also used a sternpost-mounted rudder which differed technically from both its European and Chinese counterparts. On their ships "the rudder is controlled by two lines, each attached to a crosspiece mounted on the rudder head perpendicular to the plane of the rudder blade." The earliest evidence comes from the Ahsan al-Taqasim fi Marifat al-Aqalim ('The Best Divisions for the Classification of Regions') written by al-Muqaddasi in 985:

 The captain from the crow's nest carefully observes the sea. When a rock is espied, he shouts: "Starboard!" or 'Port!" Two youths, posted there, repeat the cry. The helmsman, with two ropes in his hand, when he hears the calls tugs one or the other to the right or left. If great care is not taken, the ship strikes the rocks and is wrecked.;

Technical details.
Boat rudders may be either outboard or inboard. Outboard rudders are hung on the stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit. 

Some sailors use rudder post and mast placement to define the difference between a ketch and a yawl, similar two-masted vessels. Yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft (ie. "aft of") the rudder post; ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post.

Small boat rudders that can be steered more or less perpendicular to the hull's longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed "hard over." However, terms such as "hard over," "hard to starboard," etc. signify a maximum-rate turn for larger vessels.

Aircraft rudders.

 

On an aircraft, the rudder is called a "control surface" along with the rudder-like elevator (attached to horizontal tail structure) and ailerons (attached to the wings) that control pitch and roll.  The rudder is usually attached to the fin (or vertical stabilizer) which allows the pilot to control yaw in the horizontal axis, ie change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing.  The rudder's direction is manipulated with the movement of foot pedals by the pilot.  

In practice, both aileron and rudder control input are used together to turn an aircraft, the ailerons imparting roll, the rudder imparting yaw, and also compensating for a phenomenon called adverse yaw. Adverse yaw is readily seen if the ailerons alone are used for a turn. The downward moving aileron acts like a flap, generating more lift for one wing, and therefore more drag. Initially, this drag yaws the aircraft in the direction opposite to the desired course. A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed wing aircraft, but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction.  Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is in line with the arc of the turn, neither slipping (under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered). Improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a spin which can be dangerous at low altitudes.

Sometimes pilots may intentionally operate the rudder and ailerons in opposite directions in a maneuver called a forward slip. This may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage in line with the runway, or to more rapidly lose altitude by increasing drag, or both.

The serratus anterior is a muscle that originates on the surface of the upper eight ribs at the side of the chest and inserts along the entire anterior length of the medial border of the scapula.

Function.
The serratus anterior is occasionally called the "boxer's muscle" because it is largely responsible for the protraction of the scapula--that is, the pulling of the scapula forward and around the rib cage that occurs when someone throws a punch.  The serratus anterior also helps to stabilizes the scapula.  In addition, it assists in rotating the scapula (glenoid fossa) upward.

Innervation.
The serratus anterior is innervated by the long thoracic nerve, a branch of the brachial plexus.  The long thoracic nerve travels inferiorly on the surface of the serratus.  The nerve is especially vulnerable during certain types of surgery (for example, during lymph node clearance from the axilla). See winged scapula for more details.

The vas deferens (plural: vasa deferentia), also called ductus deferens, (Latin: "carrying-away vessel") is part of the male anatomy of some species, including humans. 

Structure.
There are two such ducts; they are muscular tubes (surrounded by smooth muscle) connecting the left and right epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in order to move sperm. Each tube is about 30 centimeters long. 

They are part of the spermatic cords.

Function in ejaculation.
During ejaculation the smooth muscle in the wall of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, thus propelling the sperm forward. The sperm are transferred from the ductus deferens into the urethra, collecting fluids from the male accessory sex glands en route.

Significance in contraception.
The procedure of deferentectomy, popularly known as a vasectomy, is a method of contraception in which the vasa deferentia (Latin plural) are permanently cut, though in some cases it can be reversed. A modern variation, which is also popularly known as a vasectomy even though it does not include cutting the vas, involves injecting an obstructive material into the ductus to block the flow of sperm.

Blood supply.
The Vas deferens is mainly supplied by a artery accompanying it (artery of vas deferens).  This artery normally arise from either the superior vesical artery or the inferior vesical artery.  Both these arteries arose from the internal iliac artery.

The Rufous-browed Peppershrike, Cyclarhis gujanensis, is a passerine bird in the vireo family.

It breeds in open woodland and cultivation with some tall trees from Mexico and Trinidad south to  Argentina and Uruguay.

The nest is a flimsy cup high in a tree with a typical clutch of two or three pinkish-white eggs lightly blotched with brown. 

The adult Rufous-browed Peppershrike is 15cm long and weighs 28g. It is bull-headed with a shrike-like bill. The head is grey with a strong rufous eyebrow.. The upperparts are green, and the yellow throat and breast shade into a white belly. Southern forms are darker with a narrower eyebrow.

The song is a whistled phrase with the rhythm Do you wash every week?, but each bird has individual variations. It is often heard but hard to see as it feeds on insects and spiders high in the foliage.

Saint Joseph Oriol (José Orioli) (November 23, 1650 March 23, 1702) is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church.  He is called the "Thaumaturgus of Barcelona."  A native of Barcelona, he studied in the University of Barcelona, receiving the degree of Doctor of Theology, 1 August, 1674. 

He was ordained priest on 30 May, 1676.  He visited Rome in 1686 and was granted a benefice in the church of Nuestra Señora del Pino, in Barcelona. 

Impelled by a desire of martyrdom, he went to Rome in April, 1698, to offer himself for the foreign missions, but, falling sick at Marseilles, he returned to Barcelona. He was said to have prophetic and miraculous powers. The dying, the blind, the deaf and dumb, the lame, and the paralytic, were said to be instantly cured by him. 

He was beatified by Pius VII, 5 September, 1806, and canonized by Pius X, 20 May, 1909. His feast occurs on 23 March.

The Pathfinder Badge is a military badge of the United States Army awarded to those soldiers who have successfully completed the U.S. Army Infantry School's Pathfinder Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, or the course conducted by the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, KY.

To be awarded the Pathfinder Badge, a soldier must complete instruction in advanced land navigation, advanced scouting, tactical air traffic control in the field, and the control of parachute operations.  The badge is only awarded after completion of a final examination field conditions exercise.

The book "US Army Air Force: 2" by Gordon Rottman and Francis Chin on Army Air Forces uniform insignia of the Second World War states the badge (then unofficial) was designed by a Lt. Prescott, a navigator in the 9th Troop Carrier Pathfinder Group (Provisional).  In addition to the paratroopers who earned the badge, it was worn by IX Troop Carrier Command air crews trained to guide transports laden with paratroopers or towing gliders to designated release points.  The badge was designed in May 1944 and issued to crews prior to the Normandy invasion.  It was worn four inches above the left cuff on the service coat.

Roger Windsor was chief executive of the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers) between 1983 and 1989, including during the 1984 Miner's Strike. He later moved to France.

Windsor was accused of damaging the image of the union by visiting Libya during the strike and meeting Colonel Gaddafi, at the time an enemy of the United Kingdom.  Windsor was supposed to be seeking support from Libyan unions for a ban on oil exports to Britain, but he turned the event into a direct appeal for funds from Gaddafi. The Sunday Times report on his visit was credited by some with substantially undermining public and parliamentary support for the miners.

In 1990 Windsor was involved in a media circus surrounding Arthur Scargill's alleged misuse of union funds and receipt of funds from Libya, allegations which were substantially based on Windsor's evidence. The story was initially reported on the front page of the Daily Mirror and in the Central TV programme The Cook Report, with Windsor paid £80,000 for his support in the investigation. Then Mirror editor Roy Greenslade later wrote an article apologising to Scargill, saying he was now sure the allegations had been untrue. Windsor himself was later found by the French courts to have signed documents he claimed were forged by Scargill, and ordered to repay funds to the NUM.

Some of his actions during and after the strike led to accusations that he was an agent of MI5. The allegations were raised in Parliament, but could not be challenged outside it due to parliamentary privilege. After the allegation was repeated in a 21 May 2000 newspaper article in the Sunday Express by Rupert Allason, Windsor in 2003 won a libel action against the Express and its then editor, Rosie Boycott. The head of the MI5 branch responsible for 'monitoring' unions and strike activity at the time of the strike, Dame Stella Rimington, gave what Greenslade said was an "ambiguous" denial  in 2001, saying that Windsor was "never an agent in any sense of the word that you can possibly imagine".

Ko¨utnjak (Serbian Cyrillic:         ) is a park-forest and urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is divided between in the municipalities of ukarica (upper and central parts) and Rakovica (lower part). 

 Location .

Ko¨utnjak is located 6 km southwest from the downtown Belgrade. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Top ider to the north and west, Kanarevo Brdo to the northwest, Rakovica and Skojevsko Naselje to the south, and ´arkovo (with its extensions of Cerak, Cerak II, Repi¨te) and Banovo Brdo (with its extension of Sun ana Padina) to the east. Filmski Grad (to the southwest) and Golf Naselje (to the northwest) are sub-neighborhoods of Ko¨utnjak.

 Pionirski Grad .

Pionirski Grad (Serbian Cyrillic:               ) is a sub-neighborhood of Koutnjak, in its south-central section, which belongs to the municipality of Rakovica. It is a small weekend-settlement, without permanent population, just west of the neighborhood of Filmski Grad. The name, pionirski grad in Serbian means "pioneer's park".

 Importance .

Ko¨utnjak is one of the most popular recreational places in Belgrade. Sports Center Ko¨utnjak is one of the largest and most diverse in the city (stadiums, pools, etc), while the park also has an auto-camp, modern settlements of Filmski Grad and Pionirski Grad, big studios of the national broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia, many popular restaurants and arranged paths criss-crossing the forest.

In the lower parts, Ko¨utnjak and Top ider forests grew together, while in the upper parts they are divided by the river Top iderska reka and a railway passing through the river's valley (both Ko¨utnjak and Top ider have their own, separate train stations).

 History .

Ko¨utnjak gained a sort of historical notoriety as prince of Serbia, Mihailo Obrenovi  III was assassinated while walking in the park on June 10, 1868 (May 29, Old Style), and when Ivan Stamboli , Slobodan Milo¨evi 's political opponent was abducted from the park on the August 25, 2000 and later assassinated.

The name, Ko¨utnjak, is derived from the medieval hunting forests of the Serbian nobility, meaning doe's breeder. (In Serbian, ko¨uta means doe, hind)

Robert Steven Moore (born January 18 1952) is a prolific singer and songwriter. Often referred to as the "father of DIY home recording", he has maintained a remarkably low profile throughout a career which began in the early-1970s, which has led to his work being classified as outsider music. He has historically released this music through the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, and more recently online and through various netlabels.

Biography.
Born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of famed bassist Bob Moore (often confused with Elvis' guitarist Scotty Moore), the young R. Stevie Moore's musical tastes were often at odds with the predominant country music of the town. He was heavily influenced by the innovative music of The Beatles, and other British Invasion artists, and of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention and Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, among many others, embracing both slick mainstream pop and underground extremes. After relocating to New Jersey he self-released hundreds of cassettes, CDs and home videos, and reveled in the freedom (and yet, curse) of being without a steady record label.

For decades Moore's varied styles have traversed countless musical forms, making his daring releases similar to eclectic free-form radio shows. Adventurous listeners around the world continue to privately sing his praises, admiring and supporting not only his deep talent for consistent originality but also his unique and steadfast independent modus operandi. His self-released albums are virtuoso showcases for Moore's popcentric vision and skill at screwing around with tape decks that don't always behave. Happy accidents make for unpredictable music in the hands of a man who never met a mistake he couldn't tweak to his advantage. He genre-surfs with impunity: quasi-metal guitar weirdness, bastard bluegrass, sweet jangly pop, unclassifiable novelties, tender melodic ballads, and avant-monsterdom that outskronks Thurston Moore and Eugene Chadbourne, with more seductive pop underpinnings than either.

The frontpage of his huge, self-maintained website currently claims RSM "quietly resides as curator of his own museum", yet conversely his celebrated prolific output continues to runneth over, 2 to 3 choice potent albums a year remaining his norm.

R. Stevie Moore is often called a "lost treasure" and "criminally neglected," and perhaps during his lifetime, that may become his biggest credit.

Ariel Pink, a younger musician of growing fame in the indie rock world, cites Moore as a primary influence.

Short description.
The Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BO) is ubiquitous in quantum chemical calculations of molecular wavefunctions. It consists of two steps. 

In the first step the nuclear kinetic energy is neglected,). that is, the corresponding operator  is subtracted from the total molecular Hamiltonian. In the remaining electronic Hamiltonian  the nuclear positions enter as parameters. The electron-nucleus interactions are not removed and the electrons still "feel" the Coulomb potential of the nuclei clamped at certain positions in space. (This first step of the BO approximation is therefore often referred to as the clamped nuclei approximation.)
 
The electronic Schrödinger equation 
;
is solved (out of necessity approximately) with a fixed nuclear geometry as input. The quantity  stands for all electronic coordinates. Obviously, the electronic energy eigenvalue  depends on the chosen positions  of the nuclei. Varying these positions  in small steps and repeatedly solving the electronic Schrödinger equation, one obtains   as a function of . This is the potential energy surface (PES): . Because this procedure of recomputing the electronic wave functions as a function of an infinitesimally   changing nuclear geometry is reminiscent of the conditions for the adiabatic theorem, this manner of obtaining a PES is often referred to as the adiabatic approximation and the PES itself is called an adiabatic surface. 

In the second step of the BO approximation the nuclear kinetic energy  (containing partial derivatives with respect to the components of ) is reintroduced and the Schrödinger equation for the nuclear motion
;
is solved. This second step of the BO approximation is far from trivial and involves separation of vibrational and rotational motion. The real number  is the total energy of the molecule, including contributions from electrons, nuclear vibrations, and rotations.
Footnotes.


Derivation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
It will be discussed how the BO approximation may be derived and under which conditions it is applicable. At the same time we will  show how  the BO approximation may be improved by including vibronic coupling. To that end the second step of the BO approximation is generalized  to a set of coupled eigenvalue equations depending on nuclear coordinates only. Off-diagonal elements in these equations are shown to be nuclear kinetic energy terms. 
It will be shown that the BO approximation can be trusted whenever the PESs, obtained from the solution of
the electronic Schrödinger equation, are well separated:  for all .

We start from the exact non-relativistic, time-independent molecular Hamiltonian:

with

The position vectors 
of the electrons and the position vectors  of the nuclei are with respect to a Cartesian inertial frame. Distances between particles are written as  (distance between electron i and nucleus A) and similar definitions hold for  and .
We assume that the molecule is in a homogeneous
(no external force) and isotropic (no external torque) space. The only interactions are the 
Coulomb interactions between the electrons and nuclei. The Hamiltonian is expressed in atomic units, so that we do not see Planck's constant, the dielectric constant of the vacuum, electronic 
charge, or  electronic mass in this formula. The only constants explicitly entering the formula are ZA and MA the atomic number and charge of nucleus A.

It is useful to introduce the total nuclear momentum and to rewrite the nuclear kinetic energy operator as follows:


Suppose we  have   K electronic eigenfunctions  of , that is,  we have solved

The electronic wave functions  will be taken to be real, which is possible when there are no magnetic or spin interactions. The parametric dependence of the functions  on the nuclear coordinates is indicated by the symbol after the semicolon. This indicates that, although 
is a real-valued function of ,  its functional form depends on . For example,
in the molecular-orbital-linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital (LCAO-MO) approximation, 
 is an MO  given as a linear  expansion of atomic orbitals (AOs). An AO depends
visibly on the coordinates of an electron, but the nuclear coordinates are not explicit in the MO. However, upon change of geometry, i.e., change of , the LCAO coefficients obtain different values and  we see corresponding changes in the functional form of the MO .
We will assume that the parametric dependence is continuous and differentiable, so that
it is meaningful to consider 

which in general will not be zero.

The total wave function  is expanded in terms of :

with

and where the subscript  indicates that the integration, implied by the bra-ket notation,  
is over electronic coordinates only. By definition, the matrix with general element

is diagonal.  After multiplication by  and integration over the electronic coordinates  the total Schrödinger equation

is turned into a set of K coupled eigenvalue equations depending on nuclear coordinates only



The column vector  has elements . The matrix  is diagonal and the nuclear Hamilton matrix is non-diagonal with the following off-diagonal (vibronic coupling) terms,


The vibronic coupling in this approach is through nuclear kinetic energy terms. 
Solution of these coupled equations gives an approximation for energy and wavefunction that goes beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. 
Unfortunately, the off-diagonal kinetic energy terms are usually difficult to handle. This is why often a diabatic transformation is applied, which retains part of the nuclear kinetic energy terms on the diagonal, removes the kinetic energy terms from the off-diagonal and creates coupling terms between the adiabatic PESs on the off-diagonal.

If we can neglect the off-diagonal elements the equations will uncouple and simplify drastically. In order to show when this neglect is justified, we
suppres the coordinates in the notation and write, by applying the Leibniz rule for differentation, the matrix elements of   as


The diagonal () matrix elements  of the operator  vanish, because this operator is Hermitian and purely imaginary. The off-diagonal matrix elements satisfy


The matrix element in the numerator is

The matrix element of the one-electron operator appearing on the right hand side is finite.
When the two surfaces come close, , the nuclear momentum coupling term becomes large and is no longer negligible. This is the case where
the BO approximation breaks down and a coupled set of nuclear motion equations must be considered, instead of the one equation appearing in the second step of the BO approximation.

Conversely, if all surfaces are well separated, all off-diagonal terms can be neglected and hence the whole matrix of  is effectively zero. The third term on the right hand side of the expression for the matrix element of Tn (the Born-Oppenheimer diagonal  correction) can approximately be written as the matrix of  squared and, accordingly, is then negligible also. Only the first (diagonal) kinetic energy term in this equation survives in the case of well-separated surfaces and a diagonal, uncoupled,  set of nuclear motion equations results,

which are the normal second-step of the BO equations discussed above.

We reiterate that when two or more potential energy surface approach each other, or even cross, the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation breaks down and one must fall back on the coupled equations. Usually one
invokes then the diabatic approximation.

Historical note.
The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is named after M. Born and R. Oppenheimer who wrote a paper
der Physik, vol. 84, pp. 457-484 (1927)  entitled: Zur Quantentheorie der Molekeln (On the Quantum Theory of Molecules). This paper describes  the separation of electronic motion, nuclear vibrations, and molecular rotation. Somebody who  expects to find in this paper the BO approximation as it is explained above and in most modern textboooks will be in for a surprise. The reason being that the presentation of the BO approximation is well hidden in  Taylor expansions (in terms of internal and external nuclear coordinates) of (i)  electronic wave functions, (ii) potential energy surfaces and (iii) nuclear kinetic energy terms. Internal coordinates are the relative positions of the nuclei in the molecular equilibrium and their displacements (vibrations) from equilibrium. External coordinates are the position of the center of mass and the orientation of the molecule. The Taylor expansions complicate the theory and make the derivations
very hard to follow. Moreover, knowing that the proper separation of vibrations and rotations was not achieved in this paper, but only 8 years later C. Eckart, Physical Review, vol. 46, pp. 383-387 (1935) (see Eckart conditions), one is not very much motivated to spend much effort into understanding the work by and Born and Oppenheimer, how famous it may be. Although the article still collects many citations each year, it is safe to say that it is not read anymore (except perhaps by historians of science).

Fictional character biography.
Slither (Aaron Salomon) is a fictional character, a mutant in the Marvel Comics Universe. His first appearance was in Captain America Annual #4.

Salomon was recruited, alongside four other mutant men (Burner, Lifter, Peepers, and Shocker), to serve in Magneto s new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

Wanting to exploit a tiny spaceship he had found, Magneto sent the Brotherhood to apprehend the diminutive Mister One, who controlled the large Mister Two.  The villains attacked One and Two, and Captain America, in a park.  During the battle, Salomon wrapped himself around Captain America, stating,  Slither is my name!,  and strangling is my game! . When S.H.I.E.L.D. arrived, the Brotherhood fled back to headquarters, and Magneto captured Mister One.  The Brotherhood was shocked to learn the plot involved the tiny spaceship.  When Captain America and Mister Two attacked, Salomon constricted around Two until Two threw Salomon against Lifter.  As he prepared to crush Captain America, Two threw Salomon around Lifter, incapacitating him.  When Mister One exploded the tiny spaceship, the villains were forced to flee.

The five mutants, abandoned by Magneto, were hired by the Mandrill and given the team name of the Mutant Force, a name they kept in the following years.  They attacked a Coloradan Air-Force base with an army of female warriors (under the control of the Mandrill).  When the Defenders (Hellcat, Valkyrie, Wasp, Yellowjacket) attacked, Salomon constricted around Valkyrie, until Yellowjacket zapped him.  When things got out of hand, Burner, Lifter, and Peeper were able to escape with a pile of gold and an unconscious Yellowjacket, leaving Salomon and Shocker behind.

The three villains battled the Defenders alongside the women warriors again and rescued their teammates.  During the battle, the Wasp hit Salomon with a blast, then Burner s flames kept Salomon from attacking for a time.  Salomon constricted around a fallen Hellcat.  After capturing Valkyrie, Hellcat, and the Wasp, they returned to the base, where Mandrill put the women under his control and put Valkyrie in charge of the Mutant Force.  The mutants caroused with the controlled women, and Salomon made out with one.  After the Wasp escaped, the Mandrill ordered his forces to attack the Air Force again.

In their battle with the army, Salomon wrapped himself around individual soldiers.  All the surviving soldiers were rounded up in one building and held under an electrical field created by the Shocker.  Nighthawk attacked, and soon the field was shorted out and the Mutant Force was quickly defeated.

The Mutant Force, still in custody, was brought before a special United States Intelligence Services branch.  They agreed to become special government operatives in exchange for full presidential pardons.

After the Hulk invaded a baseball stadium, the Mutant Force was sent in with the army to stop him, and the stadium was evacuated.  During the battle, Salomon tried to suffocate the Hulk by constricting around his head, but was thrown aside into Shocker.  Valkyrie and Hellcat attacked, and Valkyrie knocked a structure down on the mutants, the Hulk escaped.

The Mutant Force was called to testify against the Defenders in what they thought was a government inquisition (but was actually the alien Tribunal).  Lifter testified about their recent battle with the Defenders. 

No longer working for the government, the Mutant Force (minus Peeper) was recruited by the Secret Empire alongside several other operatives.  Mad-Dog was put in charge of the Mutant Force.  

Mad-Dog and the Mutant Force were sent in to attack the Defenders at the wedding of Hellcat and the Son of Satan in Greentown, Ohio.  During the battle, Salomon restrained the Beast by constricting around him, but the Beast shortly knocked Slither unconscious.  The villains were quickly defeated.

The villains were held in SHIELD null-fields for questioning.  Professor Power arranged for their release while Leviathan created a distraction.

Equipped with special strength-sapping devices, Calley fought alongside the other Secret Empire operatives (Mad Dog, Mutant Force, Leviathan, Seraph, and Harridan) against the Defenders, who were quickly captured.  

Mad Dog and the Mutant Force fought off the attacking Defenders while the Secret Empire launched a satellite that would start a world war.

The satellite exploded, and the Defenders quickly defeated the villains.

For unknown reasons, Salomon joined up with the Viper, an international terrorist and murderer, and began to act as her lackey.  While there, his intelligence seemed far less.  He followed her plan to infiltrate the Serpent Society and release a toxin into the water that would turn much of America into human snakes.

Salomon, with Viper, Coachwhip, and Puff Adder, helped interrogate the villainous members of the Serpent Society to coax them into joining Viper's group.  Black Mamba, the Asp, Diamondback and Bushmaster (with the deposed Sidewinder) refused to join with Viper, but the rest of the villains did.  When Captain America, Diamondback, and Nomad attacked and started defeating the villains, Salomon leaped at Captain America and was zapped by one of Coachwhip's whips.  Later, Salomon leaped on Demolition Man (also attacking), but was brutally knocked out on Nomad.

Salomon was taken captive aboard the heroes ship.  Nomad, D-Man, and Diamondback were joined by the Falcon.  Nomad interrogated Salomon brutally.  The heroes landed the ship and ran out, leaving Salomon tied up aboard.

As part of Viper's group, the Fangs (with Bludgeon, Heat-Ray, and Razorblade) Salomon assisted Viper in her latest Nihilistic plot, to blind every American who owned a TV set.  When Viper got captured, she was tortured by the Red Skull's agent, the Iron Monger, who broke Viper's leg.  The Fangs, armed with guns and jet-packs, rescued Viper.  Back at the base, Captain America (Steve Rogers), Battlestar, and Silver Sable attacked. Salomon constricted around Sable, who stabbed him with several weapons and left him moaning in pain.  The heroes successfully stopped the plot.

Back together with the Mutant Force, Salomon attacked an armored truck for money.  The New Warriors noticed and attacked.  Speedball bounced an unconscious Salomon into the open truck.  All the villains were quickly defeated.

Powers.
Slither greatly resembles a large snake with arms and legs, and has scaled skin.  Slither can wrap his flexible body around an opponent as a snake can, and constrict himself, exerting suffocating pressure upon his victim. Has superhuman strength.

Riverside County is a county located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of California, stretching from Orange County to the Colorado River, which is the border with Arizona. This county is part of the Greater Los Angeles Area, in an area of Southern California known as the Inland Empire.

As of 2000 the population was 1,545,387.  The county seat is Riverside.

Geographically, the county is desert.  Most of Joshua Tree National Park is located in the county.  Riverside County lies inland of Los Angeles, and large numbers of Los Angeles workers have moved to the county in recent years to take advantage of relatively affordable housing costs. Alongside neighboring San Bernardino County, it is one of the fastest growing parts of Greater Los Angeles. This spawned a wave of toll road construction in the area in the 1990s, starting with the addition of toll commuter lanes to the 91 freeway, the main traffic artery to the western metropolis.

Such famous golf resorts as Indian Wells, La Quinta, Rancho Mirage, Palm Springs and Palm Desert are located in Riverside County.  Indio is the center of an important date growing region.

History.
Riverside County was created in 1893 from parts of San Bernardino and San Diego Counties.

The county derives its name from the City of Riverside, christened when the upper canal of the Santa Ana River reached it in 1871.

Geography.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 18,915 km² (7,303 mi²).  18,667 km² (7,207 mi²) of it is land and 248 km² (96 mi²) of it (1.31%) is water. At roughly 180 miles wide in the east-west dimension, the area of the county is massive. County government documents frequently cite the Colorado River town of Blythe as being a "three hour drive" from the county seat, Riverside. Some view the areas west of San Gorgonio Pass as the Inland Empire portion of the county and the eastern part as either the Mojave Desert or Colorado Desert portion. There are probably at least three geomorphic provinces: the Inland Empire western portion, the Santa Rosa Mountains communities, and the desert region. Other possible subdivisions include tribal lands, the Colorado River communities, and the Salton Sink. 

Serving this area are 19 healthcare facilities identified as "General Acute Care Hospitals." Five of these are identified as rural, sixteen provide at least basic emergency care, and three are level 2 trauma centers. The State of California defines Riverside county as Health Service Area 12. 

There are 14 major airports in Riverside County. County government projections expect the county's population to roughly double between 2004 and 2040. Most of the growth is expected in communities viewed as being within practical commute distances of work in Los Angeles County and Orange County. 

In California, each County Office of Education has influence over funding and operation of schools within its area. The county includes a total of about 380 public schools including Riverside's California School for the Deaf. These schools are operated by about 24 school districts and by Tribal governments in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The Inland Empire area of southern California is made up of the western portion of Riverside County.

Law, government and politics.

Legal system.

The Riverside Superior Court is responsible for upholding the law for Riverside County.  The unified trial court system has a total of 13 courts: Riverside Historic Courthouse, Riverside Hall of Justice, Riverside Family Law Court, Riverside Juvenile Court, Southwest Justice Center - Murrieta, Moreno Valley Court, Banning Court, Hemet Court, Temecula Court, Larson Justice Center - Indio, Larson Justice Center - Annex, Indio Juvenile Court, and Blythe Court.

The main courthouse is the Riverside Historic Courthouse.  This landmark, erected in 1904, was modeled after the Grand and Petit Palais in Paris, France.  The courthouse, designed by Los Angeles architects Burnham and Bliesner, has a classical design including a great hall that connects all the departments (courtrooms). In 1994, the courthouse was shut down for seismic retrofits due to the 1992 Landers and 1994 Northridge earthquakes.  The courthouse was rededicated in September 1998.

 Formation .


Mrs. Robinson are an up and coming girl group from London, England. The band consiosts of three members - Tanya Robinson, Shereen Guerin & Paula-Jade Cremin.

The band was founded in mid-2004, when de-facto leader Tanya Robinson met media personality Darryn Lyons at a FHM party. Tanya initially expressed interest in singing career and with Darryn's experience in the media and connecions he decided to take a risk and took on the role of manager. After many recordings it was soon realised that despite the fact that Tanya did have a good voice, it wasn't considered strong enough to launch a solo career, so the idea of forming a girl group arose.

Tanya quickly brought in Shereen Guerin, an acquaintance of hers on the modelling cicuit and the two held auditions and then recruited Charlotte Gaskell, who would later take on the role of lead singer. The abdn along with Darryn came up with the idea of calling the band Twisted Sisterz.

After a year of recording, performing and rehearsing, cracks began to show in the band's lineup, the result of which ended in lead singer Charlotte Gaskell being fired by the band's manager Darryn Lyons. With Charlotte gone the band needed a new lead singer, and through one of the producers of their album Paula-Jade Cremin was hired, though it wasn't without scepticism, as many on the band's management thought that she was to shy and inexperienced compared to Tanya and Sheree. However manager Darryn Lyons took another risk and hired Paula-Jade.

With lineup complete, the recording finished and dance-movesd rehearsed it seemed nothihng more could go wrong, however it did. Hardcore American heavy metal band Twisted Sister threatened to sue the band if they didn't change their name from the chosen Twisted Sisterz to a new name, manger Lyons commented on his TV series Paparazzi tat it was riduclous, saying "We're called Twisted Sisterz with a "z", plus we've got three incredibly hot babes, their five or six ugly bastards."

But the cost of being sued was to great and the name was changed to Mrs. Robinson, it was later announced on Paparazzi that the song I'm A Little Obsessed would be the band's first single.

Spelljammer (1989) is a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd edition) role-playing game, which features a fantastical (as opposed to scientific) outer space environment.

Spelljammer introduced into the AD&D universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics, including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal spheres. Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with "spelljamming helms". Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space.  With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere, the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction, but instead look more like galleons, animals, birds, fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes. 

The Spelljammer setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of Dungeons & Dragons to take place within the framework of outer space tropes.  Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space, visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects.

Like the Planescape setting, Spelljammer unifies most of the other AD&D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting (say, Dragonlance) to travel to another (say, the Forgotten Realms).  However, unlike Planescape it keeps all of the action on the Prime Material Plane and uses the crystal spheres, and the "phlogiston" between them, to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings. Though the cosmology is derived largely from the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, many of the ideas owe much to the works of Jules Verne and his contemporaries, and to related games and fiction with a steampunk flavor.  A strong Age of Sail flavor is also present.

The Fantasy Astrophysics of Spelljammer.
 Spelljamming helms .
Spelljamming helms are the central setting concept which allow interplanetary and interstellar space travel for vessels which would otherwise not be spaceworthy.  Within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, they are a method of converting magical energy into motive power.

Gravity and Air.
All bodies of a sufficiently large size have gravity.  This gravity usually (but not always) exerts a force equal to the standard gravitational attraction on the surface of an Earth-sized planetary body.  Gravity in the Spelljammer universe is also an exceptionally convenient force, and almost always works such that "down" orients itself in a manner most humanoids would find sensible.

All bodies of any size carry with them an envelope of air whenever they leave the surface of a planet or other stellar object.  Unlike real-world astrophysics, this air envelope is not dispersed by the vacuum of space.  These bubbles of air provide breathable atmosphere for varying lengths of time, but 3 months is considered "standard".

Crystal Spheres.
A crystal sphere (also known as a crystal shell) is a gigantic spherical shell which contains an entire planetary system. Each sphere varies in size but typically they are twice the diameter of the orbit of the planet that is furthest from the sun or planet at the centre of the sphere (the system's primary).

The surface of the sphere is called the "sphere wall" and separates the void of "wildspace" (within the sphere) from the "phlogiston" (that surrounds and flows outside the sphere). The sphere wall has no gravity and appears to be impossible to damage by any normal or magical means. Portals allow spelljamming ships or wildspace creatures to pass through the sphere wall and enter or exit from a crystal sphere. Portals can spontaneously open and close anywhere on the sphere wall. Magical spells (or magical items that reproduce their effects) can allow a portal to be located. Other magic can open a new portal or collapse an existing one. Ships or creatures passing through a portal when it closes may be cut in two.

Note that unlike the Ptolemaic system, the crystal spheres are not nested within each other.

The Phlogiston.
The phlogiston (also known as "the Flow") is a bright, extremely combustible gas-like medium that exists between the Crystal Spheres.  Every crystal sphere floats in the phlogiston, very slowly bobbing up and down over time.  Travel between Crystal Spheres is facilitated by the formation of "Flow rivers"   sections of the phlogiston which have a current and greatly reduce travel time.  Travel through the "slow flow" (i.e. off the Flow rivers) is possible, but very dangerous.

The Spelljammer.
The Spelljammer is a legendary ship which looks like a gigantic manta ray, and houses an entire city on its back.  All spacefarers (people who live in wildspace) have heard of the Spelljammer but very few have ever seen it themselves. It is this ship that gives its name to "spelljamming", "spelljamming helms" and anything else connected with spelljamming. The ship has been reported to have been seen in countless spheres for as long as records go back. Even some groundlings (people who live on planets that have very little or no commerce with spelljamming communities) have legends about it. There are hundreds of conflicting legends about this ship, and a mythology has developed about the ship that is similar to the legends surrounding The Flying Dutchman.

As a living thing (although it consumes no matter it does absorb heat and light through its dorsal side and uses them to produce air and food for its inhabitants), the Spelljammer has a complex life cycle and means of procreation. Normally the ship has no captain and wanders the cosmos seemingly aimlessly. When the Spelljammer has a captain, obtained through another complex process, it will create Smalljammers (miniature versions of the Spelljammer) that go forth as its spawn. Apparently there can only be one Spelljammer at any one time. One Smalljammer will mature into a full Spelljammer ship if it is ever destroyed.

For more details on the Spelljammer ship, please consult the Legend of the Spelljammer boxed set, which was released by TSR in 1991.

Races.

Alien races inhabiting the Spelljammer universe included humans, dwarves, xenophobic beholders, rapacious neogi, militant giff, centaurlike dracons, hubristic elf armadas, mysterious arcane, Thri-Kreen, and bumbling tinker gnomes. Illithids were another major race, but were presented as more mercantile and less overtly evil than in other D&D settings. The Monstrous Compendium series added many more minor races.

 Spelljammer and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd edition) .
Several of TSR's other campaign worlds had their own sections in the Spelljammer Boxed Set - Realmspace for the Forgotten Realms, Krynnspace for Dragonlance, and Greyspace for Greyhawk. Dark Sun, Ravenloft and Mystara weren't included, as the first two did not fit with the setting and the Mystara only used the D&D rules, not the AD&D rules. Along with the new sphere - Clusterspace - they were known as the "Big Three and Astromundi". For more details, see List of Spelljammer crystal spheres.

 Spelljammer and Dungeons & Dragons (3rd edition) . 


The Spelljammer line of products was discontinued by TSR before they were incorporated into Wizards of the Coast. Although Wizards of the Coast have not produced any new Spelljammer products they have given permission for a non-profit website, named Beyond the Moons, to continue support for the setting. Beyond the Moons is the official Spelljammer website and produces new material for Spelljammer AD&D (2nd edition), and converts existing AD&D material to work with the new D&D (3rd edition) game.

 Hackjammer and Hackmaster .
In 2005, Kenzer & Co. released the Hackjammer, a campaign supplement which converted much of the Spelljammer setting to the Hackmaster system.

 Spelljammer novels .
Six novels set in the Spelljammer universe were published by TSR, before TSR was incorporated into Wizards of the Coast.  The novels were interconnected and formed "The Cloakmaster Cycle". The novels tell the story of Teldin Moore, a 'groundling' farmer on Krynn who has a powerful and apparently cursed magical item given to him. He then ends up on a quest, which takes him first into wildspace and then away from his home sphere to distant crystal spheres. The novels are now out of print.

Jens Munk (1579 1628) was a Danish navigator, born near Arendal, Norway.  In 1619, under the auspices of King Christian IV, he set out with two ships to discover the Northwest Passage to the Indies and China.  He penetrated Davis Strait as far north as 69  and then turned southward and spent the winter on Chesterfield Inlet.  Cold, famine, and scurvy destroyed so many of his men that only two persons besides himself survived.  With these he sailed for home, reaching Bergen, Norway, in September, 1620.  Just when ready to start on a new Northwest Passage journey to take possession of "New Denmark" for the Danish crown he died.  An account of his first voyage was published at Copenhagen in 1623 as Efterretning af Navigationen og Reisen til det Nye Danmark af Styrmand Jens Munk, new edition by Peter Lauridsen (Copenhagen, 1883);  C.

The keyboard bass is, as its name suggests, a keyboard alternative for the bass guitar or double bass. The earliest one of these was the Fender Rhodes piano bass, pictured at the side. They are a common alternative to bass guitars in rap and modern R&B music today.

Other variants of the keyboard bass include bass pedals, which are operated by musicians using their feet, usually the guitar player or bass player of a band, e.g. Genesis' Mike Rutherford, Rush's Geddy Lee, The Police's Sting or Marillion's Pete Trewavas. The most visible keyboard bass player in recent history is probably The Doors' Ray Manzarek.

<doc id="1402517" title="Chicken's Neck" nonfiltered="610" processed="602" dbindex="1480615">



Chicken Neck is the name of two separate areas in India.
Northeast.
The Chicken's Neck or Siliguri Corridor is a narrow stretch of land which connects India's north-eastern states to the rest of India. This 'isthmus' of land is only 21 to 40 km in width, with the countries of Nepal and Bangladesh lying on either side of the corridor. 

The city of Siliguri, which lies in the state of West Bengal, is the major city in this area (therefore the alternate name "Siliguri Corridor"). The city is the central node which connects Bhutan, Nepal, north-east India and mainland India. 

The Chicken's Neck was created in 1947 after the state of Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). This strip was drawn on the map to allow India access to the state of Assam. Being a sensitive area amidst three countries, the strip is heavily patrolled by the Indian army, the Assam Rifles, the Border Security Force and the West Bengal police. In recent times the area has become the focus of illegal crossings between Bangladesh rebels and Nepali Maoist insurgents, both in search of refuge from their government forces. A flourishing narcotics and weapons traffic also takes place in this region.

All land transportation between the rest of India and its far eastern states have to make use of this circuitous corridor as free trade between Bangladesh and India has yet to be made a reality. The route has a major broad gauge railway line in addition to the old metre gauge line which connects the north-eastern states with the rest of India. National Highway 31 connects Siliguri to Guwahati in Assam which is the most critical highway in the region, owing to the insurgents in the vicinity. Often insurgents in Assam bomb the railway line to excide the state from the rest of India. 

In recent times Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh have proposed to set up the area as a free trade zone which would enable all three countries to connect directly with each other without restrictions.

Northwest.
Chicken's Neck is also the name for another narrow and sensitive piece of land that stands between India and Pakistan in the disputed western unofficial border of Kashmir. It lies south of Akhnur, measuring roughly 170 km². It has been a focal point in all the wars involving the two nations as it is seen as a corridor towards most of Indian held Kashmir. One of the main thrusts of the Operation Grand Slam in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was to capture this vital route that could potentially choke the Indian Army in the region; the plan however failed. During the 1971 war Indian troops were able to take possession of this sensitive strip of land.

Sexpartite vault, in architecture, is a name given to the single bay of a vault, which, in addition to the transverse and diagonal ribs, has been divided by a second transverse rib, forming six compartments.

The principal examples are those in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes and Abbaye-aux-Dames at Caen (which were probably the earliest examples of a construction now looked upon as transitional), Notre Dame de Paris, and the cathedrals of Bourges, Laon, Noyon, Senlis and Sens; from the latter cathedral the sexpartite vault was brought by William of Sens to Canterbury, and it is afterwards found at Lincoln and in St Faith's Chapel, Westminster Abbey.

<doc id="5282737" title="Simon Kapwepwe" nonfiltered="618" processed="610" dbindex="1480623">
Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe (1922-1980) was the second vice-president of Zambia from 1967 to 1970.

 Early life .
Simon Kapwepwe was born on 12 April 1922 in the Chinsali district of the northern province of Northern Rhodesia. Although Chinsali was remote from the country's urban centres, it was an area of political importance. It was also an area of strong religious competition between the protestant United Free Church of Scotland (based at Lubwa from 1905) and the Roman Catholic White Fathers mission (based at Ilondola from 1934). One of Lubwa's early missionaries was David Kaunda, the father of Kenneth Kaunda (who became the first president of Zambia in 1964). Simon Kapwepwe became Zambia's second vice-president. Both Kapwepwe and Kenneth Kaunda had their primary education at Lubwa mission. They were together again at Lubwa Mission when they were undergoing training to become teachers.

 Independence Struggle .

Kapwepwe moved to Kitwe on the Copperbelt, where he got a job teaching in a primary school. Due to his dissatisfaction with the policies of the colonial Northern Rhodesian government, he became a founding member of the Northern Rhodesian African Congress in 1948. This party was soon renamed the Africa National Congress (ANC) under the leadership of Harry Nkumbula. Kapwepwe was a member of the national executive and became secretary of the Kitwe Branch. However, in 1949, Kapwepwe returned to Chinsali with Kaunda, where they planned to start a farm. Both of them remained politically active through the Chinsali African Welfare Association, which doubled as a branch of the ANC.

Kapwepwe secured a scholarship to India in 1950, so he terminated his teaching career in order to pursue further studies for four years. One of the subjects he studied was journalism. In his absence, the White settlers achieved their long-cherished dream of creating the Central African Federation (or the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland) in October 1953. The Black African majority's opposition to this new entity was organized by the ANC, but it was not very successful. On Kapwepwe's return to Northern Rhodesia in January 1955 he found the ANC leaderless, since both Harry Nkumbula and Kenneth Kaunda had been imprisoned for two months for distributing "subversive" literature. In their absence, Kapwepwe assumed the mantle of leadership and introduced policies of racial equality and passive resistance to colonial power, tactics which he had learned that Indians, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, had used most effectively against British colonialism. When Nkumbula returned from prison, he appointed Kapwepwe to the position of ANC Provincial President for Northern Province. Kapwepwe later held the position of ANC's treasurer.

Nkumbula's allegedly autocratic leadership and his willingness to compromise on the fundamental issue of majority rule resulted in a rift within the ANC. Kapwepwe, together with Kaunda and other more militant members, broke away and formed the Zambia African National Congress (ZANC) in October 1958. This party was banned by the colonial authorities in March 1959, its leaders were detained and Kapwepwe was sent to Mongu, in Barotseland. While the ZANC leadership was in jail, Mainza Chona and other nationalists broke away from ANC and formed a new party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP). Kapwepwe and the other imprisoned leaders of ZANC joined the new party. When he was release from jail in December 1959, he helped organize provincial and district branches of UNIP in Barotseland.

In 1960, Kapwepwe and Kaunda attended the Federal Review Conference in London, together with Mainza Chona and Harry Nkumbula. This conference dug the grave of the Central African Federation and laid the foundations for the independence of Zambia and Malawi. As preparation for this eventuality, an election was held in Northern Rhodesia in October 1962. Kapwepwe challenged Dauti Yamba and won convincingly. The result of the election was a UNIP/ANC coalition government in which Kapwepwe was given the post of Minister of African Agriculture.

 After Independence .

The General Election held in January 1964 was won by UNIP with 55 seats, as opposed to the ANC's 10 seats. Kapwepwe was given the post of Minister of Home Affairs. In September 1964, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and held that post for three years. During that time he lambasted the British government for failing to stop or control Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence under the rebellious Ian Smith in 1965.

Despite their friendship from childhood, Kapwepwe and Kaunda drifted apart after leading Zambia to independence. For example, in 1967 Kapwepwe led a rebellion within UNIP. He stood against Reuben Kamanga and the won position of deputy leader within UNIP. As a consequence, Kaunda promoted him to the position of republican Vice President. He used his new position to put forward economic policies that differed from Kaunda's, but his views were sidelined. He also campaigned for the preservation of Zambian culture through the teaching of indigenous languages in schools. In August 1969, he offered to resign from the Vice Presidency and the deputy leadership of UNIP. This move was precipitated by tribal friction within UNIP. Kaunda did not want to lose him and managed to dissuade him from taking that move. However, in October 1970 Kaunda replaced Kapwepwe with Mainza Chona in the post of Vice President. Kapwepwe was allowed to keep the posts of Minister of Culture and Minister of Local Government.

 The end of political life .

Kapwepwe's life in UNIP began drawing to an end when he was linked with rumours of a new party called the United Progressive Party (UPP) that had been formed on the Copperbelt. He did not own up until Kaunda dismissed four cabinet ministers on suspicion of being clandestine members of the new party. In August 1971, Kapwepwe resigned from UNIP and the government then he announced that he was, indeed, the leader of UPP. In December 1971 he won a by-election for the Mufulira West constituency and became his party's sole representative in parliament. Kaunda was not pleased with this development so, on 4 February 1972, he banned UPP and imprisoned 122 members of the party, including Kapwepwe. Kaunda's excuse was that UPP was an instrument of the White Rhodesian, South African and Portuguese governments. Kapwepwe was kept in prison until 31 December 1972. By then, Kaunda had neutralized any threat that Kapwepwe could pose: the Chona Commission, under the chairmanship of Mainza Chona, was appointed in February 1972 to make recommendations for the constitution of a  one-party participatory democracy  (i.e. a one-party state). After collecting four months of public hearings, the commission's report was submitted to Kaunda in October 1972. The Second Republic (i.e. the one-party state) was inaugurated on 1 January 1973, the day after Kapwepwe was released from detention.

Kapwepwe was harassed even after he had been politically emasculated. He was arrested in February 1973 for illegal possession of two guns. He received a two-years suspended sentence. The UNIP-controlled Zambian media reported that Kapwepwe had sent people for military training outside Zambia. He sued the Zambia Broadcasting Services, the Times of Zambia and the Zambia Daily Mail for libel and won when he proved that they had made false reports.

Kapwepwe turned his back on politics and went to live on his farm in Chinsali. In the spirit of national unity, Kaunda asked Kapwepwe to return to UNIP in September 1977. To test his erstwhile friend's sincerity, Kapwepwe stood for the 1978 one-party presidential nomination against Kaunda. He was disqualified by last-minute changes to UNIP's constitution. He retired for good from politics and returned to Chinsali.

He died on 26 January 1980, after suffering from a stroke two days earlier.

<doc id="1591104" title="OGLE-TR-10 b" nonfiltered="619" processed="611" dbindex="1480624">


OGLE-TR-10b is an extrasolar planet orbiting star OGLE-TR-10.

The planet was first detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey in 2002. The star, OGLE-TR-10, was seen dimming by a tiny amount every 3 days. The transit lightcurve resembles that of HD 209458 b, the first transiting extrasolar planet. However, the mass of the object had to be measured by the radial velocity method, because other objects like red dwarfs and brown dwarfs can mimic the planetary transit. In late 2004 it was confirmed as the 5th planetary discovery by OGLE.

The planet is a typical "hot Jupiter", a planet with a mass half that of Jupiter and orbital distance only 1/24th that of Earth from the Sun. One revolution around the star takes a little over three day to complete. The planet is slightly larger than Jupiter, probably due the heat from the star.

OGLE-TR-10 was identified as a promising candidate by the OGLE team during their 2001 campaign in three fields towards the Galactic center (Andrzej Udalski et al, 2002). The possible planetary nature of its companion based on spectroscopic follow-up was first established by Konacki et al (2003). We reported a tentative radial velocity semi-amplitude (from Keck-I/HIRES) of 100+/-43 m/s, and a mass for the putative planet of 0.7 +/- 0.3 MJup. This was confirmed by Bouchy et al (2004) with their UVES/FLAMES radial velocities. However, the possibility of a blend could not be ruled out. 

Now we are able to rule out a blend scenario as an alternative explanation. From an analysis combining all available radial velocity measurements with the OGLE light curve we find that OGLE-TR-10b has a mass of 0.57 +/- 0.12 MJup and
a radius of 1.24 +/- 0.09 RJup. These parameters bear
close resemblance to those of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD 209458b.

Note an apparent dichotomy in the mass-radius diagram in that the 4 planets with the longer periods (in the hot Jupiter class) all have small masses (~0.7 MJup), while all the short-period planets (very hot Jupiters) have
masses roughly twice as large. This trend, noted previously by Mazeh et al (2005), now seems to be reinforced, and may perhaps be related to issues of survival of planets in proximity to their parent stars.

Chaliyar River is the fourth longest river in Kerala at 169 km in length. The Chaliyar river is also known as Beypore River as it nears the sea. Nilambur, Edavanna, Cheruvadi, Mavoor, Feroke and Beypore are some of the towns/villages situated along the Chaliyar River.



Course.
The Chaliyar originates in the Western Ghats range at Ilambari Hills located in the Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu and flows through Malappuram District for most of its length and then for around 17 km it forms the boundary between Malappuram District and Kozhikode District before  entering the city of Kozhikode for its final 10 Km journey  and finally empties into the Arabian Sea. Some of the Chaliyar's tributaries originate from Wayanad District and joins the main river in Malappuram.

Economy.
During late 19th century and early 20th century, the Chaliyar was extensively used as a waterway for carrying timber from the forest areas in and around Nilambur to the various mills in Kallayi near Calicut. Rafts made of logs were taken downstream during the monsoon season to Kallayi, where these were sawn to size in the timber mills dotting the banks of the river. Kallayi was during this period one of the most important centers in the world for timber business. The place was famous for wood of superlative strength and durability like teak, rosewood etc. Towards the second half of the 20th century, the activity came down drastically as tree felling was banned or strictly controlled with a view to stop deforestation. Many mills still operate in Kallayi, though with far less output. Many have closed down.  

Ecology.
Chaliyar River was in the news a few years ago because of the ecological damage caused by a pulp factory that released effluents into the river and affected the marine life. This factory has since closed down.

For the song by Regina Spektor, see Fidelity.  For the financial services company, see Fidelity Investments. Fidelity is also the name of a village in Illinois and a town in Missouri.;



Fidelity is a notion that at its most abstract level implies a truthful connection to a source or sources. Its original meaning dealt with loyalty and attentiveness to one's duty to a lord or a king, in a broader sense than the related concept of fealty. Both derive from the Latin word fidelitas, meaning "faithfulness."

In modern human relationships, the term can refer to sexual monogamy.  In western culture this often means adherence to marriage vows, or of promises of exclusivity or monogamy, and a lack of adultery. However, some people do not equate fidelity in personal relationships with sexual or emotional monogamy. (For example, see polyamory and Open marriage.)

Fidelity also denotes how accurate a copy is to its source. For example, a worn gramophone record will have a lower fidelity than one in good condition, and a recording made by a low budget record company in the early 20th century is likely to have significantly less audio fidelity than a good modern recording. In the 1950s, the terms "high fidelity" or "hi-fi" were popularized for equipment and recordings designed for more accurate sound reproduction, while "lo-fi" music aims for "authenticity" over perfect production. Similarly in electronics, fidelity refers to the correspondence of the output signal to the input signal, rather than sound.

In religion, the fidelity of God is said to refer to His devotion, faithfuless and commitment toward all creations, as exemplified in the Old Testament of the Bible.

Genetic evolution refers to the change in gene frequency, which is the frequency of alleles in a breeding population from generation to generation. This term is used by population genetics for a more specific definition than the one given for the term evolution ( descent with modification over the generations ). Any factor that contributes to such a change can be considered a mechanism for genetic evolution. Those mechanisms include natural selection, mutation, random genetic drift, and gene flow. The first mechanism, natural selection, remains the best explanation for genetic evolution. Once gene frequencies change and adaptation through natural selection occurs, traits that have proven to be most adaptive will be selected again and again through directional selection, or long term selection of the same trait(s). The second mechanism of genetic evolution is mutation, which occurs spontaneously and regularly and provides new biochemical forms on which natural selection operates. The third genetic evolution mechanism is random genetic drift, which is the change in allele frequency that results from chance and is most common in small populations. The fourth and final genetic evolution mechanism is gene flow, which is more or less the exchange of genetic material between populations of the same species.

<doc id="4934453" title="Evergreen Hills Plantation" nonfiltered="624" processed="616" dbindex="1480629">

Evergreen Hills Plantation was a large cotton plantation of 6700 acres (27 km2) located in eastern Leon County, Florida, United States established by Green A. Chaires.

Location.
Evergreen Hills was located in 2 tracts. The first tract was bordered Joseph John Williams' La Grange Plantation on the north and the Francis Eppes Plantation to the east.

The second tract was at the east end of Lake Lafayette, Florida and bordered a 2nd tract of Chemonie Plantation on the east. Green's Evergreen Hills Plantation, with Benjamin's Vendura Plantation and Thomas Peter's Woodlawn Plantation, would form the community hub of Chaires, Florida. In 2000 the community of Chaires was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Today the Chaires-Capitola Community Park, the neighborhoods around Chaires Cross Road, Green Oak Drive, Boykin Road, Boyette Lane, Bucklake Road, Farraway Farms and others occupy the land.

Plantation specifics.
The Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows that the Evergreen Hills Plantation had the following:
 Improved Land: 3600 acres (14  km²);
 Unimproved Land: 3100 acres (12  km²);
 Cash value of plantation: $53,600;
 Cash value of farm implements/machinery: $900;
 Cash value of farm animals: $11,460;
 Number of slaves: 135;
 Bushels of corn: 6000;
 Bales of cotton: 350;

The owner.
Green Chaires' father was Major Benjamin Chaires who laid out and named the area of Jacksonville in 1822. Chaires is also listed as a voter in First Florida Election of 1845.

During Florida's Territorial Period (1821-1845). Green A. Chaires along with brothers Benjamin of Vendura Plantation and Thomas Peter of Woodlawn Plantation
moved to Leon County establishing very large plantations. Green Chaires' first plantation started large and eventually grew to 20,000 acres and had a large home on Lake Lafayette. During the 2nd Seminole War of 1835-1842, Chaires' wife and two of his children along with several slaves were massacred and the home was destroyed.

Aside from being a plantation owner, Green Chaires built the state's first plank road, which connected Leon County plantations to the Gulf Coast shipping communities of Newport and St. Marks. Also on the transportation end, Chaires was on the 1861-1865 Board of Directors of the Tallahassee Railroad.

<doc id="8844569" title="Rubloff Company" nonfiltered="627" processed="619" dbindex="1480632">
Rubloff Real Estate is one of Chicago's largest and oldest real estate companies. Established in 1930, the founder, Arthur Rubloff, is known as  the man who changed the face of Chicago.  His pioneering ideas were catalysts for developments that brought a new splendor to Chicago s city skyline. He is credited with coining the nickname Magnificent Mile for the section of North Michigan Avenue that includes the corporate headquarters of Rubloff Residential Properties, in the  Mag Mile  building on 980 North Michigan Avenue.  Arthur Rubloff was responsible for some of the most notable and successful real estate developments in Chicago, including Carl Sandburg Village, The Brunswick Building, the Greyhound Bus Terminal, and Evergreen Plaza Shopping Center. Rubloff was involved in hundreds of real estate deals during his career that helped to shape the city of Chicago. Arthur Rubloff died in 1986 at the age of 83. The company he built ultimately outlasted him and continued to grow.

Rubloff grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, establishing its presence in twelve metropolitan areas, including; Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Detroit, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Cincinnati and Cleveland.   
In 1993 Rubloff sold its commercial operations including Rubloff Development Group, Inc and concentrated its efforts on tackling Chicago's residential sector. In 1996 Howard Weinstein and Tom Horwich became co-owners. Today, Rubloff operates out of seven different offices, covering areas including the North Shore, Lincoln Park, the Gold Coast, the South Loop and Harbor Country in Michigan. In 2006 Rubloff had gross revenues of $1.35 billion. 

Rubloff Residential Properties has always been regarded as an innovator in real estate marketing. For example, Rubloff was the first Chicago real estate firm to market properties via the World Wide Web in 1994, and its web site, http://www.rubloff.com, won a Webby Award in 2006 for its innovative design.  Rubloff remains a privately held company and has a joint venture relationship with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.

<doc id="1067117" title="This Ugly Yet Beautiful World" nonfiltered="628" processed="620" dbindex="1480633">




 is an anime and manga series by Gainax, by the same staff team that worked on Mahoromatic. It deals with the mass extinctions that have occurred on earth in the past. It takes this subject and shows a very interesting possibility for how it might happen today, if the basics of the story are to be believed. In doing this it touches at the love we show for others in different forms, from boyfriend-girlfriend to the love within our families. Due to this more or less constant push on relationships, this anime fits best in the moé (cute girls, romance) genre. 

Story.
Two young high school boys, Takeru and Ryo, are struggling through teenage angst when a mysterious light in the woods offers forth a young girl practically out of Takeru's dreams. They are promptly attacked by a strange alien-looking monster, which is defeated when Takeru mysteriously and spontaneously transforms into a powerful and strange looking beast himself. Not much is clear about the girl, who they name Hikari (Light), but she is more than a little bit strange. Without a memory or a past, the girl is integrated into the lives of the two boys and their families. She knows only her love for Takeru. Most of the group live in a type of group home, along with Jennifer Portman, a drunken American super-scientist who can't keep her hands off the boys and has her own theories about what Hikari is. The series follows them as they hang-out, go to school, and take trips, and all the while Hikari, and also later her "sister" Akari, learn about the human condition. They are also joined by a shape-shifting robot called Ioneos, apparently loyal to Hikari, and Kuon, a little floating alien. They also encounter more strange monsters on occasion. The series spirals towards a rather unexpected climax questioning the value of human life, relationships, love, and the spirit of survival shown by all life on Earth.

Main characters.
Takeru - Takemoto Takeru is this series' main character.  He appears lazy and unmotivated, but is really just unsure of his place in the world. He was the one to find and name Hikari in the first episode. He can transform into a powerful being with superstrength and sharp appendages. Voiced by: Takahiro Mizushima (Japanese), Braden Hunt (English).
Hikari - Hikari is a girl who Takeru finds in the forest and falls in love with in the first episode. Not much is known about her currently, however.   Voiced by: Ayako Kawasumi (Japanese), Cynthia Martinez (English).
Ryo - Ninomiya Ryo is Takeru's best friend and is something of a ladies' man, and is consistently called 'Ro-baby' by Sakurako and Amika. He has some sort of power over the elements. Voiced by: Fujiko Takimoto (Japanese), Quentin Haag (English).
Akari - Akari is a young girl that appears just as mysteriously as Hikari. Ryo finds her and makes her part of his family.  Voiced by: Ai Shimizu (Japanese), Jessica Boone (English).
Mari - Nishino Mari is Takeru's cousin. She has a habit of always nagging at Takeru for various reasons, and often the two are at odd ends. Despite this, she appears to have fallen in love with him, and is very envious of his relationship with Hikari. Voiced by: Asami Sanada (Japanese), Luci Christian (English).

Supporting Characters.
Jennifer Portman - Jennifer Portman is a crazy American super-scientist who came to Japan for reasons yet unknown (most likely due to events in the first episode), and is currently boarding with Takeru, Hikari, and Mari. So far, she has yet to be seen without some kind of alcohol.

Shinichi and Daijirou- Shinichi Asakura and Daijirou Matsumura are two rather strange boys. They seem to always be dreaming up some kind of perverted fantasy, especially once they met Hikari. They even made the rather comical allusion to a 'Sailor Hikari' type scenario. ;

Sumie and Itchou - Itchou and Sumie Nishino are Takeru's aunt and uncle, and the parents of Mari. They took in Takeru when his mother abandoned him at a young age. Currently, they run two business ventures: One of which is a delivery business for various items, and the other is renting out their place as a boarding service for extended periods of time.

Kuon - Kuon is the name of the little creature that takes care of Akari.  He looks like a specter with 2 luminous eyes but no defined body shape, except by his clothing.  He is capable of levitation and apparently has some sharp tentacles, as he is seen carrying a watermelon with these tentacles which he later uses to remove the rind from the watermelon.  There is a marked similarity between Kuon and Marie from Please Teacher.

 Ioneos - Ioneos is like Kuon's 'Older Brother', as he and Kuon are created from the same type of magical crystal. However, Ioneos' appearance and size are much larger and sleek than Kuon's because he is comprised of an entire crystal, save a small chipped fragment which Kuon is made from. He was sealed inside of one of the School's stone pillars, until Hikari released him during a routine fire drill. The entire school was subsequently demolished after the blast following Ioneos' release. He resides with Takeru, Ryo, Hikari and Mari in Takeru's boarding house. His powers appear to be that of shape shifting and melding with objects, as seen when he appears on the car roof, preventing Hkari from fallng from the speeding vehicle and also acting as a barrier between a natural hot spring that he accidentally uncovered during the group's mountain excursion. Ioneos enjoys drinking, and he sometimes becomes irrational after too many drinks. Jennifer nicknamed him 'Neos', saying that his original name was too long.

Trivia.
In the second episode, a reference is made between Hikari and Mizuho Kazami from Please Teacher both being aliens.  Also, there is a resemblance between Kuon and Marie from Please Teacher! Lum in Urusei Yatsura also appears in the episode.

In the closing credits, many of the English voice actors have fake names.  For example, Mari (who is voiced by Luci Christian) is listed in the credits as being voiced by "Tabitha Hickey" and the Narrator is listed as "Eileen Dover.";

<doc id="374899" title="François-Joseph Talma" nonfiltered="629" processed="621" dbindex="1480634">

François Joseph Talma (January 15, 1763 - 1826) was a French actor.

He was born in Paris.  His father, a dentist, moved to London, gave him a good English education.  He returned to Paris, where for a year and a half he practised dentistry. His predilection for the stage was cultivated in amateur theatricals, and on November 21, 1787 he made his debut at the Comédie-Française as Seide in Voltaire's Mahomet. His efforts from the first won approval, but for a considerable time he only obtained secondary parts.

It was as a juvenile lead that he first came to prominence, and he only gradually achieved his unrivalled position as the exponent of strong and concentrated passion. Talma was among the earliest advocates of realism in scenery and costume, being aided by his friend, the painter Jacques-Louis David. His first step in this direction was to appear in the small role of Proculus in Voltaire's Brutus, with a toga and Roman headdress, much to the surprise of an audience accustomed to 18th century costume on stage, regardless of whether or not it suited the part played.

Talma possessed the physical gifts to enable him to excel, a striking appearance and a voice of beauty and power, which he gradually trained to perfection. At first somewhat stilted and monotonous in his manner, he came to be regarded as a model of simplicity. Talma married Julie Carreau, a rich and talented lady whose salon attracted the principal Girondists. The actor was an intimate friend of Napoleon Bonaparte, who delighted in his society, and even, on his return from Elba, forgave him for performing before Louis XVIII. In 1808 the emperor had taken him to Erfurt and made him play the Mort de Cesar to a company of crowned heads. Five years later he took him to Dresden.

Talma was also a friend of Joseph Chénier, Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins and other revolutionists. It was in Chenier's anti-monarchical Charles IX, produced on November 4 1789, that a prophetic couplet on the destruction of the Bastille made the house burst into a salvo of applause, led by Mirabeau. This play was responsible for the political dissensions in the Comédie-Française which resulted in the establishment, under Talma, of a new theatre.

Testudo et Lepus (The Tortoise and the Hare) is the fourth episode of the second season of the television series Rome.



Plot Summary.
Atia turns the tables on Servilia; Octavian wins a battle; Vorenus learns of his children's fate.


HBO summary

Historical and cultural background.
Atia's torturing of Duro was based on Roman law, whereby a slave's testimony would not be accepted unless the slave was tortured.
Cicero's comments to Agrippa may be a reference to Cicero's term as consul in 63 BC. Cicero, in defending the republic against the Catiline conspiracy had several conspirators executed without trial.  Summary executions of citizens was a violation of Roman law, but Cicero maintained that he was acting under "senatus consultum de re publica defendenda", tantamount to a declaration of martial law, so no trial was necessary.

John Russell Taylor (born in Dover on June 19, 1935 and educated at Dover Grammar School and Cambridge University) is an English critic and author, who graduated from Cambridge University.  He has been a prolific writer on cinema, art, theatre and television from the late 1950s onwards.

In the 1960s he wrote on cinema for Sight and Sound and the Monthly Film Bulletin, the theatre in Plays and Players, television for The Listener and various subjects for the Times Literary Supplement.  From the late 1950s he began writing anonymously on television and theatre for The Times, and by 1962 he had become the paper's film critic, initially anonymous but later named after the paper abandoned its "anonymity rule" in January 1967 when William Rees-Mogg became editor.  During this era he wrote a number of books including Anger and After: A Survey of the New British Drama (1962), Anatomy of a Television Play (also 1962, written about the Armchair Theatre production Afternoon of a Nymph), Cinema Eye, Cinema Ear: Some Key Film-Makers of the Sixties (1964) and The Art Nouveau Book in Britain (1966).

In the early 1970s he wrote the book Second Wave: British Drama for the Seventies, a follow-up to Anger and After.  In 1972 he moved to California to become a university lecturer on film - he intended to stay for only one semester, with his original plan being to return to Britain and continue as The Times film critic, but he decided in early 1973 to take up the job on a permanent basis.  While in the United States he continued to contribute to The Times, as well as its near-namesakes the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, and wrote the 1975 book Directors and Directions: Cinema for the Seventies.

Around this time he became very close to Alfred Hitchcock, and he was to become the director's official biographer.  In 1978, when this biography was published, John Russell Taylor returned to Britain where he promptly became The Times art critic, which he would remain until 2005.  Since then he has been an occasional contributor to the paper.  He was also editor of Films and Filming magazine from 1983 until its closure in 1990.  He has written books on Alec Guinness, Orson Welles, Vivien Leigh and Ingrid Bergman, and the 1983 work Strangers in Paradise: The Hollywood Emigres 1933-1950, as well as a number of books on art subjects.

<doc id="2111826" title="Kickoff (American football)" nonfiltered="634" processed="626" dbindex="1480639">
A kickoff is a method of starting or restarting play in American football.

Award.
A kickoff occurs at the start of each half and before each overtime. It is also traditionally decided by a coin toss at the beginning of each game carried out by the referee. The visiting team captain calls either heads or tails. If he is right, he gets to choose whether to receive the ball or to kick off. If an overtime is required, another coin toss takes place to decide who gets first possession during the overtime. After a touchdown or field goal, there is also a kickoff with the team being scored against receiving. There is a special "free kick" after a safety.

Procedure.
The ball is to be placed between the kicking team's goal line and their own 30-yard line (35-yard line in Canadian football and in college football). All players on the kicking team must not cross the line at which the ball is placed until the ball is kicked. The receiving team must stay behind the line that is 10 yards from where the ball is placed. The ball can be fielded by the receiving team at any point after it has been kicked or by the kicking team after it has travelled 10 yards or has been touched by a member of the receiving team. If it is fielded by the kicking team, it is called an onside kick. A low, bouncing kick is called a squib kick. Although a squib kick typically gives the receiving team better field position than they would if a normal kick had been used, a squib kick is sometimes used to avoid giving up a long return, as well as to give the kicking team the best chance of recovering the ball, typically when behind near the end of the game.

Penalties.

If a receiving player crosses the 40-yard line before the kick, the ball is to be advanced 5 yards, then re-kicked. If a kicking team player crosses the line at which the ball is placed before it is kicked, a loss of 5 yards is incurred and a re-kick takes place. If the ball goes out of bounds without being touched by a player, the receiving team can choose either to have the ball moved back 10 yards and re-kicked, to take the ball at their own 40 yard line, or to take the ball where it went out of bounds. However, if a kick does not go ten yards out of bounds, the kicking team will take a 5-yard penalty and has the chance to kick another onside kick. If the onside goes out of bounds again the receiving team will receive the ball at the spot the ball went out of bounds. Should the ball go out of bounds in the receiving team's endzone or is recovered and downed in the receiving team's end zone, the ball is to be placed at the receiving team's 20-yard line (25-yard line in Canadian football) and possession is given to the receiving team (this is known as a touchback). Recovering the ball outside the endzone and then downing it inside the endzone results in a safety.

<doc id="7103142" title="Ma Zhanshan" nonfiltered="636" processed="628" dbindex="1480641">
Ma Zhanshan (1885-1950,    ) was born in Gongzhuling, in Jilin province, in a poor farm family. At the age of 20 he became a security guard of Huaide County.  Promoted to Guard Monitor of the 4th Security Guard Battalion for his good marksmanship and equestrianism, by Wu Junsheng, Commander of Tianhou Road Patrol and Defence Battalion of Mukden in 1908.  

In 1913, Ma was appointed as Major Company Commander of 3rd Company, of the 3rd Regiment, 2nd Brigade of the Central Cavalry Army in the Army of the Republic of China.  In 1920, he was promoted to Colonel who and followed his patron, Warlord Wu Junsheng.

He started his military career in Zhang Zuolin's northeastern army, serving as a brigade commander of 5th Cavalry Brigade, 17th Cavalry Division then as brigader of 3rd Infantry Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army.  After Zhang's death in 1928 Ma was nominated  as Heilongjiang Provincial Bandit Suppression Commander and Heilongjiang Provincial Cavalry Commander-in-chief in 1928.

After the Mukden Incident, when the Japanese invaded the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, the Chairman Wan Fulin of Heilongjiang Province was in Peiping, nobody was there to lead the province with the danger of invasion threatening. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Nanjing Government to ask for instructions, and then appointed Ma Zhanshan to act as Chairman of Heilongjiang Province and Military Commander-in-chief of Heilongjiang Province October 10th 1931. Ma Zhanshan arrived in the capital Tsitsihar on October 19th and took office the next day. He held military meetings and personally inspected the defence positions while facing down the party who wished to surrender and refused inducements to surrender from the Japanese army, saying  I am appointed as Chairman of the province, and I have the responsibility to defend the province and I will never be a surrendering general .

The Japanese invaders repeatedly demanded to repair the Nenjiang River Bridge, that had been dynamited in earlier civil strife to prevent an advance by a rival Chinese general. These demands were all refused by Ma Zhanshan.  The Japanese, determined to repair the bridge sent a Japanese repair crew, guarded by 800 Japanese soldiers.  Nearby were 2,500 Chinese troops and a clash ensued.  Each side charged the other with opening fire without provocation, and thus began the Jiangqiao Campaign. Although eventually forced to withdraw his troops in the face of Japanese tanks and artillery, Ma became a national hero for his resistance to the Japanese which was reported in the Chinese and international press. Ting Chao and other senior commanders followed Ma's example at the industrial city of Harbin in Jilin province and elsewhere.  His troops inspired the people of Northeast China, to aid or enlist in volunteer forces. On November 18th, Ma Zhanshan evacuated Tsitsihar.  By November 19th, Ma Zhanshan led his troops to the east to defend Baiquan and Hailun.  After the General Ting Chao was driven from Harbin, Ma's forces suffered serious casualties and were soon driven over the Soviet border. 

Because of his fame and heroics fighting them, the Japanese decided to recruit Ma Zhanshan to fight for them.  Colonel Kenji Doihara, made contact with Ma and offered him a huge sum to join the Manchukoan Army. He offered to tour the country and reconcile the Chinese of the northeast to their rule. He flew to Shenyang in January 1932, where he attended the meeting that founded the puppet state of Manchukuo. Ma was ill at that time thus avoiding signing the Independence Declaration of Manchukuo. He attended the inaugural ceremony of Pu Yi as emperor of Manchukuo in March the same year, and he was appointed as War Minister of Manchukuo and Governor of Heilongjiang Province. However, the Japanese invaders put very strict control on him, he had to ask approval from his Japanese advisor about all matters of the province before implementating them.

Ma intended to rebel after secretly using the Japanese money to raise and reequip his new volunteer force. When he was appointed as the Governor of Heilongjiang, he secretly transported weapons and ammunition out of the arsenals and evacuated the wives and families of his troops to safety. He then led his troops from Qiqihar on April 1 with the excuse of an army inspection.  At Heihe on April 7th he announced the reestablishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and continued to resist the Japanese.  Ma reorganized the former puppet troops into 9 brigades at the beginning of May, and then he established another 11 troops of volunteers at Buxi, Gannan, Keshan, Kedong and other places and thus established the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army with Ma appointed as Commander-in-chief, at least nominally, over the other volunteer armies, commanding a total fighting force of about 300,000 men at its peak strength. 

The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army units under Ma undertook ambushes along the major roads and badly mauled Manchukuoan and Japanese troops. In the Ma Chan-shan Subjugation Operation the Japanese Kwangtung Army transferred a large mixed force of Japanese and Manchukuoan troops to encircle and destroy Ma's Army. Ma Zhanshan's troops though seriously depleted in the fierce battles escaped due to the laxity of the puppet troops.  In September Ma Zhanshan arrived in Longmen County and established relationship with the Anti-Japanese Army of Su Bingwen.  In the Su Ping-wei Subjugation Operation, 30,000 Japanese and Manchukuoan troops made attacks on the volunteer forces forcing Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen to retreat into the Soviet Union in December. Most of these troops were then then transferred to Rehe.  

Ma himself stayed abroad in Russia, Germany and Italy only returning in June 1933, and went to Jiang Jieshi ask for armies to resist the Japanese but failed. He then settled in Tianjin until October 1936 when Jiang Jieshi suddenly sent him to the front of the Civil War. At Xi'an at the time of Xian Incident, he suggested to Zhang Xueliang not to kill Jiang Jieshi while the country was in trouble and signed on the Current Political Situation Declaration issued by Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng as well. Zhang Xueliang appointed Ma Zhanshan as the Commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Aid Suiyuan Cavalry Group Army, which was suspended afterwards when Zhang Xueliang was detained by Jiang Jieshi.

After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Zhanshan was appointed as Commander of the Northeastern Advance Force in charge of the  four northeastern provinces Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Rehe. Ma Zhanshan established Headquarters in Datong in August 1937 and led his troops to fight the Japanese in Chahar, Suiyuan, Datong and Shanxi Area and he cooperated with Fu-Zuyi's troops in the defence of Suiyuan and in the Yinshan War.

Ma Zhanshan abhorred the nonresistance policy of the Kuomintang and he agreed with the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation aims of the Communist Party expressed during communications with the Communist Party.  He visited Yanan in 1939 in order to look for a way to carry out Anti-Japanese and National Salvation efforts.  Ma Zhanshan was appointed as Chairman of the government of Heilongjiang in August of 1940 that he held to the end of the war.  He then started to undertake Anti-Japanese and National Salvation activities. 

After the victory of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Government of the Republic of China appointed Ma Zhanshan as Northeast Deputy Security Commander. He took office in Shenyang, but a half year later he retired to his home in Beijing saying he was ill. He crossed over to the Communist Party in January 1949 after persuading Gen. Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan in Beijing, to allow Beijing to be taken bloodlessly by the Communists.  After the founding of the People's Republic, Chairman Mao Zedong invited him to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in June 1950, but he failed to attend because of illness and he died the same year on November 29th, 1950, in Beijing.

<doc id="1051" title="Alexis Carrel" nonfiltered="637" processed="629" dbindex="1480642">

Alexis Carrel (June 28, 1873 - November 5, 1944) was a French surgeon, biologist and eugenicist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912. He was also a member of Jacques Doriot's Parti Populaire Français (PPF), the most collaborationist party during Vichy France.

 Biography .
Born in Lyon, Carrel practiced in France and in the United States at the University of Chicago and the Rockefeller Institute. He developed new techniques in vascular sutures and was a pioneer in transplantology and thoracic surgery. Alexis Carrel was also a member of learned societies in the U.S., Spain, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from Queen's University of Belfast, Princeton University, California, New York, Brown University and Columbia University. He collaborated with American physician Charles Claude Guthrie in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs, and Carrel was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these efforts. Due to his membership of the collaborationist PPF and of his role in implementing eugenics policies during Vichy France, he was accused after the war of collaborationism, but died before the trial.
stinky
 Contributions to science .

On January 17, 1912, Carrel placed a part of chicken's embryo heart in fresh nutrient medium in a stoppered Pyrex flask of his design. Every 48 hours the tissue doubled in size and was transferred to a new flask. The tissue was still growing 20 years later, longer than a chicken's normal lifespan.

During the First World War (1914-1918), Carrel and the English chemist Henry Drysdale Dakin developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with sutures, which prior to the development of widespread antibiotics, was a major medical progress. For this, Carrel was awarded the Légion d'honneur.
        
He co-authored a book with famed pilot Charles A. Lindbergh, The Culture of Organs, and worked with Lindbergh in the mid-1930s to create the "perfusion pump," which allowed living organs to exist outside of the body during surgery. The advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of open-heart surgery and organ transplants, and to have laid the groundwork for the artificial heart, which became a reality decades later. Some critics of Lindbergh claimed that Carrel overstated Lindbergh's role to gain media attention, but other sources say Lindbergh played an important role in developing the device.  Both Lindbergh and Carrel appeared on the cover of Time magazine on June 13, 1938.

In 1972, the Swedish Post Office honored Carrel with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series. In 1979, the lunar crater Carrel was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs.now he is dead

 Relation to eugenics and fascism .

In 1935, Carrel published a best-selling book titled L'Homme, cet inconnu (Man, This Unknown) which advocated, in part, that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group intellectuals, and by implementing a regime of enforced eugenics. Sociologist Roger Caillois quoted and paraphrased L'Homme, cet inconnu in The Edge of Surrealism: " '(p)resent-day proletarians owe their status to inherited intellectual and physical defects'  (sancta simplicitas). And heggggsdfasd  suggests that this state of affairs should be accenetuated through appropriate measures, so as to correlate social and biological inequalities more precisely. Society would then be directed by a hereditary aristocracy composed of descendants from the Crusaders, the heroes of the Revolution, the great criminals, the financial and industrial magnates" (p. 360).  

Carrel advocated the use of gas chambers to rid humanity of "inferior stock", thus endorsing the scientific racism discourse. His endorsement of this idea began in the mid-1930s, prior to the Nazi implementation of such practices in Germany. In the 1936 German introduction of his book, at the publishers request, he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages: "(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous." Carrel also wrote: "(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts.".  While these statements do not neccessarily endorse forced euthanasia against individuals innocent of what Carrel considered dangerous anti-social behaviour, and the statement in the German edition of his book was written three years before the Nazi regime enacted the infamous T-4 Euthanasia Program, his views and affiliations remain highly controversial.

In 1937, Carrel joined Jean Coutrot s Centre d Etudes des Problèmes Humains - Coutrot s aim was to develop what he called an "economic humanism" through "collective thinking." In 1941, through connections to the Pétain cabinet (specifically, French industrial physicians André Gros and Jacques Ménétrier) he went on to advocate for the creation of the Fondation Française pour l Etude des Problèmes Humains (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems) which was created by decree of the collaborationist Vichy regime in 1941, and where he served as 'regent'. The foundation was at the origine of the October 11, 1946 law instauring occupational medicine. It worked on demographics (Robert Gessain, Paul Vincent, Jean Bourgeois), on nutrition (Jean Sutter), on habitation (Jean Merlet) and on the first opinion polls (Jean Stoetzel). "The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health. It was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs roughly one franc per inhabitant a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation s resources. By way of comparison, the whole Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) was given a budget of fifty million francs." 

According to Gwen Terrenoire, writing in Eugenics in France (1913-1941) : a review of research findings, "The foundation was a pluridisciplinary centre that employed around 300 researchers (mainly statisticians, psychologists, physicians) from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944. After the liberation of Paris, Carrel was suspended by the Minister of Health; he died in November 1944, but the Foundation itself was "purged", only to reappear in a short time as the Institut national d études démographiques (INED) that is still active." Although Carrel himself died on November 5, 1944, most members of his team did move to the INED, which was led by famous demographist Alfred Sauvy, who coined the expression "Third World". Others joined Robert Debré's "Institut national d'hygiène" (National Hygiene Institute), which later became the INSERM.

Some scholars, such as Lucien Bonnafé, Patrick Tort and Max Lafont have accused Carrel of responsibility for the execution of thousands of mentally ill or impaired patients under Vichy. They argue that this policy was inspired by Carrel's advocacy of eugenics. 

Carrel's association with Vichy, and the harshness of his advocacy for eugenics, has led to his descent from fame to obscurity. In recent years, Jean-Marie le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National party ("National Front"), has become an advocate for Carrel, referring to him as "the first environmentalist, or, if you will, the first modern ecologist, precisely because he committed himself to defining the relationships of natural harmony.". His writings on eugenics are studied "avidly in the training camps of the National Front".

In the 1990s, the attention the National Front's support brought to Carrel's fascist associations and controversial views created a series of controversies with respect to streets and institutions named in honor of Carrel. Over 20 French cities and towns, including Paris, renamed streets previously named for Carrel. The controversy came to a head in Lyon, his birhtplace, where the medicine faculty of the university Lyon I-Claude Bernard was named in his honor. Lyon libération questioned the wisdom of this. In response to this, "(i)n May 1995, the Palais des Congrès of Lyon hosted a conference on Carrel and scientific racism at which several of the participants accused the inquiry commission of whitewashing the controversial scientist. In early 1996, after five years of embarrassing publicity, the governing board of the University of Lyon decided to rename its school of medicine after René Laënnec, inventor of the stethoscope."

In the United States as well as in France, the 1990s were not kind to Carrel's reputation. In an interview for PBS' The American Experience, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. blamed Carrel for Charles Lindbergh's increasing racism in the 1930s. Schlesinger stated in response to a question concerning the source of Lindbergh's beliefs on this subject: "I suppose he got a lot of it from Alexis Carrel, the French biologist who had a kind of racial mysticism of a sort."

A fracton is a collective quantized vibration on a substrate with a fractal structure.

Fractons are the fractal analog of phonons. Phonons are the result of applying translational symmetry to the potential in a Schrödinger equation. Fractal self-similarity can be thought of as a symmetry somewhat comparable to translational symmetry. Translational symmetry is symmetry under displacement or change of position, and self-similarity is symmetry under change of scale. The quantum mechanical solutions to such a problem in general lead to a continuum of states with different frequencies. In other words, a fracton band is comparable to a phonon band. The vibrational modes are restricted to part of the substrate and are thus not fully delocalized, unlike phonon vibrational modes. Instead there is a hierarchy of vibrational modes which encompass smaller and smaller parts of the substrate.

Jennie Smillie Robertson (10 February 1878   26 February 1981) was a Canadian physician and the first female surgeon in Canada.

Born Jennie Smillie in Hensall, Ontario, she first became a teacher. She started saving so that she could attend Kingston s Ontario Medical College for Women (which was absorbed into the University of Toronto s medical school in 1906). She graduated in 1909 but no hospital in Toronto would take her for her residency so she had to attend Philadelphia's Women's Medical College. In 1911, she returned to Canada and was the first women in Canada to perform surgery. She was also the first woman to do major gynecological surgery in Canada.

She married Alex Robertson when she was 70.

Edward William Nelson (May 8, 1855 - May 19, 1934) was an American naturalist and ethnologist.

In 1877 Nelson joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Spencer Fullerton Baird was responsible for selecting Signal Officers for the remoter stations, and would choose men with scientific training who were prepared to study the lcoal flora and fauna. Baird sent Nelson to St. Michael, Alaska. 

Nelson was the naturalist on board the USRC Corwin, which sailed to Wrangel Island in search of the USS Jeanette in 1881. Nelson published his findings in the Report upon Natural History Collections Made in Alaska between the Years 1877-1881 (1887). He also published his ethnological findings in The Eskimo about Bering Strait (1900).

In 1890 Nelson accepted an appointment as a Special Field Agent with the Death Valley Expedition under Clinton Hart Merriam, Chief of the Division of Ornithology and Mammalogy, United States Department of Agriculture. After this expedition he was ordered to conduct a field survey in Mexico, and Nelson remained in the country for the next fourteen years. Nelson continued to work for the Bureau of Biological Survey until 1929, being Chief of the Bureau from 1916 to 1927.

Tesco Supermarkets v Nattrass  AC 153 is a leading decision of the House of Lords on the "directing mind" theory of corporate liability.

Background.
Tesco was offering a discount on washing powder which was advertised on posters displayed in stores. Once they ran out of the lower priced product the stores began to replace it with the regularly priced stock.One manager omitted to take the signs down and a customer was charged at the higher price. Tesco was charged under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 for falsely advertising the price of washing powder. In its defence Tesco argued that the manager had taken all reasonable precautions and all due diligence, and that the conduct of the manager could not attach liability to the corporation.

Opinion of the Court.
The House of Lords accepted the defence and found that the manager was not a "directing mind" of the corporation and therefore his conduct was not attributable to the corporation. The corporation had done all it could to enforce the rules regarding advertising.
 
Lord Reid held that "The person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company."

<doc id="258997" title="Walmer Castle" nonfiltered="642" processed="634" dbindex="1480647">
 Walmer Castle was built by Henry VIII in 1539-1540 as an artillery fortress to counter the threat of invasion from Catholic France and Spain. It was one of three forts constructed to defend the Downs, an area of safe anchorage protected by the Goodwin Sands, in Kent, south east England. The other forts were at Deal and Sandown.

Design.
At the centre of Walmer Castle is a circular keep, surrounded by an open courtyard and protected by a concentric wall, from which four, squat, semi-circular bastions project. The northern bastion forms the gatehouse and would have had a gun on its roof; the other bastions would have had guns mounted inside them and on the roof. The central keep would also have had guns mounted on its roof giving the castle the capacity to mount 39 guns. A gallery running around the castle at basement level has 32 loops for hand-guns covering the moat.

History.
Tudors and Stuarts.
The defences were never put to the test during the Tudor period and it wasn't until 1648, during the English Civil War, that the castle finally came under siege. The three 'castles of the Downs' were initially held for Parliament, but the forces switched allegiance to support the Royalist cause. It took Parliamentary forces, led by Colonel Rich, nearly three months to defeat the three castles, with Walmer surrendering first after a three week siege.

Lord Warden's residence & gardens.
In 1708 Walmer Castle took on a new role as the residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Cinque Ports Confederation originated in the 11th century when the five ports of Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich joined forces to provide ships and men for the defence of the coast and protection of cross-channel trade. In return for these services they received substantial local privileges including immunity from all external courts of justice and from national taxation. In the 13th century the office of Warden was instituted to oversee and regulate the affairs of the Confederation. Initially this position carried real power, but with the forming of a Royal Navy and the decline of the Cinque Ports, the role of Warden became more of an honorary position bestowed to those who had given distinguished service to the state.

Over the years successive Wardens converted the fort and its grounds into a comfortable country house and gardens. Resident Wardens included William Pitt the Younger (whose niece Lady Hester Stanhope initiated the gardens, using labour from the local militia), the Duke of Wellington (who died here), Sir Winston Churchill and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Memorabilia from these past Wardens, including two rooms dedicated to the Duke of Wellington, can be viewed at the castle.

Circle WarsTM was the mind-child of Pytho7, renowned software designer, in summer holidays of 2006. It is a simple computer game created using Visual Basic 6, and took over a month to make. It is similar to the Nintendo 64 game Super Smash Brothers, as the aim of the game is to damage all opponents and push them off the board, until there is one eventual winner.

 Features of the Game .

Circle Wars contains many advanced features
 The game can accommodate up to 4 players, the result of an extensive array of keys available to be used. This allows for more fun, with many players and spectators getting in on the game's action.
 The game includes real time physics, with advanced collision detection, gravity and momentum all included in the game's programming, allowing for more realistic game-play.
 Before commencing the action, users can choose from between 1 and 15 lives per character, which provides the option of changing the length of the game.
 Once all but one of the characters are defeated, a final screen appears, announcing the triumphant player. It offers different options, to restart or to change some of the parameters.

 The Characters .

Each of the 4 characters of the game have their own distinct properties:
 The Purple Guy - the Purple Guy has the ability of magic, with his special moves both including blue-manna material to do damage. He is a good character to do long range damage with, but his secondary move requires much precision.
 The Orange Guy - this character possesses the quality karate , with both of his special moves using his hands. His ability to shoot out his hand is sometimes the defining factor when enemies are retreating or far away.
 The White Guy - also known as the Flying Guy, this character can fly around the board by holding down the jump button. As he only has one special move, his ability to quickly leave the area of action can be essential during gameplay.
 The Yellow Guy - the Yellow Guy is so coloured after his theme of electricity, and he has two electrical-related moves. His secondary move does not move enemies much, but when accompanied with his primary move can deal serious damage.

 Credits .

Circle WarsTM was created in association with H-Dub and the H-Dub Beeper.

Two of a Kind is a 1983 movie starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

The film has Travolta as an inventor and Newton-John as a bank teller.  It is up to both criminally-minded individuals to save the Earth from God's destruction.

This film was the pop singer Newton-John's third attempt at a big budget movie, but which turned out to be an even bigger bomb than her previous Xanadu.  This film also marked the start of a huge downturn in Travolta's movie career, which wouldn't rebound until 1994 with his starring role in Pulp Fiction.  This film was the antithesis of Travolta's and Newton-John's previous film together, Grease, one of the biggest box office successes in movie history.

The Airjaldi Mesh network, situated in and around Dharamsala, India, is one of the world's largest mesh technology wireless networks, covering hundreds of square kilometers of mountainous terrain in the Himachal foothills of the Western Himalayas. 

 The Airjaldi Service .

AirJaldi serves thousands of people in towns and villages scattered around Dharamsala, the headquarters of the Tibetan government in exile. The establishment of the Tibetan communities in India has been made possible by the government of India. AirJaldi was developed in cooperation with the Dharamsala Information Technology Group (DITG), an organization chaired by the Tibetan Computer Resource Center (TCRC) and some of the region s leading information technology professionals. The network is the first project by the The Tibetan Technology Center, or TibTec, a charitable organization dedicated to harnessing modern technology and assisting the Tibetan community in India. The center is located at the Tibetan Children's Villages School (TCV) which hosts and supports it.

 2006 Summit .

Tibtec hosted the AirJaldi Summit, 22-25 October, 2006. The Summit conference was followed by a series of workshops and meetings of professionals and experts in the art of building and maintaining rural wireless networks. The workshops were organised by WSFII, an ongoing international process of multiple, local action oriented events which provide space for people to come together, to share experiences, present practical solutions, to learn and to build, all kinds of Free Information Infrastructures. His Holiness the Dalai Lama, spiritual head of the Tibetan people, has endorsed the Summit, giving it his blessings. 

The focus of this year's Summit is why, when and how to build wireless networks in the developing world, seen by many as the major contribution of ICT to instituting positive change for the world's poorest and most disadvantaged peoples.

The keynotes were by:
 Dr. Roger Downer, President Emeritus of the University of Limerick, Ireland;
 Dave Hughes, longstanding wireless technologies advocate; and;
 Vic Hayes, the father of WiFi;

Other speakers included Dr. Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation and Prof. Eric Brewer of the University of California.

Speakers for the event covered subjects ranging from Elements of Rural Wireless Internet Access; Low-cost Wireless Networks   Basics of Technology and Financing; Business Models for Community Wireless Networking; and, Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D). Additionally, the World Summits on Free Information Infrastructures has arranged for expert workshop trainers to lead a ten-day, hands on workshop for summit attendees who want practical training in wireless and other technologies. 
  
There has been a stir of interest globally in the Summit, with online articles in Wired magazine and BoingBoing. There are also moves to support the Summit with resources to document and disseminate the learnings as rapidly as possible following the event. Wireless networking enables the growth of connected communities, a phenomenon not possible before the advent of modern data-centric communication. Bringing this capability into developing countries, evangelising its spread, and creating a movement for sustainable growth of such community networks, together with related socially egalitarian activities, is made possible because of the pioneering work done to build AirJaldi and other such networks elsewhere in the world.

<doc id="642196" title="Francis II, Duke of Brittany" nonfiltered="652" processed="644" dbindex="1480657">

Francis II (in French François II) (June 23 1433   September 9 1488), was duke of Brittany, from 1458 to his death. He was son of Richard count d'Etampes and grandson of Duke John V. Francis' life was characterised by conflicts with the crown of France, ruled by king Louis XI of Valois (War of the Public Weal), and especially his son Charles VIII.

Francis II married twice, first to his cousin Margaret, heiress of Brittany, daughter of Francis I, then to Margaret of Foix, princess of Navarre. Only one daughter, Anne of Brittany, from his second marriage, survived to adulthood.

During the minority of Charles VIII of France, Francis II aligned himself with the Duke of Orleans and the count of Angouleme, against the regency of Anne of France.  His attention to the internal politics of his neighbour France made him neglect his own affairs. Brittany's prime-minister Monsieur de Landois was an oppressive and corrupt man and his actions caused a major open revolt. The minor nobles and the people of Brittany were supported by the crown of France, eager to get even with Francis II. Unable to get help from Brittany's traditional allies, the English (by then Richard III of England was having enough of his own problems   see Wars of the Roses)   Francis saw his duchy ravaged and Landois hanged by the infuriated people in what is known as the Mad War (La Guerre Folle). Even without Landois in power, the Bretons remained suspicious of their duke. Nevertheless, in 1486, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the succession of Brittany on Francis' daughter Anne, to assure independence from France. 

The Treaty of Chateaubriant, signed in 1487 with France, reassured Brittany's independence, but the French continued to harass the duchy. Francis then allied with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor against France, to tone down the offensives. The move did not result according to plan and once again, Brittany was ravaged. In July 28 Brittany was defeated in the battle of Saint Aubin du Cormier. A few days later, on August 10, Francis was forced to sign the Peace of Verger. In the terms of the treaty, the duke was compelled to recognise himself and his duchy as a vassal of the king of France.

Francis II died shortly afterwards, following a fall from his horse during a leisure ride. After his death, Charles VIII invaded Brittany and forced the heiress Anne to marry him, thus succeeding in the control of the duchy.

High-end audio equipment is purported by the manufacturers to be the best, regardless of the price. High-end audio equipment can be extremely expensive. It is sometimes referred to as cost-no-object equipment.  Owners of high-end audio are either audiophiles or conspicuous consumers.  Audiophiles run the gamut from budget to high-end in terms of equipment price range and are primarily concerned with the quality of music reproduction (accuracy with personal preferences).  

 Definition of 'high end' .

High-end audio can refer to the build quality of the components, but more specifically, refers to the ability to reproduce a recording with the highest fidelity to the original performance that has been committed to the recording. Typical qualitative attributes that are scaled by audiophile publications and experts are accuracy vs. warmth, tonal color vs. speed, timbre, size of sound stage vs. depth (spatial origins), clarity, pace, timing etc, etc.  

A theoretically perfect high-end audio system would create the illusion of the musical performers actually being present and performing right in front of the listener.  There would be no sonic signature that imparts any clue as to the fact that the performance is a playback of a recording instead of a live performance by actual musicians in the listening room.  This is obviously more important with performances involving acoustic instruments and without studio manipulations of vocals.

 Professional recording studios .

Professional recording studios seldom use high-end audio gear for mixing and monitoring recording sessions. Instead, studios use players, amplifiers, signal processors, and speakers that are built to very high standards. These speakers are referred to as studio monitors and are specially crafted to produce very accurate sound, reflecting exactly what is on the recording. Most high-end speakers will tend to add color or tone shaping the music so that it sounds "better". For this reason studio monitors must be used to ensure that changes being made to the audio are accurately represented to the engineer.

Publications that interested parties can peruse include Stereophile (US), Absolute Sound (US), Hifi News (UK) and Hifi + (UK).

César Charlone was a Uruguayan political figure. He was Vice President of Uruguay from 1934 to 1938. His period of office is regarded as controversial, because he served under President Gabriel Terra, who largely circumvented the constitution and ruled by decree.

Charlone was a member of the Uruguayan Colorado Party. The controversial nature of his term of office suggests to some observers that he may be regarded as having largely repudiated the political ideals for which the Colorado party has long stood. Others may recall that Chalone's willingness to identify with Gabriel Terra's rule by decree prefigures the cooperation of leading civilian Colorado party memebers with the civilian-military governments of 1973 to 1985.

Forniphilia is a sub-set of bondage and sexual objectification in which a person's body is incorporated into a chair, table, cabinet or other piece of furniture. 

Allen Jones' sculptures Hat Stand and Table Sculpture, made in 1969, which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, are clear examples of the depiction of the fantasy of sexual objectification. 

Forniphilia is an extreme form of bondage because the subject usually is tightly bound and expected to stay immobile for an indefinite period of time. They are often gagged and/or placed in position where there is a danger of being smothered. It is imperative that the dominant that is putting a subordinate in such peril check their condition every few minutes.

See Orf for other meanings.;

Orf is a disease caused by a parapox virus and occurring primarily in sheep and goats.  It is also known as contagious pustular dermatitis, sore mouth, contagious ecthyma, and scabby mouth.  Orf virus can also infect humans.  The origin of the term orf is from Old English, in which it means rough.

Orf in sheep and goats.
Orf is spread by fomites and direct contact.  Symptoms include papules and pustules on the lips and muzzle, and less commonly in the mouth of young lambs and on the eyelids, feet, and teats of ewes.  The lesions progress to thick crusts which may bleed.  Orf in the mouths of lambs may prevent suckling and cause weight loss.  Sheep are prone to reinfection.  A live virus vaccine is made from scab material and usually given to ewes at the age of two months, but only to lambs when there is an outbreak.  The vaccine can cause disease in humans.

Orf in humans.
Humans can contract the disorder by direct inoculation from the mouth of infected sheep and goats. It causes a purulent-appearing papule locally and generally no systemic symptoms. The papule may persist for 7 to 10 weeks and spontaneously resolves. It is an uncommon condition and not easily identified by most doctors.

While orf is usually a benign self-limiting illness, it can be very progressive and even life-threatening in the immune-compromised host. One percent topical cidofovir has been successfully used in a few patients with progressive disease. Serious damage may be inflicted on the eye if it is infected by Orf, even among healthy individuals.

Anima (Courtney Mason) is a fictional character from DC Comics, who starred in the comic book series of the same name.  The character was created and written by science fiction and fantasy authors Elizabeth Hand and Paul Witcover.

Fictional character biography.
Rebellious teenage runaway Courtney Mason acquired her miraculous powers following an attack by parasitic aliens: one of many New Blood superbeings created in this way, as part of the Bloodlines crossover.  Seven extraterrestrial predators had come to Earth and slaughtered thousands of humans by feeding on their spinal fluids.  On the run in New Orleans, Courtney was kidnapped by a cult that sacrificed her to two of these insatiable parasites, knows as Pritor and Lissik. But Courtney did not die. Instead, the parasites' bites unleashed the Animus, a sentient-energy creature that can absorb the spirit essences of the living and the dead, which was now able to enter the world through Courtney. She became the embodiment of mankind's rage and masculine drive, and quickly developed awesome physical powers of her own. As Anima, Courtney sought revenge against the cult. She also met the Teen Titans and battled a variety of supernatural menaces. Anima remains a wanderer, traveling from place to place and helping those in need by calling upon the fearsome primal force inside her.

Anima featured prominently in DC Comics' Bloodbath limited series (1993), in which all the New Blood characters teamed up to help defeat the alien parasites who had empowered them.  The following year she showed up in Zero Hour.

Anima's own title, beginning December 1993, ran for 15 months before being cancelled due to low sales.  It was an unconventional DC comic book, with the main theme being a war between metaphysical beings who embodied the Jungian archetypes of human psychology - Animus was only one of these.  The series had a huge supporting cast, both human and supernatural - in some issues, Anima herself appeared for only a few pages. Courtney's younger brother Jeremy Mason becomes the channel for Animus' evil sister, Eris (Eris shares her name with a goddess of Greek Mythology, who herself appeared in DC's Wonder Woman title, second series). Animus and Eris ultimately combine as the Syzygy, to fight their father/enemy known only as The Nameless One.  The series featured innumerable pop-culture references, as symbols of the collective unconscious where the archetypal beings dwell. Fellow DC superheroes Superboy and Hawkman also guest-starred - with Superboy temporarily acting as a channel for an archetype called The Warrior.

Since the demise of her title, Anima seems to have been virtually forgotten by DC and has appeared only once or twice.

Trivia.
The character Anima was nominated for the R.A.C. "Squiddy" Award for Favorite Comics Character in 1995, and the Anima comic series was nominated for the R.A.C. "Squiddy" Award for Favorite Ongoing Comics Series in 1995.

<doc id="3777622" title="Grid friendly" nonfiltered="667" processed="659" dbindex="1480672">
 
Note: The term Grid Friendly is trademarked, and refers to energy usage management technology, and the use of energy-efficient products and services, which operate in a manner that supports electrical power grid reliability.  The owner and the trademark are hereby recognized.

The concept of a grid-friendly device is fairly simple, but understanding its purpose and method of action requires an understanding of electric power transmission systems.  There are three principle stimuli currently recognized for grid-friendly response: frequency, voltage, and price.  Grid-friendly devices exhibit one or more of these three responses.  Grid-friendly devices can include major appliances found in homes, commercial building systems such as HVAC, and many industrial systems.

 Frequency Response .

Most electric systems use alternating current with a nominal frequency of 50 or 60 Hz (Hertz) to deliver energy produced by electrical generators to the electricity consumers.  When the amount of electric power produced by the generators exceeds the power used by the customers, the frequency of the electricity rises.  Conversely, when the amount of electric power produced is less than what is consumed, the frequency drops.  Therefore frequency is an accurate indicator of the system-wide (called global) balance between supply and demand.  Without grid-friendly frequency response, the rate at which the frequency changes is dependent principally on the system's total inertia (which is not very controllable) and the aggregate response of the generators' control systems (which can only be controlled relatively slowly).  In contrast, grid-friendly devices can act very quickly.

A grid-friendly device can respond to changes in frequency by reducing or interrupting the demand for electric power (called load) when the frequency drops below a certain threshold, and/or increasing load when the frequency rises.  Although a single grid-friendly device may be a very small load, the fraction of the total load that can be controlled by frequency at any time is usually sufficient to provide under-frequency protection to the system before more drastic measures like black-outs are required.

The advantage of grid-friendly frequency response is that frequency is ubiquitous on an electric system.  When a generator shuts down in one part of the system, all the loads everywhere in the system can simultaneously detect the change and respond instantly and appropriately without the need for a control system to detect the problem, a control center to make a decision, or a telecommunications network to deliver commands to millions of devices.  This type of behavior changes frequency from a simple electrodynamic and control systems input to an emergent property.  While there is still some controversy on the subject, it is believed that complex systems utilizing self-regulation through emergence are generally more resilient and flexible than are simpler top-down command and control systems.

 Voltage Response .

In contrast to frequency, voltage varies widely throughout electric systems, because it is the voltage difference between two devices that largely determines the direction and magnitude of the current (hence the power) that flows between them.  Therefore voltage is a more local phenomenon, and grid-friendly devices that respond to voltage will support more local aspects of the electric delivery system.

 Price Response .

While frequency and voltage respond to physical phenomena on the electric system, grid-friendly price response is designed to address economic phenomena.  With the increasing application of electricity markets to manage the efficient distribution of electric power, more consumers are exposed to electricity prices that change over time, rather than fixed for months or years.  In general, higher prices occur at times when the electric system is running short of supply.  The purpose of grid-friendly price response is to promote demand response among electricity consumers.  Demand response is one means of reducing the market power of electricity suppliers when production runs short.  Grid-friendly response to price also allows consumers to reduce their energy costs by using less electricity when prices are high, and more electricity when prices are low.

Stojkovi  joined Red Star Belgrade at the age of ten, but was initially overshadowed by Vladimir Di¨ljenkovi . Di¨ljenkovi 's graduation to the first team saw Stojkovi  loaned out to gain experience at Bosnia-Herzegovnian side FK Leotar before joining FK Zemun. 

However, with Di¨ljenkovi  switching to Ukrainian side FC Metalurh Donetsk in 2005, Stojkovi  returned to Belgrade and impressed as Red Star won the league and cup double. He truly came into his own during 2005/06 season. 

A move to FC Nantes Atlantique, has since then followed. It has been said to be worth 3 million euros. Stojkovi 's reputation of one of the brightest goalkeeping talents in Europe is set to continue with many other major clubs keeping tabs on him.   In the January 2007, Stojkovi  was signed to Vitesse on a 6 month loan from Nantes. 


National team.
Stojkovi  was a reserve goalkeeper in the squad that reached the final of the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Germany.

He was named as a member of the Serbia and Montenegro national football team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Before the World Cup he captained Serbia and Montenegro u-21 squad during 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Portugal in the absence of the suspended Danko Lazovi . The team reached the semi-finals of the tournament.

Buddy Clark (July 26, 1911 - October 1, 1949) was a popular singer in the 1930s and 1940s.  

Clark was born Samuel Goldberg to Jewish parents in Dorchester, Massachusetts.  He made his Big Band singing debut in 1934 with Benny Goodman on the Let's Dance radio program. In 1936 he started to perform on the show, Your Hit Parade, and lasted until 1938. In the mid-1930s he signed with Vocalion Records, having a top-20 hit with "Spring Is Here". He did not have another hit until the late 1940s, but continued recording, appearing in movies, and dubbing other actors' voices.

In 1946 he signed with Columbia Records and scored his biggest hit with the song "Linda" recorded in November of that year, but hitting its peak in the following spring. Linda was written especially for the six-year-old daughter of a show business lawyer named Lee Eastman, whose client, song-writer Jack Lawrence, wrote the song at Lee s request.  Upon reaching adulthood and becoming famous as a photographer, Linda was, for awhile, something of a musician, later became a prominent spokeswoman for vegetarianism and animal rights, and broke a generation of teenage girls' hearts when she married Beatle Paul McCartney.

1947 also saw hits for Clark with such titles as "How Are Things in Glocca Mora" (from the musical Finian's Rainbow), which made the Top Ten, "Peg O' My Heart", "An Apple Blossom Wedding", and "I'll Dance at Your Wedding".  The following year he had another major hit with "Love Somebody" (a duet with Doris Day, selling a million and reaching #1 on the charts) and nine more chart hits, and extended his success into 1949 with a number of hits, both solo and duetting with Day and Dinah Shore. He was fatally injured in a private plane crash in Los Angeles, returning from a college football game, when the craft ran low on fuel and crash-landed on Beverly Boulevard.  Ironically, a month after his death, his recording of "A Dreamer's Holiday" hit the charts.

<doc id="3196662" title="List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes" nonfiltered="675" processed="667" dbindex="1480680">
This is a list of the deadliest known Atlantic hurricanes (those causing at least 1,000 deaths).

Deadliest hurricanes.
Great Hurricane of 1780.

On October 10, 1780 a powerful hurricane approached the Lesser Antilles during the American Revolution. It slowly passed through the islands, and possibly approached the Florida coastline on the 19th. The hurricane moved out to sea, after leaving 22,000 dead, making it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history. Eight British warships were sunk, and the island of Barbados was completely flattened. 

Hurricane Mitch.


Hurricane Mitch formed from a tropical wave late in October of 1998 in the central Caribbean Sea. As the storm drifted over warm water it quickly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane with 180 mph (290 km/h) winds on October 26, then stalled just off the north coast of Honduras. The hurricane slowly weakened as it inched southward toward shore and then inland before drifting westward over Central America. Extreme amounts of rainfall   accumulating to a maximum of nearly 36 inches in Choluteca, Honduras   caused flooding and landslides which killed 11,000 18,000 people and caused catastrophic damage throughout Honduras and neighboring countries.

Galveston Hurricane of 1900.


A tropical storm formed in late August of 1900 in the central tropical Atlantic and moved across Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane rapidly intensified while crossing the Gulf, and made a direct strike on the booming city of Galveston, Texas on September 8 with 135 mph (215 km/h) winds. Storm surge washed over the entire island, flattening nearly all buildings in the city and killing 6,000 12,000.

Hurricane Fifi.


Fifi formed in the Caribbean Sea in mid-September of 1974 and moved westward, steadily strengthening to peak at 110 mph (175 km/h) winds. The hurricane paralleled the coast of Honduras, staying just offshore, before making landfall in southern Belize on September 19. Fifi dropped torrential rainfall across Central America, causing catastrophic damage and 8,000 10,000 deaths.

1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane.


A tropical system formed in late August of 1930 in the open Atlantic.  It crossed the Lesser Antilles and strengthened as it moved toward Hispaniola. The hurricane made landfall in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on September 3 as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm leveled the city, and caused between 2,000 and 8,000 fatalities.

Hurricane Flora.


Hurricane Flora formed in late September of 1963 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved westward, and strengthened to a major hurricane upon moving through the Windward Islands. Flora continued intensifying and became a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale just before making landfall on southwestern Haiti on October 4. It drifted westward through Cuba, turned back to the east, and accelerated to the northeast. Flora dropped torrential rainfall along its path, and was responsible for 7,186 8,000 fatalities and billions of dollars in damage, mostly in Haiti and Cuba.

Storms table.




Notes.
Hurricane Stan is not on this list because, according to the NHC, it was only directly responsible for 80-100 deaths. The majority of the deaths (2,000+) were caused by non-tropical rains in Stan's vicinity.
Hurricane Katrina's numbers are still subject to change.

<doc id="7521989" title="Hans Grimm" nonfiltered="676" processed="668" dbindex="1480681">

Hans Grimm (born March 22, 1875 in Wiesbaden; died September 29, 1959 in Lippoldsberg) was a German writer.  

His father, Julius Grimm, was a Professor of Law who retired early and devoted his time to private historical and literary studies and to political activity as a founder member of the National Liberal party, which he represented in the Prussian parliament, and was a founder member of the German Colonial Society.

His mother, Marie Grimm, née Schlumberger Edle von Goldeck, was a minor aristocrat.

As a child, Hans Grimm showed an interest and aptitude for writing and in 1894 started to study Literature and French at the University of Lausanne.

Under pressure from his father he left university in  1895 and went into business, working for a German company in Great Britain (in Nottingham and London), and then in the British-ruled Cape Colony (in Port Elizabeth and East London), where he also rented a small farm.  

 Works .
Although Grimm s South African sojourn lasted only fourteen years, from 1897 to 1911, it had a profound effect on him: with few minor exceptions all his literary work - several collections of short stories and novels - is set in Southern Africa. His most famous novel is Volk ohne Raum (1926). The programmatic title "A people without space" indicates Grimm's belief that Germany's problems, exacerbated by defeat in the First World War, were caused by its lack of space at home or in overseas colonies: individuals, and therefore the nation, were unable to develop to their fullest potential. The novel established him as one of Germany s leading writers and demonstrated clearly his political sympathies with the political Right in Weimar Germany, and the title became a popular slogan of the National Socialist movement. The commercial success of this work   sales of the single volume edition amounted to 500,000 by 1943 - clearly shows the extent to which it struck a chord with German readers in the 1920s and 1930s.

From a strictly literary point of view - and leaving their ideological bias to one side - the most readable of Grimm's works are, however, his Novellen and short stories, in which the discipline imposed by restricted space forces him to abandon the discursive wordiness of Volk ohne Raum (1344 pages in the one-volume edition).

Nazism.
Grimm was a supporter of the Nazis, believing that only they could restore German national dignity and economic and political stability, but his relationship with the Party - of which he never formally became a member - became increasingly strained, as he fell out of sympathy with the illegality of its methods.

In a centenary address (Der verkannte Hans Grimm, Lippoldsberg 1975), designed to restore Grimm s reputation,  Klaus von Delft was able to cite letters of complaint from Grimm to the Nazi authorities on a number of subjects: the infringement of the right of confidentiality at the ballot box; the behaviour of the Hitler-Jugend and the Nazi student association; the coupling of foreign and domestic policy issues in the 1936 referendum on Hitler s rule; and criticism of Hitler s presentation of the murders of the "Night of the Long Knives" in 1934 as due judicial process. It is, however, indicative of Grimm's stance that von Delft is not able to find or cite any criticism of National Socialist racial policy. In 1938 Grimm was threatened with imprisonment by Progandaminister Joseph Goebbels and withdrew from public life.

Despite everything, however, even after 1945 Grimm remained true to his political convictions. In a pamphlet Die Erzbischofsschrift. Antwort eines Deutschen, (1950), a response to a message from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the German people, Grimm described Germany's war of aggression as an attempt to defend "European Culture" against Communism and blames Great Britain for escalating a local conflict into a global war. In 1954, having failed to gain a seat in the West German parliament for the extreme right-wing "Deutsche Reichspartei", he published a detailed defence of National Socialism under the title Warum, woher aber wohin?  (Why, whence, but whither?).

Later irrelevance.
In the context of post-war Germany Grimm was, however, a literary and political irrelevance, and died in 1959 in Lippoldsberg in the restored monastic buildings which he had purchased after the First World War, and where from 1934 to 1939 and then from 1949 onwards he had run the "Lippoldsberger Dichtertage" (Lippoldsberg Writers' Congresses) for nationalist and conservative authors.

Rush Medical College (often referred to simply as "Rush") is the medical school of Rush University, a private university in Chicago, Illinois. Rush Medical College was chartered in 1837, twelve days before the city of Chicago was chartered, and opened with 22 students on December 4, 1843. It was named after Benjamin Rush, known as the 'Father of American Psychiatry' . 

During its first century of operation, more than 10,000 physicians received their training at Rush Medical College; a "Rush Doctor" was a highly-prized commodity in the American West of the 19th century.  Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942.  With the onset of World War II, the medical college temporarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence. Its faculty continued undergraduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois. The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969 when it became part of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. In 1971, Rush Medical College reopened with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students.

Since 1972, Rush Medical College has been part of Rush University.

The RIAI Travelling Scholarship is an award made annually by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland to one or more students of architecture attending a school of architecture in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland.

The award has been made annually since 1955 and has former the basis for the careers of many notable Irish architects, among them Arthur Gibney, Sam Stephenson and Trevor Leaker.

Over the course of its history, the scholarship has been competed for in numerous ways. Current practice is for the RIAI to set a competition brief, which is then the subject of the design of a building or landscape by the competitors. An appointed jury of distinguished and learned architects and pedagogues then selects the winning entry.

In her 1986 book Needlepoint Scrapbook, she declares that "We are Ms. Pac-Man fanatics in our house." She owns a Ms. Pac-Man machine.  The book also includes a Ms. Pac-Man needlepoint design.

 Impact in popular culture .
Loretta Swit has the honor of being the inspiration of Miss Piggy. 

On the 1995 American TV series, NewsRadio, station owner and lead character Jimmy James compiled a list of "wife candidates".  With a great deal of reluctance he was forced to cross off Loretta Swit as one of his candidates. Her name was mentioned on several episodes in this context.

This Is a Stick Up... Don't Make It a Murder is the first full-length album from Hit the Lights, released on April 11 2006 on Triple Crown Records. Three of the tracks that were featured on their previous EP Until We Get Caught were redone for this album. There are guest appereances from Just Surrender, Kick Over The Traces and Race The Sun.

The album's opening track "The Call Out (You Are the Dishes)" responds to a review from Absolutepunk.net about the band's EP Until We Get Caught. The first few lyrics ("Tell me again how we're easily forgettable/So formulaic and way too simple to be/At all original, yeah, so we've heard/It's time to keep your mouth shut/While we show you how to rock and roll") reference and quote the reviewer, who wrote the band off as "enjoyable, but easily forgettable". For This Is a Stick Up... Don't Make It a Murder however, Absolutepunk.net did a large promotion campaign, including banner ads, front page news coverage and an official "album leak", previewing the entire album weeks before its release date.

Cheadle Hulme is a suburban area located in the south of Greater Manchester in the North-West of England. Historically a part of Cheshire, it now forms part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. 

The village.
While it is contiguous with the larger towns of Cheadle (to the north) and Bramhall (to the east), Cheadle Hulme retains a distinct identity, with its own shopping centre and railway station with the railway running over the brick built Seven Arches Viaduct.

The village lies on the Lady Brook (Micker Brook), one of the tributaries of the River Mersey, flowing from the Poynton area, through Bramhall, Cheadle Hulme and joining the Mersey in Stockport. 
Cheadle Hulme railway station was the cut-off point for the different stages of the 2004 upgrade of the West Coast railway.
The Old English place name Cheadle refers to ced "wood" as does leah "clearing in a wood" and may have been used since the 7th century. Viking influence in the 9th century may have introduced Danish field names such as hulm meaning "island in the fen" or "water meadow" which were used later in the modern name. 

Cheadle Hulme is the home of the historic East Cheshire Chess Club, and Cheadle Hulme School, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2005.

In 2007, Cheadle Hulme is to be the home of Waitrose's first purpose built retail outlet in the North of England.

History.

Stone axes found about 3 miles north of Cheadle Hulme around the Mersey valley and tributaries show clear evidence of population in the New Stone Age period. There is some suggestion of a Roman road from Cheadle (or possibly Manchester) to Buxton, running along the modern Cheadle Road (originally Street Lane) through modern Cheadle Hulme. Roman artefacts (coins, bracelets) discovered at Millington Hall, and Hulme Hall support this.

In 1321 Sir Robert (Roger) de Chedle, lord of Cheadle manor, died leaving no male heirs. The elder daughter, Clemence (married to William de Bagylegh) inherited the southern half (technically overlord to her sister's share), "Cheadle Holme". In the mid 17th century the estate was acquired by the Moseley family and became known as Cheadle Moseley, and later Cheadle Hulme.

Cheadle Hulme was originally several hamlets, which still feature in names of areas today. These included Smithy Green, Lane End, Gill Bent, Grove Lane and Hulme Hall. The many farms which covered the area also retain their names today, as in Orish Mere Farm, Hill Top Farm and Hursthead Farm.

Education.

Cheadle Hulme is home to seventeen schools and one college, listed below.

<doc id="7725894" title="Tony Leswick" nonfiltered="687" processed="679" dbindex="1480692">
Tony Leswick (Born March 17, 1923, in Humbolt, Saskatchewan, Canada -
Died July 1, 2001, in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada) was a former ice hockey forward who played mostly for the New York Rangers and Detroit Red Wings of the NHL. Nicknamed "Tough Tony" and "Mighty Mouse," he was known also as a little pest. Little, because he stood just 5'7" tall and weighed 160lbs. He is most famous for scoring the final goal in overtime of game seven of the 1954 Stanley Cup final.

Playing career.
Minor league hockey.
Leswick played his junior hockey in Saskatoon with the Dodgers and Quakers, and quickly started turning heads. In 1942, Leswick finally jumping into the AHL with the Cleveland Barons and scored 40 points in only 52 games. He moved onto the PCHL in the following season to play for the New Westminster Royals. Scoring 36 points in 19 games there, he followed up his great season by joining with the Winnipeg Navy for the next. After just 12 games in Winnipeg, the New York Rangers (who acquired him in June of 1945) had seen enough and brought him into their lineup for the remainder of the 1945-46 season. 

Professional career.
Leswick delivered. He scored 15 goals in his shortened rookie season for the Rangers and quickly established himself as one of the few bright spots in New York. He loved getting under peoples skin, including that of Montreal Canadiens' Rocket Richard, and Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings. Leswick recorded consecutive 20-goal seasons in 1947 and 1948, but the Rangers continued to miss the playoffs or get knocked out in the early rounds. After scoring 44 points in 1949-50, he was named to the NHL second all-star team. During this time, he formed a successful combination with Edgar Laprade and Dunc Fisher. 

Detroit had seen the way that Leswick would go after Howe and knew that took guts. They decided to trade for Leswick after the 1950-51 season. On June 8, Tony Leswick became a Detroit Red Wing after a blockbuster trade that saw Gaye Stewart going to New York. Leswick would continue his pestering ways and was inserted on a line with Marty Pavelich and Glen Skov. He would help lead Detroit to Stanley Cups in 1952, 1954, and 1955. He is probably most remembered for his winning goal in game seven of the 1954 Stanley Cup finals against the Montreal Canadiens. Leswick had this to say in an interview with Chuck O'Donnell :

 "It was early in overtime, I don't know, maybe four or five minutes in. We were trying to change our forwards. I had the puck around center ice or so and I just wanted to do the smart thing and throw it in. If I get caught with the puck and the Canadiens steal it, we may get caught and they may get an odd-man break. Just like that, the game could be over.

So, I'm just thinking of lifting the puck down deep in their end, just making the safe play. So I flipped it in nice and high and turned to get off the ice. The next thing I know, everyone's celebrating. It had gone in. I said, "You've got to be kidding. It went in? Get out of here!"" 

Defenceman Doug Harvey went back to glove the puck, but instead deflected it past goaltender Gerry McNeil and into the net for the game-winning goal.

Following his third Stanley Cup victory in 1955, Leswick was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks along with Glen Skov, Johnny Wilson and Benny Woit for Jerry Toppazzini, John McCormack, Dave Creighton and Gord Hollingworth, on May 27. He would score 11 goals and 11 assists in the 1955-56 season for Chicago before jumping to the rival WHL. The Edmonton Flyers welcomed his 53 points in the 1956-57 season and he was invited to another All-Star team. After a brief 22 games for Detroit in 1957, Leswick would again join the Edmonton Flyers until the close of the 1959 season. He would play 9 games the following season for the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL before retiring from playing hockey.

Leswick the coach.
Leswick tried his hand at coaching starting in 1958. He replaced the current coach of the Edmonton Flyers midseason in 1957-58 and would continue until midseason of 1958-59. He felt he was more of a help to the team on the ice. He would try his hand at coaching one more time with the Indianapolis Capitols/Cincinnati Wings of the CPHL in the 1963-64 season. They would finish last in the league with a 12-53-7 record and Leswick would retire from the world of hockey.

<doc id="643343" title="Password (TV series)" nonfiltered="688" processed="680" dbindex="1480693">

Password was a long-running American television game show produced by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions. The show was initially hosted by Allen Ludden and was created by Bob Stewart for Goodson-Todman Productions.

Password originally aired for 1,555 telecasts from October 2, 1961 to September 15, 1967 on CBS and for 1099 additional shows from April 5, 1971 to June 27, 1975 on ABC Daytime. The show's regular announcers were Jack Clark and (later) Lee Vines on CBS, and John Harlan on ABC. 

How to Play.

Two teams   each consisting of one celebrity player and one civilian contestant   competed. The password (the word to be conveyed) was given to one player on each team and was shown to the audience and to home viewers. Game play alternated between the two teams. On either team, the player who was given the password gave a one-word clue from which his/her partner attempted to guess the password. If the partner failed to guess the password in the allotted five-second time limit, or if an illegal clue was given (two or more words, a hyphenated word, or any part or form of the password), play passed to the opposing team. 

The game continued until one of the teams guessed the password correctly or until ten clues had been given. Scoring was based on the number of clues given when the password was guessed, i.e. 10 points were awarded for guessing the password on the first clue, nine points on the second clue, eight points on the third clue, etc., down to one point on the tenth and final clue. On the ABC revival, the rules imposed a limit of six clues, with the last clue worth five points, in order to expedite the gameplay. In addition, teams were given the option of either playing or passing control of the first clue to the opposing team. Specifically, the team that was trailing in score, or who had lost the previous game was offered the option; when the score was tied, the team that failed to get the password was awarded the option.

The first team to reach 25 points won the game and a chance to win an additional $250 by playing the "Lightning Round", in which the civilian contestant on the prevailing team tried to guess five passwords within 60 seconds from clues given by his/her celebrity partner. $50 was awarded for each correctly-guessed password (increased to $100 from 1973 to 1974). 

The Lightning Round was among the first bonus rounds on a television game (along with the phrase game on the original Beat the Clock). On the ABC version from 1971 1974, immediately after completing the Lightning Round, the player wagered any amount of his/her winnings on  his/her celebrity partner's ability to guess a "Betting Word" within 15 seconds. 

On each episode from 1961-1975, Ludden would caution the players about unacceptable clues by stating, "If you hear this sound (a buzzer would sound) it means your clue has not been accepted by our authority, (name of "word authority")." Word authorities on the CBS version included New York University professor David H. Greene and World Book Dictionary editor Dr. Reason A. Goodwin. Robert Stockwell and Carolyn Duncan served as word authorities during the ABC version.

Contestants.

On the CBS daytime version, contestants played two matches, win or lose, with each game awarding $100 to the winner. During the first few weeks of the CBS nighttime version, the same two players stayed for the entire show, playing as many matches as time allowed. This practice was eventually changed to at least three pairs of contestants each playing one match with each losing contestant earning $50. Each nighttime game awarded its winner $250. In 1965, the show adopted an annual "Tournament of Champions" where contestants on the daytime version who won both their games were invited back to compete for more money.

On the ABC version, winning contestants could stay until either defeated or victory in a maximum of 10 games, thus retiring them as undefeated champions (ABC removed this limit later in the show's run). From 1973-1974, the first contestant to win a two-out-of-three match played the Lightning Round.

From November 18, 1974 to February 21, 1975, Password became Password All-Stars, where teams of celebrities played for charity in a tournament-style format. The tournament ended with the Grandmaster's Championship, which involved Richard Dawson, Bill Bixby, Hal Linden and Betty White. Dawson won the tournament and was awarded $25,000 for his favorite charity.

After the celebrity format modification proved unpopular with fans, Goodson-Todman made Password All-Stars simply Password again, but the show carried over elements of All-Stars, mainly in order to use the set that had been redesigned for the all-celebrity period. Among these were an elimination round in which four contestants (three new players and the winner from the previous game) competed with the help of the two celebrities in the first round. In the qualifying round, one of the two celebrities used a one-word clue to a password (with both celebrities alternating turns on giving clues), and the four contestants would ring in with the password. A correct response earned that contestant one point, with three points needed to qualify for the regular game. An incorrect response locks that player out of the word in play. The first two contestants to reach three points went on to play the regular Password game.

In the regular game, an addition to the rules was the "double" option, which the first clue giver could ask to increase the word value to 20 points by giving only one clue; if that word was missed, the other team could score the 20 points with a second clue. The first team to reach 50 points or more could win thousands of dollars in the Big Money Lightning Round, using a three-step structure in which the winning team attempted to guess three passwords within 30 seconds per structure. The contestant was paid as follows:

 Part one: Each password paid $25. Guessing all three passwords in 30 seconds further netted $5 for each second left on the clock. Obviously, the round ended if the received proved unable to guess any of the three passwords, and the contestant returned to the elimination panel to compete for the right to play the main game again.
 Part two: The money earned in part one would be multiplied by the number of passwords guessed in part two. Naming all three passwords this time added $10 for each second left. If the receiver failed to identify any of the passwords in part two, the round ended and the contestant still kept all part-one winnings.
 Part three: Naming all three passwords in 30 seconds multiplied the contestant's part-two winnings tenfold (meaning if a player accumulated $500 after two parts, guessing all three passwords in this part would earn him/her $5000 in cash).

Password won the first-ever Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show in 1974.

The ABC Password was the first of the Goodson shows to be taped regularly on the West Coast. The original CBS version made annual trips to CBS Television City during the 1960s, including once when the CBS New York studios were fitted for color TV. Otherwise, it was most often taped in New York at CBS-TV Studio 52 (now Studio 54) and CBS-TV Studio 50 (the Ed Sullivan Theater). Password moved permanently to Hollywood, California at ABC Studio TV-10 "The Vine Street Theater" (on Vine Street in Hollywood) and the ABC Television Center on Prospect Avenue when ABC brought it back in 1971.

Scheduling History.

CBS, 1961-67.
Upon its premiere in 1961, Password had not only the prestige and reputation of Goodson-Todman and former GE College Bowl host Ludden, but also enjoyed fairly weak competition from ABC and NBC at its timeslot, 2 p.m. Eastern/1 Central, where it stayed for the entirety of its CBS run. For the first few years, the show was so successful that the other two networks ran mostly short-lived talk/variety shows and soap operas against it. Further, the program that followed it was another daytime television institution, Art Linkletter%27s House Party. These two shows, along with CBS' dominating soap line-up, made the network nearly an impregnable choice for daytime viewers.

However, CBS News' preemption of the show one day in July 1966 in order to cover a Pentagon press conference infuriated some viewers, many of whom changed channels to discover two relatively new shows: a meldromatic, emotionally-charged soap on NBC titled Days of Our Lives and a titillating, sometimes suggestive game on ABC from Chuck Barris titled The Newlywed Game. Both new shows especially attracted large numbers of young housewives, the favorite demographic group for daytime advertisers such as cleaning products, toys, and the like. This left Password with an increasingly older audience, and the predisposition of then-CBS daytime head Fred Silverman against the genre did not help things. Despite pleas by Mark Goodson to have the show's timeslot changed to 4 p.m., (where it would have faced his own Match Game on NBC and the eventual cult soap favorite Dark Shadows on ABC), Silverman decided to pull the plug at the end of the 1966-67 season. Succeeding Password at 2/1 was an in-house network soap, Love is a Many Splendored Thing, which ran until 1973.

Password did not entirely leave the public consciousness, however, as some color episodes (after circa 1965) went into syndicated reruns, a practice better known among cancelled situation comedies. Numerous local stations ran these until about 1970 or so, typically to fill a gap in their morning or late-afternoon schedules. Their success prompted Goodson-Todman to revive What's My Line in first-run five-day-per-week syndication, which, in turn, brought about several revivals of older formats during the 1970s.

ABC, 1971-75.
The economic recession that greeted the turn of the new decade left the networks' daytime divisions saddled with a large number of costly serials, which had reached an all-time high number in 1970. With such saturation, ABC looked to unload one or more of their soaps, and they chose none other than Dark Shadows to begin the housecleaning, in spite of its devoted fan base. The problem was that the fans were overwhelmingly teenagers, who were not considered suitable targets for advertising at that time of day. ABC programmers took note of Password's surprising success in syndication and approached Goodson about reviving the show. Goodson, locked out of CBS due to continued unresponsiveness and crowded out of NBC due to strong games there, jumped at the offer and set up shop for the first time in southern California. The April 1971 premiere of Password at 4 p.m. Eastern/3 Central marked the first G-T game on the networks since NBC cancelled Match Game some eighteen months earlier. Despite actual threats by some enraged Dark Shadows follwers to disrupt production of Password, the show went forward and instantly beat the NBC soap Somerset and reruns of Gomer Pyle, USMC on CBS. 

Impressed by the ratings numbers, ABC believed the show would help bolster a sagging midday lineup. Thus, in September, Password moved to 12:30/11:30, swapping places with edited half-hour reruns of Love American Style. There, it held its own against CBS' venerable soap Search for Tomorrow and NBC's The Who, What or Where Game. 

But, in March 1972, the network bought a fast-paced quiz from Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall titled Split Second, and shoved Password up a half-hour, where it remained until its cancellation. Unfortunately, this may not have been a good move, as NBC's Jeopardy had long dominated the 12 Noon/11 timeslot. Further, when CBS replaced its controversial soap Where the Heart Is with a new entry, The Young and the Restless, in March 1973, things got even worse, as the soap became an unexpectedly immediate hit. Even though NBC moved Jeopardy in favor of, ironically enough, the Bob Stewart-packaged Jackpot in January 1974, Password did not benefit, and ABC and G-T decided to perform radical surgery on the show with the "All-Stars" format.

This proved to be the show's undoing on ABC, due to viewers' aversion to games with no civilian contestants participating and the multi-layered game structure, which many believed bogged down the show's formerly brisk pace. By spring 1975, G-T abandoned this mistake and made a last-ditch attempt to salvage the show with a blending of both "All-Stars" and the original game structure. But the effort was futile, as viewers kept defecting, and ABC cancelled Password along with all but two of its daytime games by Independence Day. Ludden, wife Betty White, Goodson, and the production staff gave a gracious farewell on the finale. Another Goodson-Todman game, Showoffs, took its place on the schedule.

Revivals.

Main article: Password Plus and Super Password;

Password Plus.
NBC brought Password back as Password Plus on January 8, 1979 with Allen Ludden returning as host. It was originally announced in Variety magazine as Password '79, in the manner that Match Game named its 1973 version with the year, but the name was changed when, during a run-through, Carol Burnett commented "this is more than Password, it's Password Plus."  

Super Password.
On September 24, 1984 NBC brought the format back as Super Password with Bert Convy hosting and Gene Wood announcing.  Rich Jeffries was the announcer for the first ten weeks and filled in for Wood sporadically thereafter. Bob Hilton also filled in for one week in 1985 or 1986.
 
Super Password ran until March 24 1989 and was cancelled on the same day as another NBC game show, Sale of the Century.

Celebrities.
Among the more famous Password celebrity players over the years include Lucille Ball, Elizabeth Montgomery, Joan Crawford, Bill Bixby, Richard Dawson, Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, Betty White and Nipsey Russell. Burnett played every Password version except for Super Password and was one of the first celebrity players on the nighttime premiere in 1962; the other was her mentor, Garry Moore on whose primetime-TV show she was also a regular. Also appearing at one time or another, were Arthur Godfrey, Jim Backus, Dick Van Dyke, the comedy team of Marty Allen  and Steve Rossi, Betsy Palmer, Sammy Davis, Jr., Jerry Lewis, and on one memorable nighttime episode, Mr. & Mrs. James Stewart delighted viewers with their gameplay. Many stars of the New York theater scene also made appearances (usually on the daytime version), and included Darren McGavin, Carol Channing, Barry Nelson, and Dorothy Loudon. 

Game show hosts Monty Hall, Tom Kennedy (who would eventually host Password Plus), Bill Cullen (who would sub for Allen Ludden on Password Plus) and Bert Convy (later the host of Super Password) were also invited to play as celebrities. Tom Kennedy's brother, Jack Narz, Gene Rayburn, Wink Martindale and Jim Perry were also Password Plus panelists. Pat Sajak played on both Password Plus and Super Password, although he was still a weatherman until late 1981 when he began hosting Wheel of Fortune. The NBC crew played a prank on Sajak during the Super version; instead of the usual word-display sound effect during one main game, the viewers heard the four-note signal that is used to introduced Wheel of Fortune main-game puzzles.

Password fixtures White, Cullen, Lawrence, Markie Post (a former Goodson-Todman staffer) Shelly Smith and Russell were also frequent panelists on Pyramid. Peter Lawford also did both shows, although he was considered much better at Password. Lawford set a long-standing record for playing the Lightning Round in the shortest time   12 seconds on the CBS version. It would take nearly a decade and a switch to ABC before Elizabeth Montgomery finally broke the record with a 10-second Lightning Round.

Episode status.

Many, but not all, of the CBS primetime episodes were preserved on videotape. The final year of the CBS daytime version was preserved on color videotape, as the producers chose to syndicate those reruns following the program's first cancellation. Most of the earlier daytime episodes are presumed lost; at least two daytime episodes are available on home video, each one as part of a general game show compliation package.

The ABC version is considered to be almost completely gone. Clips from an ABC episode featuring Brett Somers and Jack Klugman was featured on VH1's I Love the '70s: Volume 2 in 2006. GSN aired the complete Somers/Klugman episode on the morning of September 11, 2006, in the early morning hours as part of its weekly overnight classic game show programming. A second studio master, from 1972 and featuring Sheila MacRae and Martin Milner, is also known to have survived. Three more episodes survive on the videotape trading circuit, as recorded by home viewers: the Password All-Stars finale; a 1975 episode with Betty White and Vicki Lawrence; and the 1975 finale with Kate Jackson and Sam Melville. A few more episodes from the ABC version also exist at UCLA's film and television archive. It is believed that the videotapes that were used for the ABC version of Password were recycled and reused for the Dawson version of Family Feud a few years later. 

Both NBC revivals of Password exist in their entirety.

Theme Songs.
The theme song used on Password from 1961 to 1963 is called "Holiday Jaunt" by Kurt Rehfeld. That was followed the same year by a catchy swing theme composed by Bob Cobert, from 1963 to 1967, which was used until the CBS version's cancellation. (Viewers would often see emcee Ludden snapping his fingers to the Cobert swing tune as the closing credits flashed.) When Password returned on ABC in 1971, Score Productions provided a theme with a synth-heavy arrangement, similar to the cues heard on The Price Is Right. The theme used later in that version's run (beginning with Password All-Stars in 1974) was titled "Bicentennial Funk", and was used until the finale in 1975. A vamp version of "Bicentennial Funk" was once considered for use as a "think cue" on the game show Match Game, but it never made it. That theme, as well as the themes for Password Plus and Super Password, were also composed by Score Productions.

Versions outside the USA.
In New Zealand, a M ori language version called Kupuhuna is aired 3 nights a week on M ori Television.
In the United Kingdom, versions of Password were produced by the BBC in the 1970s, and by Thames Television for Channel 4 which was hosted by Tom O'Connor and Ulster Television for ITV in the 1980s which was hosted by Gordon Burns.

Home versions.



The Milton Bradley Company introduced the first home version of Password in 1962 and subsequently released 24 editions of the game until 1986. (Owing to common superstition, these releases were numbered 1-12 and 14-25, skipping 13.) It was tied with Concentration as the most prolific of Milton Bradley's home versions of popular game shows, and was produced well into the Super Password era of the television show. Milton Bradley also published three editions of a Password Plus home game between 1979 and 1981. More recently, Endless Games has released four versions of Password since 1997. 

A computer version of Super Password was released by GameTek for MS-DOS systems, as well as the Apple II and Commodore 64, shortly before the show was canceled; a Nintendo Entertainment System version was also planned but never released.  Tiger Electronics also released an electronic handheld "Super Password" game in the late 90's--oddly, many years after the show had been cancelled.

Trivia.
 The practice of the announcer whispering the Password to the home audience--as well as displaying it on screen--was devised by creator Bob Stewart for the benefit of his mother, who could speak but not read English.
During the last few weeks before its cancellation in 1969, the set of the Goodson-Todman game Snap Judgement on NBC changed to resemble the look of the CBS Password.
 Because neither original announcer Jack Clark nor Goodson-Todman chief announcer Johnny Olson had yet moved to California from New York (as they would do shortly after the 1971 Password premiere), another voiceover artist, John Harlan, best known at that point for his work on You Don't Say, won the job for the ABC version. Harlan is probably better known to the general public for the NBC Bob Hope specials and the several incarnations of Name That Tune between 1974 and 1985.
 Until the introduction of "All-Stars," the ABC version used the same mechanical clock for the main portion of the Lightning Round as on CBS, but switched to a digital (eggcrate) display for the "Betting Word." When "All-Stars" began, all numerical displays were converted to digital.
 In Super Password, Convy affectionately called the prop used in the Ca$hword rounds the 'Magic Toaster'. The original 'Magic Toaster' was accidentally destroyed by Convy on one infamous episode, causing the producers to create a new one, which Betty White destroyed in the final episode.
 The correct answer/win bell heard on Super Password was a G-natural bell NBC used on many of its game shows, including Blockbusters (Bill Cullen and Bill Rafferty versions), Card Sharks (with Jim Perry), Classic Concentration (early episodes), and even gameshow parodies featured on Saturday Night Live; the bell heard on Password Plus rang in the key of C-natural.
 The sound effect heard when a player gave an illegal clue on Password Plus was reused on Super Password and Body Language.
 The wrong answer/time expire buzzer used most often on Password Plus was also heard on Jim Perry's Sale of the Century.
 On an episode of Super Password, Patty Duke inadvertently said the password, Testimony, which made Rip Taylor throw a stool and take off his toupee.

<doc id="1390396" title="Front (Soviet Army)" nonfiltered="690" processed="682" dbindex="1480695">
A Front (     ) was a major military organization in the Soviet Army, roughly equivalent to an army or army group in British or American military terminology.  This is not to be confused with the more general usage of military front, describing a geographic area in wartime.  

An interesting and important distinction between the two is that a Soviet front typically has its own organic tactical fixed-wing air force of Army level. This Air Army is directly subordinated to the Frontal commander (typically a ground commander). The entire front might report either to STAVKA or a TVD, or teatr voennykh deistvii - Theatre of Military Operations.

Soviet fronts were raised during the Polish-Soviet War, Invasion of Poland (Byelorussian and Ukrainian) and the Second World War.

During the Cold War, fronts and their staffs were integrated with various military districts, or became "Group of Soviet Forces" in a Warsaw Pact nation. It should be noted that not all Military Districts rated a Front. Thus some Military Districts do not have an organic Air Army.

The University of Limpopo is a university in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. It was formed on 1 January, 2005, by the merger of the University of the North and the Medical University of South Africa (MEDUNSA). These previous institutions form the Turfloop and MEDUNSA campuses of the university, respectively.

History.
The University of the North was established in 1959 under the apartheid regime's policy of separate ethnically-based institutions of higher learning policy. The university was sited at Turfloop farm about 40 km east of Pietersburg. The town that grew around the university was named Sovenga, (SOtho, VENda, GAzankulu) for the three ethnic groups that were supposed to study there. In reality, most inhabitants refer to the town as Mankweng, after one of the chiefs of the area. Under later apartheid, UNIN served as a "model" university where dignitaries were brought to show the "viability" of the separate facilities. As such, it received heavy government subsidies, but the real problem was that the students that the university supposedly served were so under-resourced in their standard education that the quality of instruction was placed under incredible demands. 

The university was a center of resistance to apartheid in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s with the SADF occupying the grounds often during those years. After the end of apartheid, the university struggled through various re-organization and rationalization schemes, yet always managed to survive. Enrollment fluxuated wildly in the years after liberation and while some faculty did not transition very easily, others were able to seize upon the new opportunities.

This is an alphabetical list of people who have or had the infectious disease hepatitis C. This disease, four times more infectious than HIV, has infected roughly 3% of the world's population. More than 170 million are chronic carriers (most of whom are symptomless and unaware of their infection) and are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. It is the leading cause of liver transplant in the United States. Organisations such as the American Liver Foundation encourage celebrities to speak openly about their infection to raise awareness and encourage those who at risk to get tested.

<doc id="1242955" title="Strange Days at Blake Holsey High" nonfiltered="696" processed="688" dbindex="1480701">


Strange Days at Blake Holsey High, also known as Black Hole High, is a Canadian science fiction television program which first aired in North America in October 2002 on NBC. It is set at the fictional boarding school of the title, where a Science Club (five students and their teacher) investigates mysterious phenomena, most of which is centered around a wormhole located on the school grounds. Spanning four seasons, the series developed into a success, and has been sold to networks around the globe.

Created by Jim Rapsas, the series intertwines elements of mystery, drama, romance, and comedy. The writing of the show is structured around various scientific principles, with emotional and academic struggles combined with unfolding mysteries of a preternatural nature. In addition to its consistent popularity among children, it has been recognised by adults as strong family entertainment. Forty-two episodes of the series, each roughly twenty-five minutes in length, have been produced, the last three of which premiered in January 2006. Those three final episodes that aired were combined into a film, Strange Days: Conclusions.

Premise.
The show revolves around a group of five friends and their favorite teacher.  Together they form the Science Club at Blake Holsey High, a boarding school located in southern Ontario. Strange things occur at Blake Holsey High, and the Science Club decides to discover what is going on. They consider what a wormhole, a floating Qi Gong ball, and Pearadyne Industries - a lab that was destroyed years ago right next to the school - all have to do with the mystery.

Main cast and characters.



 Emma Taylor-Isherwood as Josie Trent. Josie is the show's main protagonist, and her voice is heard over the opening credits. She transfers to Blake Holsey High at the beginning of the series, and is the one who discovered the wormhole first. She's curious and headstrong, and is the one who most wants to know what is going on. In Corrine's words, she has "the hots for Vaughn," but the relationship is a rocky one due to trust issues. Josie is an extremely smart girl.

 Shadia Simmons as Corrine Baxter. Josie's best friend and roommate, Corrine is the so-called "brains" (with a self-claimed IQ of 172) in the Science Club. Comparable to Hermione Granger in Harry Potter, she's the one with the school-smarts but often has problems with street-smarts. Corrine is as compulsively neat and well-behaved as Josie is messy and rebellious. Has "a thing" for Marshall.
 
 Michael Seater as Lucas Randall. Lucas is a conspiracy theorist, convinced that aliens do exist. He comes up with unorthodox theories that often end up saving the day. He has a romantic interest in Josie, largely unrequited; and an interest in Josie's clone as of "Conclusions".


 Noah Reid as Marshall Wheeler. Lucas and Marshall are best friends and roommates. Marshall is more social and funloving than Lucas, and helps to keep him down to earth in this way. Marshall performs in a band (Magnet 360) with other Blake Holsey students.

 Robert Clark as Vaughn Pearson. Vaughn is the fifth student in the science club. His father is Victor Pearson, the owner and founder of Pearadyne Industries. Vaughn lives at home with his father for a time, as their house is practically next door to the school. When he does live at Blake Holsey High, he lives alone.  Has a thing for Josie--they are an on again/off again couple.

 Jeff Douglas as Professor Noel Zachary. Zachary, or "Z", is the presiding teacher of the Science Club. Like Josie, he is very curious to find out what is going on at Blake Holsey High. He was able to go to school to become a teacher thanks to a scholarship from Pearadyne Industries, and is the only adult that the Science Club fully trusts.

 Valerie Boyle as Principal Amanda Durst. The disagreeable Prinicipal Durst is a looming presence over the Science Club, and differs with Professor Zachary's easygoing ways.  A former science teacher, she is a reluctant conspirator in Victor Pearson's plans.

 Lawrence Bayne as Victor Pearson. Victor Pearson is a benefactor of the school and a constant antagonist to the Science Club's investigations. Secretive and somewhat ruthless, Victor is deeply distrusted by Josie and Lucas, which puts Victor's son Vaughn in a perpetually awkward position. Although Victor Pearson frequently serves as the villain of the show, he is eventually revealed to be "the good guy" in his long struggle to restore Pearadyne and rescue his time-lost wife. The destiny of Victor, as explained in "Conclusions," is that he was to create time travel technology in a way that will eventually benefit humanity.

 Tony Munch as The Janitor. The Janitor is an enigmatic character who seems to understand the mysteries at Blake Holsey High, but reveals little.  In "Conclusions" he is finally identified as an observer of other time travelers.  The clone Josie states that the Janitor is from so far into the future that it is almost unimaginable.

Significant objects and locations.
 Qigong Ball/Chi Ball/Floating Ball: Once a normal ball used to handle stress and concentration, but became a source of unlimited potential. Josie had used these balls for concentration during Science Club, but one was taken from her by Professor Zachary. The other one was affected  by the energy of the wormhole in a trip to the 1970's, which made it gravity-less. It defied the laws of physics, which was why Victor (Vic) Pearson stole it from her years ago when he was in Blake Holsey High. Presenting it to Sarah Lynch, they started their plan to create Pearadyne which later caused an explosion at Pearadyne Industries, form a wormhole in Blake Holsey and strange occurrences. Victor used this ball to power their the lab, but it later caused its destruction, along with Sarah's disappearance. Josie found the ball and assumed that Vaughn and Victor had plotted to use it. She stole it from them, but was later stolen back by Josie's Clone from the future. Returned to Victor, he plans to keep it in safe keeping this time.
 Wormhole: A powerful vortex that can lead to either the future or the past that can be found in the office of the Science Teacher (Zachary or Middleton). Many agents have used this to cover the knowledge of the wormhole a secret from everyone, however energy from the wormhole has released and affected the students and the school due to their emotions and conditions.
 Pearadyne Industries/Labs: A laboratory created by Victor Pearson and Sarah Lynch. It was used to create inventions and master quantum physics. Pearadyne was destroyed in an explosion that covered the disappearance of many workers, especially Sarah Lynch (Vaughn's mother).

History.
Strange Days at Blake Holsey High began airing in Canada on Global and on NBC, as well as VRAK.TV in Quebec. In the United States, meanwhile, it aired on Discovery Kids and NBC. In late March 2003, almost six months after its North American debut, the series was sold to several international markets at the annual MipTV, which was held at Cannes, France. The United Kingdom broadcasting network ITV acquired the terrestrial television right to the series, while the pay television rights were sold to Fox Kids (which became Jetix in 2005) in Europe and Latin America, who showed the series in countries including the UK, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Panama and Argentina. Fox Kids Europe has a partnership deal with the Disney Channel, which enabled the show to be broadcast in Australia, New Zealand, France and Asia. In Russia (Tomsk), the series airs on CTC. In Denmark, it airs on TV2 Denmark. It also airs in other European countries such as Norway (and other Scandinavian nations), the Netherlands, Portugal, Israel, Poland (it airs on Jetix), Turkey and Italy, as well as Colombia in South America.  


Fireworks Entertainment, the company behind Strange Days at Blake Holsey High, closed down after the production of Season 3. There were three additional episodes of the series, which aired as a finale film event on January 28 2006 on the Discovery Kids channel, as "Strange Days Conclusions". As of June 2006, no episode or season of Strange Days at Blake Holsey High has been legally released to DVD in any country. In 2004 it was announced that a DVD box set of season one was to be released in the United Kingdom on July 26, 2004, and websites such as Amazon.com put up the DVD for pre-order. The release was later pulled without explanation.

Strange Days at Blake Holsey High has been nominated for several awards, but won none. Writers Jeff King, Jeff Schechter and Thérèse Beaupré were nominated for episodes broadcast in the year 2003 at the 31st Daytime Emmy Awards in 2004, in the category Outstanding Writing in a Children's Series. Emma Taylor-Isherwood, Shadia Simmons and Robert Clark were each given Young Artist Award nominations in early 2003, although Isherwood was placed in the supporting category, Simmons was elevated to lead, and Clark was considered a "guest actor". Simmons received a second nomination the following year, alongside Talia Schlanger (Madison). The Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television nominated creative team Tony Thatcher, Adam Haight, Jeff King and Kevin May for Best Children's or Youth Fiction Program or Series at the annual Gemini Awards in late 2004, and the Directors Guild of Canada also recognised the show in areas such as sound editing, team achievement, and the product as a whole in 2003 and 2004.

In 2006 Strange Days was nominated for two Emmy Awards: "Outstanding Children's Series" and "Outstanding Writing".

Although it is not a spin-off, Strange Days at Blake Holsey High has significant connections with several other series for children. 
 Like Strange Days at Blake Holsey High, the Disney Channel series So Weird dealt with paranormal phenomena, and had series-long story arcs. Henry Winkler was an executive producer/consultant on both shows. ;
 All of the continuing adult cast and some of the guest stars on Strange Days previously appeared an another Disney Channel series, The Famous Jett Jackson. Both shows were produced in Canada by Fireworks. ;
 The Zack Files, another series about a young protagonist encountering the paranormal, starred Robert Clark and Michael Seater, with Shadia Simmons in a recurring role.
 Michael Seater (Lucas), Shadia Simmons (Corrine) and John Ralston (Avenir) have since gone on to appear in the Disney Channel series Life with Derek. Seater plays the title character. Simmons has a recurring role as Emily Davis, a friend of Derek's stepsister, Casey MacDonald.  Ralston plays George Venturi. This show is also produced in Canada.

ReBoot: My Two Bobs is a 2001 Canadian made-for-TV movie based on the series ReBoot. The movie continues the events set in motion by the cliffhanger ending in . Along with Daemon Rising, the two movies are considered the fourth season. It was originally broadcast in Canada as a film, but was later rebroadcast as 4 individual episodes. Broken down into its component episodes, it is 'My Two Bobs', 'Life's A Glitch', 'Null-Bot Of The Bride' and 'Crouching Binome, Hidden Virus'. It was released on DVD along with Daemon Rising.

 Plot .


At the end of Daemon Rising, Bob and Dot get engaged. However, a few seconds later, a portal opens from the net and Ray Tracer and another Bob step through, leading to confusion. The new Bob looks like the original from Seasons 1 and 2, leading Dot to name the Bob which merged with his keytool Glitch Bob. The movie starts the efforts of Dot, the Bobs, and the other mainframers in trying to make sense of the situation and find out who is the real Bob.

Dot decides to marry the new Bob, leading Glitch Bob to attempt to return himself to his original form. His efforts fail and leave him in a catatonic state; covered in a starry substance that proves to be impenetrable. Dot continues with her wedding plans as Glitch Bob is treated at the Supercomputer.

On the wedding day, Dot prepares to marry Bob with many mainframers in attendance while Glitch Bob's condition is steadily worsening at the Supercomputer. The other guardians are unable to get past the stary substance covering Glitch Bob to treat him, and the substance eventually dims completely, leading the Guardians to believe they have lost him. However, this prompts the keytools to separate from Glitch Bob, and they revive him before returning to the guardians. His code no longer matches what the guardians have on file, suggesting that he is in fact the copy.

Glitch Bob returns to Mainframe to stop the wedding, where it is revealed that Megabyte stole part of his code. Glitch is able to return this code to Bob, causing Megabyte to revert to his old form. Bob reveals that Megabyte is now a Trojan horse virus, able to shapeshift. Megabyte is able to escape capture by using an alias and infiltrates the war room by taking on the form of Frisket. The movie ends on a cliffhanger with Megabyte in "complete control" of the Principle Office.

Calcutta time was one of the two time zones established in British India in 1884. It was established during the International Meridian Conference held at Washington, D.C in the United States. It was then decided that India were to have two time zones, with Calcutta (now Kolkata) would use the 90th east meridian and Bombay (Mumbai) the 75th east meridian. Calcutta time was set at 5 hours, 30 minutes, and 21 seconds in advance of GMT.

47 Tucanae ( NGC 104) or just 47 Tuc is a globular cluster located in the constellation Tucana. It is about 13,400 light years away from Earth, and can be seen with the naked eye, being bright enough to have been given a Flamsteed number with a visual magnitude of 4.0.

47 Tucanae was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751, its southern location having hidden it from European observers until then. The cluster appears roughly the size of the full moon in the sky.

It is the second brightest globular cluster in the sky (after Omega Centauri), and is noted for having a very bright and dense core. It has 22 known millisecond pulsars, and at least 21 blue stragglers near the core.

47 Tucanae is included in Sir Patrick Moore's Caldwell catalogue as C106.

<doc id="1214652" title="Oobi" nonfiltered="705" processed="697" dbindex="1480710">
For the computer-related acronym, see OOBI.;
Oobi (pronounced OO-bee) is an American children's television series. Based on an award-winning short-form series, the show is directed toward preschoolers. It is currently broadcast on Noggin.

Style.
Oobi uses bare-handed puppetry, in which the hands themselves are puppets, costumed with the characters' eyes, clothing and hair, and some token props. The thumbs are used to represent mouth movement, and the fingers flutter, clench, and make other movements to indicate emotions. The hands also serve usual purposes, such as holding objects and turning doorknobs.  A majority of the characters are right-handed, but two (Mrs. Johnson and Paula) are left-handed.

The characters' speech is similar to that of characters in shows such as Teletubbies and Fimbles. Their vocabulary is simple, and they speak in simple sentences. For example, "Uma school first day" is said in place of "It's Uma's first day of school" or "It's my first day of school." This is considered speech vandalism to some people.

Concept.
Oobi focuses on the everyday adventures of the "title" character, his younger sister Uma, his best friend Kako, and his grandfather, Grampu. It mirrors the life of its young audience, in which everything is new. Although the characters DO NOT conjugate verbs the show is intended to build skills such as mathematics, early literacy, and logical thinking. The show is considered miraculous to some parents and caregivers of childrenautistic children, who find the simple sentences easier to communicate.

During breakes between each episode (there are 2 per show) the characters leave their home to talk to real toddlers.  They interact according to the theme of the episode.  One girl, Kate, appears often in these segments, and has the same voice as the girl in the closing credits who says, "This has been a Little Airplane Production," so one might assume she is related to one of the producers.

Main characters.
 Oobi - The show's main character, a young boy.  At the end of each episode, he looks at the screen and says, "Oobi, you, friends.";
 Uma - Oobi's younger sister. She loves singing, pretending, and chickens. Her catch phrase is "Nice."  She also says "Tasty-good" when she eats.
 Kako - Oobi's best friend. He usually wears a hat. His catch phrase is "Perfecto," the Spanish word for perfect.
 Grampu - Oobi and Uma's grandfather. His catch phrase is "Lovely.";

Other characters.
 Inka   Oobi's piano teacher and Grampu's love interest.
 Angus   Friend of Oobi and Kako from Oobi's piano class.  His eyes are underneath his hand instead of on top.
 Mrs Johnson   One of Oobi's neighbors.  She owns a cat (named Kitty) and has one of the best-decorated houses on Halloween.
 Maestru   Director of the singing group at the commmunity center.  His index finger is always pointing upward.
 Amy - a deaf girl who befriends Oobi and Kako in the park; they call her the "Cup-Ball Queen.";
 Tulla   Oobi and Uma's dance teacher.
 Popu and Mamu   Kako's parents.
 Paula   Uma's preschool teacher.
 Moppy, Tarrow and Fred   Uma's preschool classmates and friends.
 Bella   Grampu's friend, a greengrocer.
 Sheila   A young mother who Oobi and Grampu meet in the park.
 Sophie   Sheila's baby daughter, to whom Oobi attends for one day.
 Frieda   A young girl Oobi meets in the park. Unlike most other characters, Frieda is a foot.
 Frankie - Frieda's friend, also a foot.  He has a Southern accent and plays "Piggies" and "Shoes" with Frieda.
 Randy   Oobi and Uma's babysitter.  Uma doesn't get along with him at first ("Randy not Grampu -- hmmph!"), but thanks to some polka music they get along great.  He comes up with the nicknames "Oobi-Dude" and "Uma Zooma"; Uma in turn calls him "Randy Candy.";
 Nick   Owner of a Chinese restaurant where Uma learns how to use chopsticks.
 Dr. Rose   Oobi's pediatrician.
 Ray & Mimi   Singers in the community center singing group.
 Chauncy - A boy Oobi plays with (briefly) at Dr. Rose's office, in the waiting room.
 Ladies - The ladies seated with Grampu at the theater are Bella, Mamu, and Mrs. Johnson.  Bella brings grapes for everyone to snack on, and Grampu seems overly anxious for the show to begin.

Pets.
 George   Uma's class pet, a hamster.
 Oobi gets a pet turtle, which initially makes Kako jealous when a playdate becomes all about the turtle;
 Kako has a puppy, which Oobi "puppy-sits" one afternoon -- walking him, feeding him, bathing him, and eventually playing with him.

Songs.
 Theme song;
Oobi's like me, Oobi's like you -- 
Oobi's got a lot of big things that he's gonna do -- 
Uma's his sis, he's big, she's small --

Strangford Lough (; Loch Cuan in Irish) is a lough in County Down, Northern Ireland, separated from the Irish Sea by the Ards Peninsula. It is a popular tourist attraction noted for its fishing and the picturesque villages and townships which border its waters. The most notable of these is Portaferry, a small village of around 3,000 people.

The island studded sea lough is the largest inlet in the UK and Ireland, covering 150 square kilometres. Almost totally landlocked, the lough is approached from the Irish Sea through the eight kilometre long fast-running tidal narrows, which open out into more gentle waters where, it is said, there are 365 islands, one for every day of the year. In reality there are 70. Countless tidal rocky outcrops called pladdies litter the Lough and mudflats, along with marshes, rocks, bays and headlands. In 2007 a 1 megawatt underwater tidal electricity generator is to be installed in the narrows. Part of Northern Ireland's Environment & Renewable Energy Fund scheme, the generator will take advantage of the fast tidal flow in the lough which can be up to 4m per second.

The Lough is a conservation area and its abundant wildlife recognised internationally for its importance.

Strangford Lough is an important winter migration destination for many wading and sea birds. Animals commonly found in the lough include seals, basking sharks and Brent Geese. Three quarters of the world population of Brent Geese winter in the lough.

<doc id="62373" title="Alquerque" nonfiltered="707" processed="699" dbindex="1480712">


Alquerque (also known as Quirkat) is a board game that is thought to have originated in the Middle East. It is considered to have been the parent of the game Draughts (US, South Africa: Checkers).

History.

The oldest known board is unfinished and was carved into the roof of the temple at Qurna, Egypt, built around 1400 BCE. Friedrich Berger has argued that some of the diagrams at Qurna "cannot be dated" because Coptic crosses, used in the 1st century, are also carved there.

The game does not appear literature until late in the 10th century when the author Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani mentioned Quirkat in his 24 volume work Kitab al-Aghani ("Book of Songs"). This work, however, made no mention of the rules of the game. In Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations, R. C. Bell writes that "when the Moors invaded Spain they took El-quirkat with them". Rules are included in Libro de los juegos ("Book of games") commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile in the 13th century.

Spanish settlers in New Mexico introduced a four-player variant of Alquerque to the Zuni Indians.

Rules.


Before starting, each player places their twelve pieces in the two rows closest to them and in the two rightmost spaces in the center row. The game is played in turns, with one player taking white and the other black.

 A piece can move from its point to any adjacent point as long as that point is empty;
 A piece can jump over an opposing piece and remove it from the game, if that opposing piece is adjacent and the point beyond it is empty;
 Multiple capturing jumps are permitted, and indeed compulsory if possible;
 If a capture is possible it must be made, or else the piece is removed (or huffed);

The goal of the game is to eliminate the opponent's pieces.

Additional rules.
R. C. Bell developed additional rules, saying those given by Alfonso X "are not sufficient to play a game."
These extra rules are that:
 A piece cannot move backward (e.g., a piece in the middle of an empty board would have five available moves);
 No piece can return to a point it has previously occupied;
 Once a piece has reached the opponent's back row it can only move to capture opposing pieces;
 The game is won when either:
 The opponent has lost all of his pieces;
 None of the opponent's pieces are able to move;

Bell also includes a scoring system for rating games.

Julian Cobbing Hons (London); Ph.D (Lancaster) is an English historian, and professor of History at Rhodes University (Grahamstown, South Africa), known best for his groundbreaking research into Zulu culture of the early 19th century. 

Cobbing is regarded as the first historian to discredit conventional historical beliefs about the 'Mfecane' - a term used to describe a period of wars during the 1820's and 1830's that resulted in the emergence of the Zulu nation. In a paper published in the Journal of African History in 1988, Cobbing argued persuasively that the Mfecane had been the construct of Apartheid politicians and historians attempting to justify the longstanding oppression of black South Africans by their white colonisers. Instead of an internally-induced process of black-on-black destruction, Cobbing argued that much of the violence had been brought about by European slave traders and settlers, who had contracted local tribal leaders to capture slaves for sale at Delagoa Bay (now Maputo). The rise of the Zulu state, under Cobbing's hypothesis, was thus more of a defensive reaction to the slave-trading activities of other tribes in the region, than a process of active internal aggressive, as argued by most contemporary scholars.

Cobbing's hypothesis was highly controversial when first published. Indeed, several books and articles have been written focusing solely on rebutting Cobbing's arguments - most prominent perhaps is Roger B. Beck's "Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier", which featured a collection of articles attempting to refute Cobbing's contentions. Often now referred to as the "Cobbing controversy", historians are still very much divided on the issue of the emergence of the Zulu nation and the accuracy of conventional accounts of the Mfecane. Most agree however that Cobbing's analysis offered several key breakthroughs, and offered a robust alternative to accounts of the Mfecane that had been taught in school history curricula during Apartheid.

Cobbing spent two months as a visiting fellow at Oxford University in 2002. He currently lives in Grahamstown, South Africa, and lectures history at Rhodes University. Cobbing's current work focuses on a variety of subjects including the history of homo sapiens as a species and the modern world crisis.

<doc id="3222" title="Ahmed al-Haznawi" nonfiltered="713" processed="705" dbindex="1480718">


Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi (Arabic:                      ) (October 11, 1980   September 11, 2001) was named by the FBI as one of the hijackers of United Airlines flight 93 as part of the September 11, 2001 Attack. 

History.
Al-Haznawi was the son of an Saudi imam from al-Baha, an isolated and underdeveloped area, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers. 

Al-Haznawi announced he was leaving his family in 1999 to help fight in Chechnya, although his father forbade him. His father and brother, Abdul Rahman al-Haznawi, reportedly last heard from him in late 2000, after he made references to training in Afghanistan.

From November 27, 2000 through December 27, 2000, al-Haznawi was in Saudi Arabia for Ramadan.  It is theorized that during this trip, he may have initially told Saeed and Hamza Alghamdi about the operation.

Some time late in 2000, al-Haznawi traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi.  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Saeed Alghamdi, Hamza Alghamdi, Wail al-Shehri and Ahmed al-Nami.

2001.
A videotape released with The Wills of the New York and Washington Battle Martyrs, was aired on Al Jazeera on April 16, 2002. While the name beneath the speaker read al-Ghamdi, the image is of al-Haznawi speaking. Officials suggested that the name was merely a reference to his tribal affiliation.  The film was thought to have been made in March 2001.  In it, he talked about his plans to bring the "bloodied message" to America.  In September 2002, a similar tape made by Abdulaziz Alomari appeared.

On June 8 he arrived in Miami, Florida with fellow hijacker Wail al-Shehri.  He was one of 9 hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June of 2001.  He is believed to have moved in with Ziad Jarrah, who got a new apartment at 4641 Bougainvilla in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.

On June 25, Jarrah took al-Haznawi to Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale on advice of his landlord Charles Lisa.  Al-Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a small gash on his left calf.  While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase , the media briefly reported it as a sign of cutaneous anthrax and a possible link to the 2001 anthrax attacks, although FBI later addressed the rumors stating that "Exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been."

On July 10 al-Haznawi obtained a Florida driver's license, later obtaining another copy on September 7, 2001 by filling out a change-of-address form. Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses from different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.

On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines.  Jarrah and al-Haznawi both received their one-way tickets on September 5.

The attack.
On September 11, 2001, al-Haznawi boarded Flight 93.  Although he was selected for additional security by CAPPS and screened, he was able to board the flight without incident, with only his checked bags requiring extra screening for explosives.  

Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day and were told to be on the alert.  Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some believe may have signified an allegiance to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside - it is not known which hijacker this was.  Some passengers expressed doubt that the bomb was real.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising resulted in the plane crashing into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone aboard.

After the attacks, before the release of the FBI pictures of the hijackers, Arab News reported that al-Haznawi's brother Abdul Rahman had told Al-Madinah newspaper that a photograph published by local newspapers bore no resemblance to his brother.

<doc id="934177" title="First Great Awakening" nonfiltered="717" processed="709" dbindex="1480722">

The First Great Awakening was a religious movement among American colonial Protestants in the 1730s to 1740s. 

The Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. It resulted from powerful preaching that deeply affected listeners (already church members) with a deep sense of personal guilt and salvation by Christ.  Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion intensely personal to the average person by creating a deep sense of spiritual guilt and redemption. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees it as part of a "great international Protestant upheaval" that also created Pietism in Germany, the Evangelical Revival and Methodism in England.  It brought Christianity to the slaves and was an apocalyptic event in New England that challenged established authority. It incited rancor and division between the old traditionalists who insisted on ritual and doctrine and the new revivalists. It had a major impact in reshaping the Congregational, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and German Reformed denominations, and strengthened the small Baptist and Methodist denominations. It had little impact on Anglicans and Quakers. Unlike the Second Great Awakening that began about 1800 and which reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self awareness.

The revival began with Jonathan Edwards, a well-educated Congregationalist minister from Northampton, Massachusetts, who sought to build off Puritan Calvinist roots, but emphasizing the importance and power of immediate, personal religious experience. Edwards was a powerful speaker and attracted a large following; "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," while atypical for Edwards, is his most famous sermon.  The Methodist preacher George Whitefield, visiting from England, continued the movement, traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style, accepting everyone into his audiences.

The new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into religion in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. Ministers who used this new style of preaching were generally called "new lights", while the preachers of old were called "old lights". People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious manners and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation.

Trifoliate Orange (Poncirus trifoliata, syn. Citrus trifoliata) is a member of the family Rutaceae, closely related to Citrus, and sometimes included in that genus, being sufficiently closely related to allow it to be used as a rootstock for Citrus. It differs from Citrus in having deciduous, compound leaves, and pubescent (downy) fruit. It is native to northern China and Korea, and is also known as the Chinese Bitter Orange.

The plant is fairly hardy (USDA zone 5) and will tolerate moderate frost and snow, making a large shrub or small tree 4-8 m tall. Because of the relative hardiness of Poncirus, citrus grafted onto it are usually hardier than when grown on their own roots. 

Poncirus is recognisable by the large 3-5 cm spines on the shoots, and its deciduous leaves with three (rarely five) leaflets, typically with the middle leaflet 3-5 cm long, and the two side leaflets 2-3 cm long. The flowers are white, with pink stamens, 3-5 cm diameter, larger than those of true citrus but otherwise closely resembling them, except that the scent is much less pronounced than with true citrus. As with true citrus, the leaves give off a spicy smell when crushed.

The fruits are green, ripening to yellow, and 3-4 cm diameter, resembling a small orange, but with a finely downy surface. They are very bitter, not edible fresh, but can be made into marmalade, and when dried and powdered, they can be used as a condiment.

Greg "Diesel" Williams (born September 30, 1963) was a former champion Australian rules footballer with the Sydney Swans, Geelong Football Club and the Carlton Football Club.

Nicknamed "Diesel", he was one of the finest midfielders the game has ever seen. Williams is a dual Brownlow Medal winner (with the Sydney Swans in 1986 with 17 votes, a record low for the winner, and with Carlton in 1994 with 30 votes, close to the highest ever), a dual VFL/AFL Players Association MVP (with Carlton in 1994), and a Norm Smith Medal winner with Carlton in 1995. Often controversial, but always brilliant, Williams mastered the skill of the handball and turned it into a lethal attacking weapon, and his football brain was as good as anyone's in the history of the game. Williams holds the record for disposals in an AFL match with 51 (23 kicks and 28 handballs).

The most controversial moment of his career came in his final season. In Round 1 after the Carlton vs Essendon game, following a scuffle with longtime rival player Sean Denham, Williams was confronted by the umpire while being taunted by Denham. When the umpire went to step in, from the side, and out of Williams' view, he pushed the umpire in the chest/shoulder area to get the intruder out of his line of sight, unaware that it was an umpire. The push was not very forceful, the umpire merely needing a backward step to steady himself. The umpire did not see the incident as sufficient for a report. The AFL match reviewers saw it differently, and forced Williams to front the tribunal. The tribunal then proceeded to suspend Williams for nine games - bearing in mind that Phil Carmen was suspended for sixteen matches for headbutting an umpire. Carlton appealed the verdict, and it was overturned, allowing Williams to continue playing through the season. 

For whatever reason, the AFL decided to pursue Williams' case further through the Australian Legal System to try to get Williams' nine week suspension reinstated. Such a move had rarely, if ever, been made before in the VFL/AFL (outside of charges which were punishable under assault laws.) The matter continued long through the season, until the AFL had taken the matter before the High Court of Australia, the highest legal authority in Australia. The AFL eventually won the case after Round 16, four months after the incident had occurred, putting a sour end to Williams' 250-game career.

Footnote: Since that incident, the rules on umpire contact have been extensively changed, so that even rough contact with umpires is now seen as grounds for little more than a fine, in the tribunal's eyes.

Terry Griffiths (born October 16, 1947, Llanelli) is a retired Welsh snooker player. He is a former world champion, and is renowned for his slow, cautious style of play.

A former postman, Griffiths had a long amateur career, winning the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1975 and the English Amateur Championship in 1977 and 1978 before turning professional.

The then virtually unknown Griffiths shot to fame during the 1979 world championships. Interviewed after beating Eddie Charlton in a long semi-final, it suddenly dawned on him what he had done, and he said "I'm in the final now, you know!" in his broad native accent. He went on to beat Dennis Taylor 24-16 in the final, becoming world champion at his first attempt. 

The Crucible Curse struck a year later, as he lost his second-round match (which was then a 'first round' to the top 8 players) to Steve Davis, who went on to win his first title in 1981. He never repeated this, although he reached the final in 1988, losing to Steve Davis. He has also won The Masters beating Alex Higgins 9-5 in 1980 and the 1982 also beating Higgins in a classic 16-15 and won Pot Black in 1984. He also won the World Team Cup with Wales in 1979 and 1980.

Griffiths retired from professional play in 1997, and is now coach to Marco Fu, Stephen Hendry and, until recently, Mark Williams.  He also frequently commentates on snooker for the BBC.

<doc id="157342" title="Heptarchy" nonfiltered="722" processed="714" dbindex="1480727">




Heptarchy (Greek:  seven + realm) is a collective name applied to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the south and east of Great Britain during late antiquity and the early Middle Ages which eventually unified into Angle-land (England) (at this time the areas now known as Scotland and Wales were also divided into several smaller political units). The first recorded use of the term dates from 12th century in the English historian Henry of Huntingdon, and it has been in common use since the 16th century.

By convention the label is considered to cover the period from AD 500 to AD 850, approximately representing the period following the departure of Roman legions from Britain until the unification of the kingdoms under Egbert of Wessex.

The word heptarchy refers to the existence (as was thought) of seven kingdoms, which eventually merged to become the basis for the Kingdom of England; these were Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex and Wessex.  The period supposedly lasted until the seven kingdoms began to consolidate into larger units, but the actual events marking this transition are debatable.  At various times within the conventional period, certain rulers of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex (such as Penda of Mercia) claimed hegemony over larger areas of England; yet as late as Edwy and Edgar, it was still possible to speak of separate kingdoms within the English population.

In reality the end of the Heptarchy was a gradual process.  The 9th century Viking raids that led to the establishment of a Danish-controlled enclave at York, and ultimately to the Danelaw, gained considerable advantage from the petty rivalries between the old kingdoms.  The need to unite against the common enemy was recognised, such that by the time Alfred of Wessex resisted the Danes in the early 10th century, he did so essentially as the leader of an Anglo-Saxon nation.  Successive kings of Wessex (and especially Athelstan) progressively reinforced the English unitary state, until the old constituent kingdoms in effect became irrelevant.

Recent research has revealed that some of the Heptarchy kingdoms (notably Essex and Sussex) did not achieve the same status as the others.  Conversely, there also existed alongside the seven kingdoms a number of other political divisions which played a more significant role than previously thought.  Such were the kingdoms (or sub-kingdoms) of: Bernicia and Deira within Northumbria; Lindsey in present-day Lincolnshire; the Hwicce in the southwest Midlands; the Magonsæte or Magonset, a sub-kingdom of Mercia in what is now Herefordshire; the Wihtwara, a Jutish kingdom on the Isle of Wight, originally as important as the Cantwara of Kent; the Middle Angles, a group of tribes based around modern Leicestershire, later conquered by the Mercians; the Hæstingas (around the town of Hastings in Sussex); and the Gewissæ, a Saxon tribe in southern Hampshire later developing into the kingdom of Wessex.

Certainly the term Heptarchy has been considered unsatisfactory since the early 20th century, and many professional historians no longer use it, feeling that it does not accurately describe the period to which it refers.  However, it is still sometimes used as a label of convenience for a phase in the development of England.

John Denison (1917-2001) was a famous ice road engineer who operated in the Northwest Territories, Canada in the 1950s-1970s.

He was a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and also a veteran of World War II. In 1946, he came north to work at the RCMP detachment in Yellowknife where he was involved in the search for a missing trapper. During this ordeal, Denison he nearly lost his fingers and toes to frost bite. He quit the RCMP in 1947 but stayed in the north and worked on the Cat Trains supplying the mining camps with equipment. He eventually became associated with Byers Transport Limited, with whom he engineered a network of winter ice roads throughout the Northwest Territories to service various mines (including Port Radium, Discovery Mine, Tundra Mine, and Rayrock Mine. His major interest was hauling around large buildings on ice roads between mining camps. Denison's road into the Tundra Mine was an engineering feat of the day, as not many people in the 1960s would have believed an ice road into the very hostile and cold climate of the Canadian Arctic, beyond the Treeline, would be feasible.

The exploits of John Denison were the topic of a book in the 1970s by Edith Iglauer entitled "Denison's Ice Road".

In 1998, John Denison was awarded the Order of Canada for his work on the ice roads in the 1950s-1970s. John Denison passed away in 2001 at the age of 84.

Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 (see 1975 in music) album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson.  A concept album, Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive preacher, on the run from the law after killing his wife.  Sparse and jumbled, with brief, poetic lyrics, no one involved in the creation of the album thought it would sell well.  In spite of its inaccessibility, Red Headed Stranger was a blockbuster among both country music and mainstream audiences, going multiplatinum and making Nelson one of the biggest stars in country.  In 2003, the same year the album was ranked #184 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , Nelson sang background vocals and added some guitar to a remake of the album done by Carla Bozulich of the alt-country band, the Geraldine Fibbers.

The first track, "Time of the Preacher", was memorably used in the 1985 television drama Edge of Darkness.

<doc id="6853263" title="Sealocrete" nonfiltered="734" processed="726" dbindex="1480739">
Sealocrete is the UK's leading independent manufacturer of lightside building materials, chemicals and construction products. 

Established in 1934 the company's innovative waterproofing, dustproofing and coloured concrete admixtures played a major role in construction in the Second World War and in rebuilding postwar Britain. Sealocrete produces over 90% of its products in-house so that it can maintain quality control and offer superior customer service. 

Sealocrete products include concrete admixtures, adhesives, decorating products, floorings, wall coatings and concrete repair products. Sealocrete products are available through Builders Merchants across the UK. 


 History .

From Small Beginnings
Sealocrete was founded in Middlesex by Mr Eric Haes in 1934. At the outset there were just two full time staff and a part time assistant, and the product range comprised of just three materials   one of which was the forerunner of today s highly successful Sealocrete Double Strength Premix. By 1937 the name of Sealocrete was already established in the building industry.

Innovative Products To Aid The War Effort
In 1939 Sealocrete moved to larger factory and office premises in London. Between 1939   1945 many of Sealocrete s products were used to assist with the War Effort. For example, Sealocrete was the first to supply admixtures to enable concreting work to be carried out successfully during frosty weather. This enabled a concrete roof to be constructed on an army camp in Richmond Park during the icy 1940 winter. Sealocrete products were used to dustproof and waterproof aircraft, arnament factories and Ordinance depots. The concrete passage floors under Whitehall, which connected the wartime offices of the late Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill and his staff were also dustproofed by Sealocrete.

Sealocrete Waterbar and Sealocrete Double Strength Premix were used as waterproofers in the construction of the Mulberry Harbour, which played an important part in the landing of Allied troops in France in 1944. Sealocrete Double Strength Premix was also used to waterproof concrete rafts and the internal renderings and mortar joints of storage tanks built to provide water for fire fighting during the blitz. Then, as now, Sealocrete provided full technical support for these innovative projects.

Rebuilding Britain
Sealocrete also played an important part in the rebuilding of post war Britain. Sealocrete s Sealotone Cement Colours were widely used to create the coloured concrete floors specified by the Government for the council homes built in the post war period. The demand for Sealotone was high and Builders Merchants throughout the country began to stock the product. This was the start of the close links with the Merchant trade, which Sealocrete continues to maintain.

Shortly after the Diamond Jubilee of Sealocrete in 1984, Mr Haes died and Sealocrete was the subject of a Management Buyout. In 1988, control of the company was bought by the Nullfire Group based in Coventry.

A Period of Expansion
Meanwhile, in 1971 Mr Michael Kelly founded PLA Products in Rochdale, where six products were produced for sale to Builders Merchants. In 1974 the number of products manufactured and the number of Builders Merchants customers supplied by PLA Products increased so much that the company moved to a 12,000 square foot factory at Norden, Rochdale. This was later expanded to include a 15,000 square foot warehouse. 

During the next ten years, PLA Products  continued to grow. Glazing and DIY products and Sealants were added to the product range, and the Builders Merchants product range was also extended. By 1984 the company outgrew its 27,000 square foot facility and acquired 60,000 square foot premises on four acres, which it currently occupies.

In 1992 PLA Products purchased Sealocrete from the Nullfire Group creating the existing company. Sealocrete s operations were moved to Rochdale and a 17,500 square foot distribution centre was purchased.

In March 1998 Sealocrete decided to add paint to its product range to enhance the offering to its customers. As the company has a policy of manufacturing its products in-house Sealocrete purchased a paint manufacturing business in Wrexham.

The story gained notoriety because U.S. President George W. Bush was reading it with Sarasota, Florida schoolchildren in Emma E. Booker Elementary School at the time at which then-White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card informed him of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 

Plot.


"The Pet Goat" is the story of a girl's pet goat which eats everything in its path.  The girl's parents want to get rid of the goat, but she defends it.  In the end, the goat becomes a hero when it butts a car robber into submission.  A sample passage:


"A girl got a pet goat. She liked to go running with her pet goat. She played with her goat in her house. She played with her goat in her yard. But the goat did some things that made the girl's dad mad. The goat ate things. He ate cans and he ate canes.  He ate pans and he ate panes. He even ate capes and caps."




Bush's 2001 reading of the book.

Bush's critics, notably Michael Moore in his film Fahrenheit 9/11, have argued that the fact that Bush continued to read the book after being notified of the attacks shows that he was indecisive.  His supporters, on the other hand, contend that he was able to project calm in a crisis, and not disturb the schoolchildren by interrupting his visit. Actor Charlie Sheen, who believes that the Bush administration orchestrated the attacks has said "It seems to me that upon the revelation of that news that the secret service would grab the President as if he was on fire and remove him from that room." At 9:07 a.m. Andrew Card whispers in Bush's ear that 'America is under attack' and immediately leaves without waiting for any kind of response from the President. Critics have asked if this is all the information Bush needed to fully comprehend the situation. After spending about 20 minutes with the children, Bush was scheduled to give a short press conference at about 9:30. At the press conference inside the same school Bush makes his first speech about the attacks and is never evacuated by the Secret Service. Many Bush supporters point out that according to The Washington Times correspondent Bill Sammon, Bush's Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was in the back of the classroom holding a pad on which he had written "DON'T SAY ANYTHING YET."

On the evening of 9/11 Bush stated: 

"Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington, D.C. to help with local rescue efforts."

In Orlando Florida on December 4, 2001, Bush explained: 

"Actually I was in a classroom talking about a reading program that works. And I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower -- the TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself, and I said, "There's one terrible pilot." And I said, "It must have been a horrible accident." But I was whisked off there - I didn't have much time to think about it."


Again at a town meeting in Ontario in January 2002: 

"first of all, when we walked into the classroom, I had seen this plane fly into the first building. There was a TV set on. And you know, I thought it was pilot error and I was amazed that anybody could make such a terrible mistake. And something was wrong with the plane"


Both statements, however, have been criticized as impossible. The first plane to hit the tower was not televised.

Shortly after Moore's movie opened in theaters, Amazon.com sold out of all copies of the book, with a one-month backorder, and users posted satirical reviews of the book, for example: "Presidential material, through and through!   The tempo, the choice of words, and the layout on each page captured my imagination so much that it took me about seven minutes to recover my bearings." Amazon has since deleted these reviews though new ones continue to appear. 

Osama bin Laden made reference to the story in a videotaped speech released just prior to the 2004 U.S. presidential election (see 2004 Osama bin Laden video):

"We had agreed with the (Sept. 11) overall commander Mohamed Atta, may God rest his soul, to carry out all operations in 20 minutes -- before Bush and his administration could take notice. It never occurred to us that the commander in chief of the American forces would leave 50,000 citizens in the two towers to face those horrors alone at a time when they most needed him because he thought listening to a child discussing her goat and its ramming was more important than the planes and their ramming of the skyscrapers. This gave us three times the time needed to carry out the operations, thanks be to God." 


Popular culture.

 The incident was parodied on MADtv, where inside Bush's mind he is thinking that the pet goat is attacking America.

 When Andrew Card resigned from the White House staff, Jon Stewart mocked the fact that he had informed the president of the 9/11 attacks. He claimed (satirically) that The Daily Show had audio as well as video wherein Card rushes over to the president and says, "We're under attack, but keep reading, I must know what happens to the goat!";

 In the 2006 parody film Scary Movie 4, the President, played by Leslie Nielsen, is notified by one of his secretaries that aliens have attacked America, in a similar classroom setting to where President Bush was reading The Pet Goat to the children. Nielsen's character, reading The Little Duck to the children, says to his secretary "Hang on a second, I just want to see what happens to the duck".

 In the Eminem animated video 'Mosh', a presidential-looking figure reads to children in a schoolroom from an upside-down book entitled 'My Pet Goat'.

<doc id="3263036" title="Succession (conflict)" nonfiltered="744" processed="736" dbindex="1480749">

In the Conflict of Laws, the subject of succession deals with all procedural matters relevant to estates containing a "foreign element" whether that element consists of the identity of the deceased, those who may inherit or the location of property. The relevant choice of law rules often distinguish both between the administration of the estate and the succession to it, and between the succession to movable and immovable property, albeit that many states are considering amendment so that a single law will apply to all administration and succession issues. Such uniformity is considered more desirable than the present arrangement that often requires different laws for movables and immovables. 

Definitions.
In civil law systems, there are two types of property. Out of Comity, the Conflict of Laws has adopted the civil law terminology as the standard: 
Immovables is the equivalent of "real property" in common law systems, i.e. it is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface.  ;
All other property is considered movables, i.e. the equivalent of personal property or personalty in common law systems, and this property is either tangible or intangible, i.e. it is either physical property that can be touched like a computer, or it is an enforceable right like a patent, some other form of intellectual property or a chose in action such as shares, bank accounts, etc.

Connecting factors.
Domicile.
In common law states, every person acquires a domicile of origin which, if the individual is legitimate will be that of their father. During their minority, children have a domicile of dependency which will change to follow the controlling parent. After reaching the age of majority, young adults can establish a new domicile of choice in another state but this requires long-term residence accompanied by an intention to remain in the new state indefinitely so it is quite difficult to change the domicile of origin. Hence, the lex domicilii is favoured as the connecting factor for all aspects of status and capacity for all those who may become involved in resolving disputes over the distribution of the deceased' property.
Nationality.
Civil law states use either the concept of nationality or habitual residence as the connecting factor, i.e. the principles are the same as for domicile but the way in which they are applied is less rigourous so it a nationality can be changed by naturalisation and a new habitual residence established with fewer delays and technical difficulties. As above, the lex patriae determines status and capacity.

The lex successionis.
As with a choice of law clause or forum selection clause in contract, a testator may nominate a law or laws by which both to interpret and test the validity of the will, and to govern administration and succession, but there must be a real connection between the choice(s) and the location of assets or beneficiaries, and the choices must invoke provisions of law that are consistent with any mandatory provisions either in the lex fori or the lex situs. If a choice of law is made in respect of part of an estate, it is assumed that the deceased wishes that law to apply to the whole of the estate unless there is clear evidence to the contrary or mandatory principles of law are relevant to cover the residual assets and their inheritance.
The lex situs.
The general rule is that the lex situs applies to determine all issues relating to title to immovable property and some issues relating to movables.
The lex fori.
The courts in which lawsuits are initiated will tend to prefer the application of the lex fori because the fact of the litigation suggests that some aspect of the administration is to be effected within the jurisdiction. There may also be some claims arising from public policy if the forum court considers the application of the lex causae is going to produce a significantly unjust result.

Administration.
In most states, the lex fori regulates the administration by Personal Representatives appointed to act within the jurisdiction of forum irrespective of the deceased's lex domicilii but the rights of beneficiaries is a matter for the lex successionis.

Testamentary capacity.
States differ in their view on the sophistication of today's youth and whether they are old enough to own property and to dispose of that property by a will. The debate seems to moving to a general stance that it is not rational to distinguish between the ages at which full capacity is achieved. Hence, if one is old enough to get married, one should equally be old enough to provide for spouse and children. Because there are fewer discriminations against individuals who have physical disabilities, many states also permit mouthwriting, footwriting, and similar kinds of writing that enable the disabled to communicate. There is less agreement on whether videotape, digital, and electronic wills should be admissible to probate. Although testators may not have the physical ability to write, e.g. because they are hospitalised and close to death, there is concern that digital and electronic forms are too easily manipulated and altered. Hence, unless there is adequate evidence to exclude forgery, the courts are reluctant to admit such wills to probate.

Succession.
In some states, there is complete freedom for testators to leave their assets to whomever or whatever purpose they wish to promote. But the majority of states allow a surviving spouses, children and dependents of a locally-based deceased to claim against the estate if the will fails to make adequate provision for them. Some proactively limit the testator's capacity by imposing minimum provisions for surviving dependents.

Although these rules are relatively clear in their operation during the subsistence of the marriage, determining the effect of either a divorce or nullity decree is more problematic if, by its existence or the terms of any order made, it purports to adjust the property entitlements of the other spouse. For example, suppose that a husband obtains a nullity decree in a state declaring the marriage to have been void ab initio. If that decree is recognised across state boundaries, the effect would be to remove any claim that the supposed "wife" would otherwise have had. As to the testator, all questions of status and capacity should be determined by the personal law at the time the decree is granted. Thus, if the decree is recognised, either the status will be modified so that the testator was never married and this will retrospectively validate or invalidate previous dispositions, or the testator is now single and able to dispose of his assets in any way permitted by his personal law. But as to the putative wife, any entitlement she will have will be determined by whether the lex situs of any "matrimonial" assets recognises the decree. If the decree is not recognised, she will remain a wife for the purposes of succession protected by the local system of mandatory heirship or community property laws.
Immovables.
The general rule is that the lex situs governs the succession to immovables regardless of the deceased's personal law, i.e. lex domicilii, lex patriae or habitual residence. So, for example, land in France belonging to an English domiciliary will pass according to the French law on forced heirship, but complications may arise because some states apply renvoi to succession cases. Hence, English law would apply the lex situs to immovables located outside the jurisdiction but if that foreign law (say. as in Spain) applies the deceased's lex patriae and rejects any renvoi, English law would be applied if, under Spanish law, the deceased had an English nationality.
Movables.
The general view is that the deceased's personal law will determine succession to movables no matter where they are located unless a lex situs provides otherwise. Thus, for example, succession to the estate of a French testator leaving movables situated in England would be governed by French law and the French rules of forced heirship would apply given that English law does not limit the application of the lex domicilii on this point.

The formal validity of wills.
A will will usually be considered valid if it was properly executed according to the law of the place where:
it was executed; or;
the testator was domiciled either when the will was executed or at the time of death (the policy of most laws is to uphold the validity of wills to respect the demonstrated intention of the testator so if validity is established under either law, it will be deemed valid); or;
the testator was a national (either at the time of execution or death); or;
the testator was habitually resident (either at the time of execution or death).

The essential validity of wills.
Even though a will may be formally valid, it may not be essentially valid, e.g. as above, the succession to movables will be governed by the deceased's personal law, and if there is a limitation on testamentary capacity, the terms of a will breaching that law will be invalid even if it was validly executed. Similarly, a will validly executed in one state cannot override mandatory provisions in the lex situs. This is an application of the principle of evasion because otherwise a husband who wished to evade laws imposing community property could defeat the claims of a wife by the simple expedient of executing a formally valid will in a state that did not contain such a law.

Intestacy.
Where there is no will, the appointment and duties of Personal Representatives will be determined by the deceased's personal law. Succession to an intestate's estate will also be governed by his or her personal law and the lex situs of the assets.

Harmonisation.
The Hague Convention of 1 August 1989 on the Law Applicable to Succession to the Estates of Deceased Persons  applies to:
a) the form of dispositions of property upon death;
b) capacity to dispose of property upon death;
c) issues relating to matrimonial property;
d) property rights, interests or assets created or transferred otherwise than by succession, such as in joint ownership with right of survival, pension plans, insurance contracts, or arrangements of a similar nature.
It nominates as the lex causae for succession the law of habitual resident if that was also the deceased's nationality. If the deceased had been resident in a state for at least five years and no other state has a better claim, the law of residence applies. In all other cases, the personal law with the best claim applies. See also the "European Commission's Green Paper Consulting on Succession with an International Dimension" by
David Hayton 

Australia.
It is noted that the rules in South Australia differ from those applying in the other federated states, but it is proposed that a uniform system should be developed. See Issues Paper 21 (2002) - "Uniform Succession Laws: Recognition of interstate and foreign grants of probate and letters of administration."

<doc id="3239291" title="Fracture toughness" nonfiltered="745" processed="737" dbindex="1480750">


In materials science, fracture toughness is a property which describes the ability of a material containing a crack to resist fracture, and is one of the most important properties of any material for virtually all design applications. It is denoted KIc and has the units of . Fracture toughness is a quantitative way of expressing a material's resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present. If a material has a large value of fracture toughness it will probably undergo ductile fracture. Brittle fracture is very characteristic of materials with a low fracture toughness value.

Table of values.
Here are some typical values of fracture toughness for various materials:



Sources.

Internal and external flaws act as stress risers, raising the effective stress normal to the crack plane. More important for the purpose of predicting instability, we can estimate the elastic stress field in the neighbourhood of a crack tip and thereby determine the elastic strain energy that would be released if the crack were to grow. In order for the crack to propagate spontaneously this energy must exceed the surface energy of the (two) new crack surfaces. When there is plastic deformation at the crack tip (as occurs most often in metals) the energy to propagate the crack may increase by several orders of magnitude. This total energy release rate is given the symbol GIc, where the Roman number I (II or III) indicates the way the crack opens (e.g. whether there is a twisting component or not) and c denotes criticality   the crack will only propagate when GIc exceeds some critical value. In short, when

elastic energy released = surface energy created;

For ductile metals GIc is around 50 to 200 kJ/m2, for brittle metals it is usually 1-5 and for glasses and brittle polymers it is almost always less than 0.5.

More significant adjustments to this kind of calculation take account of the shape of the flaw and its relationship to the shape and size of the structure. This has led to the concept of a stress intensity factor. Analogously to GIc, at criticality this is given the symbol KIc. Typical values are 150 MN/m3/2 for ductile (very tough) metals, 25 for brittle ones and 1-10 for glasses and brittle polymers. Notice the different units used by GIc and KIc. Engineers tend to use the latter as an indication of toughness. Where there is extensive plastic deformation this treatment has to be modified because the plastic zone at the tip of the crack consumes the major part of the work of fracture and modifies the elastic strain field in the crack tip region:
    
elastic energy released = surface energy + plastic deformation energy;

Conjoint Action.

There are number of instances where this picture of a critical crack is modified by corrosion. Thus, fretting corrosion occurs when a corrosive medium is present at the interface between two rubbing surfaces. Fretting (in the absence of corrosion) results from the disruption of very small areas that bond and break as the surfaces undergo friction, often under vibrating conditions. The bonding contact areas deform under the localised pressure and the two surfaces gradually wear away. Fracture mechanics dictates that each minute localised fracture has to satisfy the general rule that the elastic energy released as the bond fractures has to exceed the work done in plastically deforming it and in creating the (very tiny) fracture surfaces. This process is enhanced when corrosion is present, not least because the corrosion products act as an abrasive between the rubbing surfaces.

Fatigue is another instance where cyclical stressing, this time of a bulk lump of metal, causes small flaws to develop. Ultimately one such flaw exceeds the critical condition and fracture propagates across the whole structure. The 'fatigue life' of a component is the time it takes for criticality to be reached, for a given regime of cyclical stress. Corrosion fatigue is what happens when a cyclically stressed structure is subjected to a corrosive environment at the same time. This not only serves to initiate surface cracks but (see below) actually modifies the crack growth process. As a result the fatigue life is shortened, often considerably.

Stress-Corrosion Cracking (SCC).


This phenomenon is the unexpected sudden failure of normally ductile metals subjected to a constant tensile stress in a corrosive environment. Certain austenitic stainless steels and aluminium alloys crack in the presence of chlorides, mild steel cracks in the present of alkali (boiler cracking) and copper alloys crack in ammoniacal solutions (season cracking). Worse still, high-tensile structural steels crack in an unexpectedly brittle manner in a whole variety of aqueous environments, especially chloride. With the possible exception of the latter, which is a special example of hydrogen cracking, all the others display the phenomenon of subcritical crack growth, i.e. small surface flaws propagate (usually smoothly) under conditions where fracture mechanics predicts that failure should not occur. That is, in the presence of a corrodent, cracks develop and propagate well below KIc. In fact, the subcritical value of the stress intensity, designated as KIscc, may be less than 1% of KIc, as the following table shows:



The subcritical nature of propagation may be attributed to the chemical energy released as the crack propagates. That is,

elastic energy released + chemical energy = surface energy + deformation energy;

The crack initiates at KIscc and thereafter propagates at a rate governed by the slowest process, which most of the time is the rate at which corrosive ions can diffuse to the crack tip. As the crack advances so K rises (because crack length appears in the calculation of stress intensity). Finally it reaches KIc , whereupon fast fracture ensues and the component fails. One of the practical difficulties with SCC is its unexpected nature. Stainless steels, for example, are employed because under most conditions they are 'passive', i.e. effectively inert. Very often one finds a single crack has propagated while the rest of the metal surface stays apparently unaffected.

Arkan Mohammad Ghafil Al Karim is a citizen of Iraq, held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba. 
Al Karim's Guantanamo detainee ID number is 653.

Combatant Status Review Tribunal.


Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror.  This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status.

Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.  The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant.

Al Karim chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

allegations.

The allegations against Al Karim in the "Summary of Evidence" presented to his Tribunal were:
The detainee traveled to Kabul sometime in later 2001.
The detainee was identified as an Iraqi national affiliated with al Qaida.
The detainee resided at a guesthouse near Kabul, Afghanistan, frequented by people training at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.
Al Farouq is best known as a basic training facility for jihadists.  Training at this facility was conducted in four phases: small arms firing; physical conditioning, map reading, topography, and explosive devices.
The detainee received military training in the Iraqi army.
The detainee trained with the following weapons: AK 47 rifle, 7.62 mm PK machine gun and mortars - 82mm, 120mm, and 160mm.
The detainee acknowledges that in 1999 he fought on the front lines against the Northern Alliance with the Taliban near Mir Bachel Kawt.
The detainee was imprisoned by Northern Alliance and subsequently transferred to United States authority.

testimony.

Al Karim said he deserted from the Iraqi Army in 1994.  He had flect first to Kurdistan for a year, and then moved to Iran, where he had to work without official papers.  He had worked in a shoe factory.  But had left that area when the factory was raided by Iranian immigration officials.  He had fled to a city that was near the Afghan border.  When immigration officials captured him and a group of Afghan refugees he felt it was safer to represent himself as another Afghan, rather than as an Iraqi.  Thus he was deported to Afghanistan in 1999.

Al Karim said he was arrested by Arabs associated with the Taliban on February 15 2000, because they believed he was an American spy.  He said that he was denounced by an associate named 
Abdul Rahim Jenko who owed him money for a loan to buy shoes.  Al Karim was in a Taliban prison from February 15 2000 until the prison was taken over by coalition forces, and he was transferred to US custody.  Al Karim said that Jenko, too, had been transferred to American custody when the Taliban prison was captured, and had also been tranferred to Guantanamo.


witnesses.

Al Karin called two witnesses: Abdul Zahir and Janko.  Both witnesses testified that they had known Al Karim in Kabul, and that he had been arrested by the Taliban because they suspected he was an American spy.

Zahir testified that he and Al Karim had stayed at 
Abdul Habib Iraqi's guesthouse.

Janko testified that Al Karim was the only person who had been kind to him when he came to Kabul, as a refugee, and that Al Karim had bought him a pair of shoes.  When asked why the Taliban tortured him into denouncing Al Karin he said he didn't really know why, except that they were suspicious of anything different.

Newspaper articles.

Al Karim's Personal Representative submitted three newspaper articles he had found on the internet, that supported Al Karim's story that he was imprisoned as an American spy.  Those articles were entitled:
 Arabs Arrested in Afghanistan Claim That They Are Working for the United States ;
 Arabs Spy Unfolds US-Israel Intelligence Plan ;
 Taliban tying US citizen on spying charges ;

Administrative Review Board hearing.

Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual Administrative Review Board hearings.  The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".

They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.

Al Karim chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.

Factors for and against Al Karim's continued detention.

Most detainees transcripts break the factors down, into separate sections, like "training" and "commitment".
These classifications were not preserved when the factors were read into evidence.

The detainee stayed at the  Arabic House  in Kabul with to 35 other fighters.  He was given a Kalashnikov rifle and performed guard duties.  He took orders from Abdel Aziz and Abut Hamza, who received their orders from Abdul al Hadi al Iraqi.
Abdul Hadi al Iraqi was a member of al Qaida and part of Usama Bin Laden s inner circle.  He commanded 200 Arab and Taliban fighters in Kabul, and was also responsible for sending Arab fighters to Chechnya.
In 1999, the detainee fought on the front line north of Kabul with an Arab unit for approximately three and a half months.  The Taliban supported this unit with food, drinks, ammunition, and a truck.  Al Qaida supported the fighters by providing logistical support and access to the Walam Bacha safe house in Kabul for rest and relaxation.
The detainee was a weapons engineer on the front lines, repairing small arms for the Taliban.
The detainee was in charge of Usama Bin Laden s weapon depots in Kandahar and Kabul form 1999 to 2000.
The detainee was responsible for the storage of cash, weapons, and ammunition for Usama Bin Laden.
The detainee had control of the keys to the weapons storage container at Gulam Bacha guesthouse in Kabul.  The detainee was also a trainer of soldiers in the tactics of entering a structure and arresting or detaining persons in the given structure.
The detainee claimed he was an al Qaida member who worked for Usama Bin Laden for 13 years conducting weapons maintenance.
The detainee claimed he was an expert in the areas of poisons, explosives, martial arts, and weapons.  The detainee claimed to have carried out an operation in Kuwait in which he blew up a building he believed was being used by the Israelis.  He also boasted of kidnapping a Kuwaiti Intelligence Office to gain the release of one of his comrades being held in a Kuwaiti prison.  The detainee claimed to have taken up jihad in the Philippines, Chechnya and Bosnia.
The detainee claimed he was a mechanical engineer for weapons with al Qaida.  He claimed he went to London for al Qaida.
The detainee claimed he was an al Qaida member who ate frequently with Usama Bin Laden.  He also stated he had specific knowledge of the al Qaida organization and the attacks on the World Trade Center.  He claimed he traveled to England, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia.  The detainee claimed he was a third-degree black belt in Tai Kwon Do, which he learned while in Malaysia.
While in the Iraqi Army, the detainee received training on the following weapons: AK-47, 7.62mm PK machine gun, and 82mm, 120mm and 160mm mortars.
The detainee received specialized training in poisons at the al Farouq Camp.
After fleeing the Iraqi Army and being held by the Kurds, the detainee said he provided a fake last name of Al Hashimi.
The detainee s kunya nickname was Islam.
Islam Abdul Rahman Al Hashimi is a known al Qaida member and chemical specialist.  On of al Hashimi s associates is Abu Bassam, an Iraqi businessman who supported Al Hashimi financially.
The detainee had a close relationship with an Iraqi Kurd known as Abu Bassam.
Abu Bassam was a member of Usama Bin Laden s inner circle.  He met frequently with al Qaida members and Bin Laden, and knew about the 11 September 2001 attack on the United States prior to its occurrence.
An al Qaida member identified the detainee as an al Qaida contact in Kabul.
The detainee claimed to be an understudy of Sheik Abdullah Azzam.
Abdullah Azzam led a successful campaign to recruit rich young Saudis using a three-tape series he released in 1987.  He called individuals to follow Usama Bin Laden by imitating his devotion to Islamic jihad, both physically and financially.
Abdul Rahim Janko was tortured by al Qaida and eventually told them he and the detainee were spies for the United States.  The detainee was also tortured by al Qaida, but never admitted to being a spy.
The Taliban imprisoned the detainee for two years at Sarpoosa prison.  During Ramadan when the Taliban fell, the detainee was transferred to Kabul and was imprisoned for three months.
The Northern Alliance turned the detainee over ot the Americans on 8 June 2002.
The detainee claimed he was not a member of al-Qaida, never swore bayat to Usama Bin Laden, received no training or fought for al Qaida, and he was not an expert on poisons.
The detainee believes his enemies have wrong accused him of being an al Qaida member.

The Colt Commando (also referred to as CAR-15 or XM177) is a general name for a wide array of shortened and modified AR-15/M16 firearms developed primarily in the late 20th century. They are a family of gas-operated, locking bolt 5.56 x 45 mm carbines, and were developed and produced by Colt manufacturing, mainly for U.S. Special Forces, starting in the 1960s. 

The moniker "Commando" has been used to describe Colt s ultra-short carbine variants, as well as, "pre-A2 configuration" or "pre-M4" in general.  The first weapon in this ultra-short category began production in 1966/7 for Special Operations units during the Vietnam war.  By the end of the conflict, it had been used by members of various elite units, and had been given a slew of official and semi-official designations, in addition to the informal names it received in the field.  The CAR-15/Commando/XM177 family has one of the most complicated array of variants and names among US service firearms. Popular monikers for the family, such as 'CAR-15', or 'XM-177', have much more complicated meanings when talking about actual, specific, versions of the family.   

In the mid-1960's Colt created and sold an ultra-short carbine variant of the M16 for the US Army. It looked much like a miniaturized M16A1 rifle, and featured a retracting buttstock modeled after the full rifle stock.  With a 10 in (254 mm) barrel, muzzle blast soon became a major issue, and while the initial variants were equipped with the same flash hiders as A1 rifles, special "moderators" were quickly created. 

The current iteration   the M16A2 Commando   is similar in design and has many interoperable components with the M4 carbine and the M16A2 rifle; the Commando being the shortest and most compact of the three weapons

Early models & naming.

The original "Commando" was created when Colt began developing the AR-15 pattern, newly acquired from Armalite.  The need for a shorter handier weapon had been expressed by a number of forces engaged in the expanding conflict in South East Asia in the mid 1960s, and Colt responded with an ultra-short variant as part of its new CAR-15 family, the Model 607 CAR-15 Commando Model Submachine Gun. Note that calling it a submachine gun was a new trend in submachine gun (SMG) naming, as previous SMGs were all chambered for pistol, rather than rifle ammunition. Classifying very short assault rifles as SMGs has been common practice in a number of firearm books, though it is not universally accepted. By the time the contract for rifles was signed by the Army in 1966, CAR-15 SMG, or just CAR-15, and 'Commando' were the two main names in use for the Colt Model 607. In early field manuals, the name Submachine Gun, 5.56 mm, CAR-15 can be found.  By 1967 and later a slew of new variants would be developed, and were given various designations by the US Army and the USAF.

In January 1967 the family got a type classification- XM177/E1 submachine guns, which featured improvements on the earlier models. More variants would get even more names using Air Force nomenclature ('GAU prefix'). The CAR-15 Survival Rifle, which differed from the basic CAR-15 Commando, was a version Colt developed for the Air Force, but they did not accept it. 



Troops in the field ended up simply referring to it as CAR-15, rather than CAR-15 SMG, or Colt Commando.  While CAR-15, or Colt Automatic Rifle-15, was to be used for an entire family of Colt patterned AR-15 type weapons including 2 rifles, 2 Heavy Barreled rifles or HBARs, a 16 in (406 mm) carbine, and the ultra-short 10 in (254 mm) gun, it quickly fell by the wayside.  CAR-15 has since been used to describe later models, such as A1 configured or pre-M4 type carbines.  CAR-15 and Colt Commando are in the common lexicon for these breed of weapons, though care must be taken when talking about specific variants. Really, pre-XM177 models are those best described with CAR-15, and even then it should be noted that they were the "Submachine Gun" members of that family.  CAR-15 has also persisted in the civilian market as a term for semi-automatic carbines of the AR-15/M16 pattern. 

The choice between CAR-15 (or CAR-15 submachine gun), XM177, Colt Commando, or CAR-15 SMG, varies between sources when trying to describe the whole family of variants.  Commando is probably the most accurate when talking about the family as a whole, as this has been the a major part of Colt factory nomenclature (Colt Defense offers a 'M4 Commando' even in 2005 .  However, when dealing in specifics, specific variant models should be specified as their differences may be slight, but are important in understanding development.  

The 16" carbine, the Colt Model 605, was built in 3 variants, one without the forward assist, one with, and one with a four-position burst function.  This function found its way onto a variant of the ultra-short "Commando" family, as well as, an HBAR in addition to the 605.  A small number of 605s were procured for the US Navy SEALs and used by them in South East Asia.  Despite what was regarded to be a generally positive response, development progressed on 607 patterned weapons.

The Model 607 itself looks much like a miniaturized M16, featuring short older style triangular handguards and a buttstock that while retractable was similar in shape to that of the full size rifles.  These weapons featured a 10" barrel and were initially fitted with the same flash hiders as the parent rifles.  The excessive blast from the short barrel quickly made development of a specific "moderator" necessary and a 3.5" version was fitted to later models.  Later on, remaining Model 607s in service would also be found fitted with 4.5" moderators from XM177/GAU-5s described later.  Early versions of this weapon were also not fitted with the forward assist feature, like the M16 in service with the USAF.  Later versions and the later factory designated 607A had this feature, similar to the US Army's M16A1s.

In addition to the 607 Colt manufactured the Model 608, which was a special survival rifle prototype made specifically for the US Air Force, but never adopted.  Only 10 were believed to have been made.

The XM177 and the GAU-5/A.

With the initial success of the 607 idea, Colt refined the pattern and created 3 additional guns, the 609, 610, and 610B.  The most important features of these guns are the revised retracting stocks (similar in style to the stocks commonly found on M4 type rifles), originally cast out of aluminum, and short round handguards to help with the issues of the barrel becoming extremely hot during prolonged firing.  These weapons also had 10 in (254 mm) barrels and were originally fitted with the 3.5 in (89 mm) moderators designed for the 607.  A 4.5 in (114 mm) moderator was eventually created for these weapons.  The 609 had a forward assist for the bolt, but neither of the 610s did.  The Air Force maintained that it was an unnecessary addition that complicated the weapon, and both these guns and the M16 rifles purchased by them lacked the feature.  The US Army designated the 609 the XM177E1 and the 610 as the XM177.  The US Air Force designated the 610 the GAU-5/A, and it is believed received a small number of 610Bs for testing.  The B stands for burst, and these featured Colt s original four-position (Safe-Semi-Full-3RB) selector.

After fielding it, improvements were suggested, to which Colt answered with the revised Model 629 and Model 630, in which the barrel was lengthen to 11.5 inches (292 mm), which featured a barrel ring for launching rifle grenades.  As the use of such weapons in the US Army declined, the ring was retained for attaching the XM148 grenade launcher. The US Army designated the 629 the XM177E2, while the US Air Force purchased the Colt model 630 (no forward assist) and it was classified GAU-5A/A.  The US Air Force also received a number of "hand-me-down" Colt 629s from the US Army at some time, and it is believed that these weapons might have been designated GAU-5A/B, B/A, might have been incorporated into existing stocks of GAU-5A/As, cannibalised for parts, or simply left undesignated.
 

Colt eventually went on to improve the basic "Commando" design in the early 1970s. The barrel was lengthened to 14.5 inches (368 mm).  This barrel length allowed the usage of the M7 bayonet, and with the decision by the US administration in the late 1970s to ban the sale of sound suppression equipment abroad (the previous "XM" moderators had been classified by the BATF as sound suppressors, despite the general ridiculousness of calling them that), these weapons were fitted with the standard "birdcage" flash suppressor used on A1-type rifles.  This was done to allow exportation of these weapons under the Arms Export Act of 1976, which banned the export of sound suppressors.   Colt produced a number of carbine models, but the most prominent was the Colt 653. The US Army and US Navy procured some in small numbers for SOF units, but did not officially adopt it.  The 653 appeared in 1973, too late to see use by US forces in South East Asia.

Late 1970s and 1980s.

One of the largest end users of Colt 653s was Israel, who imported a large number just in time for the Yom Kippur War.  In the last decade or so, these weapons have been extensively modified, bringing them up to a pseudo-M4 standard.  These weapons have had their stock tubes modified to allow for six positions instead of the original 2 or 4, and have A2 style pistol grips, as well as, M4 profile barrels.  The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are currently phasing these out in favor true M4/A1 carbines.  Elisco Tools in the Philippines also acquired a license to produce the 653 locally, with Colt giving it the designation 653P.

The US Air Force has done a number of similar in-house upgrades and modifications to their old GAU-5 carbines, starting with simple rebarrels of 10 and 11.5 in (254 and 292 mm) guns with 14.5 in (368 mm) A1 profile barrels.  It has been said that these weapons were designated GAU-5/P but no official USAF source mentions this name.  It is more likely that these weapons either retained the designation of the parent weapons, went undesignated, or were designated GUU-5/P like later conversions.  Also, weapons rebarreled with M4 profile barrels or with their entire upper receivers replaced with M4A1 style M1913 rail "flat top" upper receivers.  Weapons in either of these configurations have been designated GUU-5/P.

These "A1" variants were used until the mid-1980s when the M16A2 and the new M855 FMJ and M856 Tracer rounds were adopted.  Colt began to develop a number of carbines with the same new rifling twist, 1:7 in (178 mm) as the M16A2, designed to fire these new rounds.  While the US purchased a number of Colt 720s (essentially M16A2 carbines) for testing, other countries provided the initial impetus, with the Canadian firm of Diemaco (recently purchased by Colt to provide a certain level of irony) even license producing the Colt Model 725 as the C8.  

Colt also updated the original ultra-short "Commando" and released the Model 733 and Model 735.  These guns again feature an 11.5 in (292 mm) barrel.  The difference between the 733 and the 735 is primarily in that the 733 is Safe-Semi-Full (S-1-F) and the 735 is Safe-Semi-Burst (S-1-3).  Early 733s also had A1 style rear sights.  Colt eventually released variants of both these guns with M1913 rail "Flat Top" upper receivers, as the 933 and the 935 respectively.  

The M16A2 Commando is similar in design and has many interoperable components with the M4 carbine and the M16 rifle; the Commando being the shortest and most compact of the three weapons.  The M4 for all intents and purposes is identical to A1 style carbines, with the exception of the A2-style rear sights and pistol grip, upgraded stock, upgraded handguards, and extended feed ramps in the breach, along with its distinct notched barrel profile, for mounting the M203/A1 grenade launcher.


2000s.
The Colt Commando concept was updated in the Close Quarters Battle Receiver upgrade for the M4 carbine, a new upper receiver with a 10.3 inch (260 mm) barrel and a Knight's Armament Company Rail Interface System handguard.  This was type-standardized as the Mk 18 Mod 0 and is in use by the United States Navy SEALs and possibly others.

Criticisms.
The Colt Commando shorter-barrel models are often criticized for its barrel length, which reduce muzzle velocity, and generates excessive muzzle flash.

Muzzle velocity drop can be seen from this table, adopted from testing by Bushmaster Firearms, Inc., an M16 and AR-15 rifle manufacturer.  The testing used a commercial round similar to the old M193 55-grain military round, and the military 62-grain SS109 NATO standard.


Adopted from: 

The normal trajectory standard, fired from 20-inch barrel M16 rifles, is as follows (adopted from 5.56 mm (.223) PARAMILITARY AMMUNITION in Rifle Magazine, January/February, 1988, John Schaefer).

Referenced at: 

One expert in wound ballistics, Col. Martin Fackler, M.D., has studied small arms wounding extensively.  While some of his findings are controversial among firearms experts, he has performed significant testing of ammunition, including tests into inert test media and into anesthetized pigs as live targets.

The damage done (and apparent incapacitation capability of) 5.56 mm rifle ammunition is significantly enhanced if the bullets fragment on impact.  Both M193 55-grain bullets and SS109 62-grain bullets fragment moderately at velocities over 2,500 feet per second, and extensively at velocities over 2,700 feet per second.  Even 10-inch barrels for Colt Commando rifles have in excess of 2,700 feet per second muzzle velocity, but rounds will drop below 2,700 ft/s within about 20 meters and below 2,500 ft/s within about 60 meters.

These studies were part of the body of research that led to the M4 carbine being produced with a 14.5-inch barrel length, which only loses about 50 meters worth of fragmenting range (about 125 meters) compared to the standard 20-inch rifle barrel (about 175 meters) when firing SS109 ammunition.

<doc id="2918420" title="George Jefferson" nonfiltered="751" processed="743" dbindex="1480756">


George Jefferson is a fictional character, played by actor Sherman Hemsley, who appeared on primetime American television from 1973 until 1985, in two CBS sitcoms: All in the Family (from 1973 until 1975) and its spinoff The Jeffersons (1975-1985).  

George Jefferson was an ambitious African American entrepreneur who started and managed a successful chain of seven dry cleaning stores in New York City called Jefferson Cleaners.  On All in the Family, Jefferson lived in a working-class neighborhood in the borough of Queens, next door to the Bunker family, with his wife Louise (Isabel Sanford) and son Lionel (Mike Evans).  Jefferson was referred to on All in the Family before he was first seen in 1973 (on the program, the reason given for his initial non-appearance was that he refused to set foot in his bigoted neighbor Archie Bunker's home; the actual reason was that Hemsley was appearing in the Broadway musical Purlie and would not commit to starring in All in the Family until his Broadway run ended).  When the spin-off series The Jeffersons began in January 1975, George and his family had moved to a luxury apartment in a high-rise building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.


Like his neighbor Archie Bunker, George Jefferson was very opinionated, prone to anger, and often misinformed.  He was in fact a sort of "black Archie Bunker," and held negative stereotypes of white people. Unlike Archie Bunker, George was a bit smarter as in a classic All in the  Family episode ("Archie's Contract") he tells Archie about how his brother-in-law  had fallen for an aluminum siding scam-although in one episode Louise Jefferson has to use George's dislike of Archie Bunker to manipulate George into going to the Bunker house. On occasion in The Jeffersons, George tries to prove he's smarter than everyone else-in one farcical episode George attempts to impress new clients (a mixed-race couple) by claiming he's a great friend of the Willis family-at the end Florence and Ralph the doorman have to pretend to be the Willis family-while the Willis pretend to be Florence and Ralph. George gets the clients but also has to foot the bill to Florence/Ralph/ & Tom and Helen Willis! Also like the Bunker character, George Jefferson softened as the years went on: by the time The Jeffersons left the air in 1985, the show rarely addressed topical issues such as racism or interracial marriage and focused more on the Jeffersons' family life, and on interactions with their maid Florence (played by Marla Gibbs) and with their neighbors.

Jefferson Cleaners.

George's ownership of the dry-cleaning business was established in the third episode of All in the Family. In that episode, titled "Oh, My Aching Back," Lionel explains that the family had been involved in a car accident and used the insurance money ($3,200) to start the business (Archie, who had also been involved in a non-injury car accident, fakes a back injury to get a settlement). Prior to George opening his store, he had worked as a janitor (and Louise as a housemaid); the family lived in a run-down section of Harlem prior to their move to Queens (which was often referred to during The Jeffersons).  In the 1980 Jeffersons episode "The First Store" George and Louise reminisce about the first store's opening, which coincided with the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. . The 1983 Jeffersons episode "Change of a Dollar" also detailed in flashback the 1968 opening of the first Jefferson Cleaners store.
 George had also served in the US navy as a cook aboard an aircraft carrier during the Korean War. A 1975 episode established that George's family had been Alabama sharecroppers; George was 45 years old ; George and Louise had been married 25 years; George had five cleaning stores-their first store was in Queens, New York. A 1977 episode established that George now had seven cleaning stores and had never completed high school and had been in business ten years.

Although not mentioned on The Jeffersons, it was shown that George was also the uncle of Chicago emergency room nurse Julie Williams on the short-lived comedy, E/R.  He in fact, made a visit to Julie, when he was shopping for a scarf that Louise liked.

George's chief rival in the dry cleaning business was Gil Cunningham, with whom George had a considerably hostile relationship. However it was revealed later in the series after Mr. Cunningham had died that he had never wanted to be enemies with George and that his ruthless wife, played by actress Susan Ruttan had been the one who had wanted to ruin him all those years. In his will he had left a bowling trophy he had won in a tournament against Jefferson Cleaners to George with a letter inside that said "she put the 'cunning' in Cunningham" and warned him not to trust her.

George, along with Louise and their maid Florence made an appearance on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, purchasing the Banks' mansion with Louise in the series finale.

<doc id="6821347" title="Pandeism" nonfiltered="753" processed="745" dbindex="1480758">
Pandeism is occasionally used as a synonym for pantheism or for omnitheism; this article discusses other uses of the term.;



Pandeism is a term that has been used at various times to describe religious beliefs. It is now particularly addressed to syncretist concepts incorporating or mixing elements of pantheism (that God is identical to the universe) and deism (that the creator-god who designed the universe no longer exists in a status where he can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly "the belief that God precedes the universe and is the universe's creator,  that the universe is currently the entirety of God", with some adding the contention that "the universe will one day coalesce back into a single being, God".

This use has been inconsistent over time - modern usage has described (or contrasted) the nature of God as described by broader philosophical systems, but the term has also occasionally been misused to refer dismissively to this, and also to simultaneous belief in all religions, or some elements thereof. Some 19th century figures (particularly religionist Godfrey Higgins, later echoed by occult figure John Ballou Newbrough) used the term to describe the beliefs that they attributed to a particular cult or sect, the worshipers of a group of gods called Pans. For this use, see Pandeism (Godfrey Higgins).

A pantheistic form of deism.

Pandeism falls within the traditional hierarchy of philosophies addressing the nature of God. This use of the term is a blend of the Greek root     ( 'pan' ), meaning 'all', and the Latin deus meaning God. Pan, is used this way in pantheism and panentheism, and pandeism is a variation of the term "pantheism". Pantheism, in turn, came from the term "pantheist" purportedly first used by Irish writer John Toland in his 1705 work, Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist. This is fused to the word deism, itself originally derived from the Latin root deus. Centuries ago, theism and deism had been interchangeable, both referring to belief in God, but deism was adopted by the deist movement, which used it to refer to a God who was not known by revelation, but could only be found by rational thought. 

Development.
Ancient philosophy and mythology.

Religious studies professor, F. E. Peters traced the idea to the philosophy of the Milesians, who had also pioneered knowledge of pantheism, in his 1967 Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon: 
What appeared here, at the center of the Pythagorean tradition in philosophy, is another view of psyche that seems to owe little or nothing to the pan-vitalism or pan-deism (see ) that is the legacy of the Milesians. ;

Many ancient mythologies suggested that the world was created from the physical substance of a dead deity or a being of similar power.  In Sumerian mythology, the young god Marduk slew Tiamat and created the known world from her body. Similarly, Norse mythology posited that Odin and his brothers, Vé and Vili defeated a frost giant, Ymir and then created the world from his.  Later Chinese mythology recounts the creation of elements of the physical world (mountains, rivers, the sun and moon, etc.) from the body of a creator called Pan Gu. Because these myths were developed by people unaware of the true scope of the universe, they can fairly be said to describe the creation of the "entire world" from the body of one being. However, such stories generally have not gone so far as to identify the designer of the world as being one with the being whose body provided the material.

Origin of modern pandeism.

The ideas that underscore modern pandeism have many authors, but a few are of note. In the 17th Century, Baruch Spinoza was perhaps the earliest to use deistic reason to arrive at the conception of a pantheistic God. Spinoza's God was deistic in the sense that it could only be proved by appeal to reason, but it was also one with the Universe. As one critic states:

The labeling of Spinoza's philosophy as "pantheism" by the Church was meant more as an invective and indictment than a true analysis of his writings. It was really a variant of Deism -- a "pandeism," if I may. Theism, however, posits something very different. Theism believes that nature was not God, but created BY God. That God is a completely independent sentient and cognitive Being, and that God interacts with his "children" on a personal level (e.g., The Bible).;

Spinoza's pantheistic focus on the Universe as it already existed did not address the possible creation of the Universe from the substance of God, for Spinoza rejected the very possibility of changes in the form of matter required as a premise for such a belief. 

18th Century British philosopher Thomas Paine also approached this territory in his great philosophical treatise, The Age of Reason, although Paine was concentrated on the deistic aspects of his inquiry. It was Dutch naturalist Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn who first specifically detailed a religious philosophy incorporating deism and pantheism, in his four volume treatise, Java, seine Gestalt, Pflanzendecke, und sein innerer Bau (Images of Light and Shadow from Java's interior) released anonymously between 1850 and 1854. Junghuhn's book was banned for a time in Austria and parts of Germany as an attack on Christianity. In 1884, theologian Sabine Baring-Gould contended that Christianity itself demanded that the seemingly irreconcilable elements of pantheism and deism must be combined:

This world is either the idea or it is the workmanship of God. If we say that it is the idea,--then we are Pantheists, if we say that it is the work, then we are Deists... But how, it may be asked, can two such opposite theories as Pantheism and Deism be reconciled,--they mutually exclude one another? I may not be able to explain how they are conciliable, but I boldly affirm that each is simultaneously true, and that each must be true, for each is an inexorably logical conclusion, and each is a positive conclusion, and all positive conclusions must be true if Christ be the Ideal and the focus of all truths.

In the 19th Century, poet Alfred Tennyson revealed that his "religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism", integrating deism with the pantheism of Spinoza, and Spinoza's predecessor, Giordano Bruno.

Developments from the 1960s to today.

Understanding of pandeism was much advanced in the 1960s by Charles Hartshorne, considered by many to be a theological Einstein. Hartshorne identified pandeism as one of his many models of the possible nature of God, acknowledging that a God capable of change (as Hartshorne insisted God must be) is consistent with pandeism. Harteshorne preferred pandeism to pantheism, explaining that "it is not really the theos that is described". However, he specifically rejected pandeism early on in favor of a God whose characteristics included "absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others" or "AR", writing that this theory "is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism." Hartshorne accepted the label of panentheism for his beliefs, declaring that "panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations".

In 2001, Scott Adams published God's Debris: A Thought Experiment, in which Adams set down his own variation of pandeism. Adams surmised that an omnipotent God annihilated himself in the Big Bang, because God would already know everything possible except his own lack of existence, and would have to end that existence in order to complete his knowledge. Adams asks about God, "would his omnipotence include knowing what happens after he loses his omnipotence, or would his knowledge of the future end at that point?"  He proceeds from this question to the following analysis:

A God who knew the answer to that question would indeed know everything and have everything. For that reason he would be unmotivated to do anything or create anything. There would be no purpose to act in any way whatsoever. But a God who had one nagging question what happens if I cease to exist? might be motivated to find the answer in order to complete his knowledge. ... The fact that we exist is proof that God is motivated to act in some way. And since only the challenge of self-destruction could interest an omnipotent God, it stands to reason that we... are God's debris.;

Adams' God exists now as a combination of the smallest units of energy of which the universe is made (many levels smaller than quarks), which Adams called "God Dust", and the law of probability, or "God's debris", hence the title. An unconventional twist introduced by Adams proposes that God is in the process of being restored not through some process such as the Big Crunch, but because humankind itself is becoming God.

Adams is hardly the first author to incorporate pandeistic doctrines into fiction. Dan Schneider, in his review of Stranger in a Strange Land, a 1967 novel, by Robert A. Heinlein, so identifies a character who appears to other characters as identifying humanity as God:

Jubal... is a devout and fierce individualist in a world filled with cults and bureaucracies, and by novel's end it is he, not Jill nor Mike, that is still a stranger, still tilting against the windmills. He honestly believes in his own free will, which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, 'Thou art God!' Mike, by contrast, readily abandons his Martian beliefs for human ones, even as he claims to merely find a congress between them.;
The idea of humankind becoming God is also fundamental to the 1950s Isaac Asimov short story, "The Last Question", in which human and computer knowledge is merged before the heat death of the universe. The computer, which continued to exist in hyperspace, had been asked how to stop entropy. It finally figured out the answer and implemented it, saying "Let there be light!" This is not a necessary element of pandeism, but correlates with it well.

Compatibility with scientific and philosophical proofs.

Arguments for the existence of God support a pandeistic universe. Both the cosmological argument (that there must be a first cause) and the teleological argument (that the existence of complex patterns in the universe show intentional design) point to a pandeistic universe as readily as one with an activist God. Pandeism is compatible with evolutionary creationism in that it posits the creation of the universe by intelligent design.  Pandeism differs from theistic creation theories by suggesting that the designer has ceased to have an independent existence. The Big Bang may be seen as the event signifying the transformation of God into the universe.

Scientific plausibility for this theory was introduced to pandeism through a paper written by Italian astrophysicist Paola Zizzi. Notable for her work in the field of Loop quantum gravity theory that regards the early universe as a kind of quantum computer, Zizzi proposed that the universe could have achieved the threshold of computational complexity sufficient for the emergence of consciousness during the period of cosmic inflation, in a paper entitled "Emergent Consciousness: From the Early Universe to Our Mind" , which has become known as the "Big Wow" theory. Zizzi states that the universe reached a level of quantum computational complexity, during the period of cosmic inflation, to undergo Orchestrated Objective Reduction, or Orch-OR, allowing the emergence of consciousness.  Zizzi s paper is fundamentally a theory of Loop quantum gravity which derives some of its power from the Holographic Principle.  It suggests that the universe s conscious moment, or  occasion of experience  came at the end of the inflationary period in physical cosmology, and was the event that allowed the universe s quantum state vector to reduce, thus selecting the conditions for our specific universe, out of a superposed multitude of possibilities. This, too, has been reflected in fiction, in the Star Trek novel, "Corona" which featured sentient proto-stars seeking to induce a new Big Bang.

The pandeistic universe is just as the universe described in naturalistic pantheism, with the distinction that the belief necessarily encompasses a sentient God that existed before the formation of the universe. Panentheism also suggests a universe designed by a sentient deity, and composed of matter derived from that deity.  The belief systems part on the point that panentheism asserts that God is greater than the universe, and therefore continues a separate existence alongside it, while pandeism asserts that everything that was God became incorporated into the universe.

Because "Pandeists believe all consciousness, in all life, to be fragments of God's awareness" Such a God may not consciously interact with the material universe, but might still exerts a latent influence over the development of the physical universe, and the evolution of things within it. Because man is part of the material universe, and therefore composed of remnants of God, it could then be possible for God's energy to be tapped by an individual. 

As with man's ability to release the power of the atom in an atomic bomb or nuclear reactor, every human mind could conceivably access and release some portion of the power or the knowledge of God, perhaps by simply realizing their connection with the universe through meditation. If this is valid, religious figures such as Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, the Buddha, and others may have been able to perform those miracles attributed to them by tapping into this infinite source of energy.

Comparison to eastern philosophy.
The ideas described by pandeism in the West have resonance with certian Eastern philosophies, particularly with some expressions of Hinduism. Warren Sharpe wrote:

To the Hindu, for example, God didn't create the universe, but God became the universe. Then he forgot that he became the universe. Why would God do this? Basically, for entertainment. You create a universe, and that in itself is very exciting.  But then what? Should you sit back and watch this universe of yours having all the fun? No, you should have all the fun yourself. To accomplish this, God transformed into the whole universe. God is the Universe, and everything in it. But the universe doesn't know that because that would ruin the suspense. The universe is God's great drama, and God is the stage, the actors, and the audience all at once. The title of this epic drama is "The Great Unknown Outcome." Throw in potent elements like passion, love, hate, good, evil, free will; and who knows what will happen? No one knows, and that is what keeps the universe interesting. But everyone will have a good time. And there is never really any danger, because everyone is really God, and God is really just playing around.;

History of use of the term.

The earliest known usage of a variation of "Pandeism" to identify a pantheistic deism was in an 1859 German work, Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft by philosophers and frequent collaborators Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal. Discussing religious philosophy, they wrote, "Man stelle es also den Denkern frei, ob sie Theisten, Pan-theisten, Atheisten, Deisten (und warum nicht auch Pandeisten?)", translated as "Man leaves it to the philosophers, whether they are Theists, Pan-theists, Atheists, Deists (and why not also Pandeists?)". 

Godfrey Higgins used the term "Pandeism" as early as 1833 to describe his theorized cult of Pandu and the Pandavas. However, the first use in English to describe a synthesis of pantheism and deism appears to be by William Harbutt Dawson, in his 1904 biographical work, Matthew Arnold and His Relation to the Thought of Our Time. Dawson used the term "Pan-Deism" as a comparative reference point, writing:

... whatever the deity which satisfied Arnold's personal experience may have been, the religion which he gives us in Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible is neither Deism nor bare Pan-Deism, but a diluted Positivism. As an ethical system it is in theory admirable, but its positive value is in the highest degree questionable. Pascal's judgment upon the God who emerged from the philosophical investigations of René Descartes was that He was a God who was unnecessary.;

The term appears to have been little used between the 1960s and the 1990s. In 1997, Pastor Bob Burridge of the Genevan Institute for Reformed Studies wrote an essay titled God Is Not the Author of Sin, identifying pandeism as a deistic refinement or subset of pantheism:

All the actions of created intelligences are not merely the actions of God. He has created a universe of beings which are said to act freely and responsibly as the proximate causes of their own moral actions. When individuals do evil things it is not God the Creator and Preserver acting. If God was the proximate cause of every act it would make all events to be "God in motion". That is nothing less than pantheism, or more exactly, pandeism. ;
Burridge disagrees that such is the case, decrying that "The Creator is distinct from his creation. The reality of secondary causes is what separates Christian theism from pandeism."
Burridge concludes by challenging his reader to determine why "calling God the author of sin demand a pandeistic understanding of the universe effectively removing the reality of sin and moral law."

Similarly, a 1995 news article quotes this use of the term by Jim Garvin a Vietnam vet who became a Trappist monk in the Holy Cross Abbey of Berryville, Virginia, and went on to lead the economic development of Phoenix, Arizona. Garvin described his spiritual position as "'pandeism' or 'pan-en-deism,' something very close to the Native American concept of the all- pervading Great Spirit..."

Usage as a restatement of another concept.

Some uses to which the term has been put are etymologically disjunctive, as they ascribe a meaning to the term that does not reflect the roots of what is an obvious portmanteau within a well defined family of similar terms. 
Conversely, the term may describe a deistic pantheism, in which a God that has always been pantheistic has ceased a previously active interection with the universe. The term has been used in some instances as a restatement of pantheism (the concept that God and the universe are one) or panendeism (the concept that God both is the universe, and transcends the universe). Others have specified that it is a concept distinct from pantheism, and have used it instead to describe a universe which combines elements of pantheism (for example, that God and the universe are one) and deism (for example, that a creator God created a self-regulating universe, but subsequently ceased to actively intervene in its operations). 

Examples.

Reverend Natalia Kita, classifies her beliefs as "transcendental pandeism," a phrase to which she assigns the following meaning:

God not only is, always was, and always will be the universe, but that the Universe is contained within God, and God transcends that which we know as the Universe. I also believe that all living beings contain the knowledge/wisdom of God/the Universe within them, if only they open their minds to it. I view God not so much as a being, but as a force of pure spirit and energy, containing all the knowledge/wisdom there is, and sharing it with all.
This use of the term appears to be consonant with panentheism, but with some minor variations with respect to the relationship between God and the individual.

This assertion is echoed by "Cristorly" (the pseudonym of Dominican poet and theologian) Orlando Alcántara, who also characterizes the pantheistic God as transcendent, while the pandeistic God is merely continuous with Creation:
God is inmanent, trascendent and holistic. That is Pantheism, not Pandeism. Pantheism is right, because we are speaking about a personal, individual, trascendent God. Pandeism (like Spinoza's) is not right, due to the fact that is not a trascendent God, a God beyond Creation. ;
Cristorly developed a "Theognosis" of Omnientheism, which integrates six concepts - theism, deism, panentheism, panendeism, pandeism, and pantheism - into a coherent corpus or canon. Cristorly describes his definitions as "discretional," meaning that each can only be understood in the context of all the rest. Cristorly asserts:

The terms Theism, Pantheism, and Panentheism have their root in Greek, which is a Biblical language, and therefore it is correct. In a discretionary way we assume that these terms present the idea of a personal, individual God. However, the terms Deism, Pandeism, and Panendeism have their root in Latin, which is not a Biblical language, and therefore it is not correct. These terms present the idea of God like synonymous of Energy or Cosmic Force, because God is not personal here, He is not individual.

Within this grouping, the meanings of the terms hinge on their categorization of the "transcendence, immanence, and holism of God". With respect to pandeism, he notes, "we see that Energy or Cosmic Force in Pandeism is immanent and holistic, but it is not transcendent." 

The following excerpt from a discussion of a painting by Spanish artist Orlando Cordero illustrates the same conceptual distinction between pantheism and pandeism. The author used the words "pandeísta" and "pandeísmo" in the Spanish version, which were translated by the author into "pandeist" and "pandeism", respectively. The comparison suggests that pandeism is a system with a cold, impersonal God, while pantheism presents a warm and experiential God:

His vision is pandeist, and it had to be pantheist. In order to get a pantheist painting, it is necessary to have Christ as pennant, footpath, and lighthouse. Pandeism is impersonal like in the present canvas, in which man, nature and word integrate themselves; whereas pantheism is a personal Christ-like experience of every day. Here there is signal-like materiality for the making of other paintings. ;

Pandeism as omnitheism.

A different use of the term is typified in the usage ascribed by J. Sidlow Baxter, who wrote in his 1991 master work, The Most Critical Issue:

If the Bible is only human lore, and not divine truth, then we have no real answer to those who say, "Let's pick the best out of all religions and blend it all into Pan-Deism - one world religion with one god made out of many".;

This use of the word is synonymous with omnitheism, which supposes a kernal of truth in all religions, rather than all being simultaneously true in their entirety. In a variation on this theme, the Vatican has been accused of having a pandeism conspiracy with respect to other religions:

The church of Rome uses the term "pandeism", to describe her current program of bringing under her wing the non-Christian religions of the world. In this, Rome will finally succeed, because the prediction says, "all the world wondered after the beast".  (Revelation 13:3);

Gilbert Randoll Coate (8 October 1909   2 December 2005) was a British diplomat, maze designer and "labyrinthologist".

Early life.
The son of Gilbert Randoll Coate, an expatriate businessman, Coate was born in Lausanne, Switzerland. After studying at the Collège de Lausanne he won a scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford, reading French and German. During the Second World War he served with military intelligence, using his language abilities to interrogate prisoners of war in the "London Cage". He also took part in Operation Archery, a commando raid on port Vaagso, Norway and helped support Greek resistance fighters in liberating Kalamata.

Diplomatic career.
After the war, Coate joined the UK Foreign Office with diplomatic postings to Salonika, Oslo, Leopoldville, Rome, The Hague, Buenos Aires, Stockholm and finally Brussels at which point he took early retirement in 1967. 

Maze designer.
Having had a long-standing interest in art and history, Coate took to designing mazes and completed over 50 new mazes in Britain and around the world. Coate's maze designs are particularly noted for their symbolism. Although it is rarely possible to see a large maze in plan view, Coate's designs would often incorporate hidden shapes and references of significance to the clients who had commissioned the maze.

Coate's first maze commission, The Imprint of Man, was completed in 1975 for a private garden in Gloucestershire. The overall outline was of a giant footprint 57 m long by 29 m wide   a size calculated to match the size of a 300-m tall person, matching the height of the Eiffel Tower. The hedge maze, constructed from 3,000 yew bushes, ended up too large for its intended field. Coate's solution was to extend the maze into the adjacent river, creating an artificial island for the second toe. The intricate design incorporated 132 symbols, including numbers, signs of the zodiac and local wild animals.

Some of his other notable mazes include;
Pyramid (1977)   yew hedge maze in the form of a pyramid at the Château de Beloeil, Belgium, in which the height of the hedges increases to reach 6 m at the centre;
Creation (1979)   yew hedge maze at Värmlands Säby, Sweden, for the Baroness of Falkenberg, with overlapping layers of symbolism. Seen one way, the egg-shaped outline represents the Garden of Eden incorporating figures for Adam, Eve, the Serpent and the apple. Seen another way, the hedge outlines form the shape of the horned Minotaur of the original Minoan labyrinth.

Minotaur Designs.
In 1979, Coate was introduced to Adrian Fisher, another enthusiastic maze designer. Shortly afterwards Coate and Fisher formed the maze design company Minotaur Designs and designed 15 mazes together between 1979 and 1989, (some with the landscape architect Graham Burgess in 1983 and 1984). These included:
Archbishop's Maze (1980)   a brick path and turf maze at Greys Court, England, incorporating  Christian symbolism to commemorate the maze metaphor that Robert Runcie mentioned in his enthronement address on becoming Archbishop of Canterbury;
Beatles Maze (1984)   brick path and water-channel maze at the first National Garden Festival, Liverpool, England, featuring an 18-ton, 15.5-m long sculpture of a yellow submarine at its centre, and with an outline in the shape of an apple, in reference to The Beatles' Apple Corps record label;
Bath Festival Maze (1984)   a stone path in Beazer Gardens near the Pulteney Bridge, Bath, England, celebrating the city of Bath with motifs based on Georgian fanlights, arches from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's railway and a Roman-inspired mosaic circle at its centre;
Marlborough Maze (1988)   a yew hedge maze at Blenheim Palace for the Duke of Marlborough and based on a stone carving by Grinling Gibbons representing the "Panoply of Victory", with a symbolism based on cannons, banners and trumpets.

Other mazes.
Sun Maze and Lunar Labyrinth (1996)   Longleat, near Bath, England, for the Marquess of Bath (who has another four mazes in the grounds of the house);
Millennium Maze   Borghese gardens, Rome, Italy;
Lappa Valley Railway Maze   yew hedge Cornwall, England, shaped like an early steam locomotive;
El laberinto de Borges (Borges Memorial Maze)   San Rafael, Mendoza, Argentina, box hedge maze, measuring 95 m by 65 m, in memory of the writer Jorge Luis Borges (a personal friend of Coate's), inspired by his short story El Jardin de Senderos que se Bifurcan (The Garden of Forking Paths). Shaped like an open book, the design incorporates, in Braille, a famous quotation from the blind writer, that a book and a labyrinth are "one and the same".

Family life.
In 1955, Coate married the painter, Pamela Dugdale Moore, with whom he raised two daughters. He was also made a Chevalier of the Ordre de Léopold in 1965 and appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1966.

He died in Le Rouret, near Grasse, France on the 2 December 2005, aged 96.

<doc id="147515" title="Busch Series" nonfiltered="756" processed="748" dbindex="1480761">

The NASCAR Busch Series is a stock car racing series owned and operated by NASCAR. It is NASCAR's second division (often compared to Triple-A baseball), and is a proving ground for drivers who wish to step up to the organization's top level, the Nextel Cup.  Each Busch Series race is usually held in the same venue as, and a day prior to, the Nextel Cup race scheduled for that weekend, encouraging fans to attend both events. 

In December, 2006, NASCAR officials confirmed that Anheuser-Busch, parent company for Busch Beer, will not renew its sponsorship of NASCAR's No. 2 series after the end of the 2007 season. Rumored new sponsors for the series include Wal-Mart, Samsung and Subway. 

History.
The series emerged from NASCAR's old Sportsman division, which was formed in 1950 as NASCAR's short track race division. It was NASCAR's third series. The sportsman cars were not current model cars, and could be modified more (but not as much as Modified series cars).  It became the Late Model Sportsman series in 1968, and soon featured races on larger tracks, such as Daytona International Speedway. Drivers used obsolete Grand National (now NEXTEL Cup) cars on larger tracks. Grand National cars were required to be less than three years old. Short track cars with relatively small 300 cubic inch V-8 motors were used. Drivers used smaller current year models featuring V6 motors. The cars looked like smaller versions of Cup cars. 

The modern-day Busch Series was formed in 1982, when Anheuser-Busch sponsored a newly reformed late-model sportsman series with its Budweiser brand.  The series switched sponsorship to Busch in 1984. It was renamed in 1986 to the Busch Grand National Series. The V6 based cars left the series by the mid 1990s. The cars gradually changed to cars just like Cup cars. Grand National was dropped from the series' title in 2003. Following the 2007 season, Anhauser-Busch, makers of the Busch brand of beer, has said they will not renew their contract with NASCAR, preferring to stay onboard with their Budweiser brand sponsorship of the Pole Award in NEXTEL Cup.  The series will have a new sponsor in 2008.

The Busch Series Today.
The cars used today in the Busch Series are slightly different versions of their Nextel Cup counterparts, the main differences being a slightly shorter wheelbase (105" instead of 110") and a larger spoiler (57" wide x 5.75" high instead of 55" x 4.5"). In the past, Busch Series competitors could use makes of cars not used in the Cup series, as well as V-6 engines instead of Cup's V-8s, but the cars used in the series now are very similar.

On March 6, 2005, the Busch Series held its first race outside the United States, the Telcel-Motorola 200. The race was held in Mexico City, Mexico at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, a track that had previously held Formula One and Champ Car races in the past, and was won by Martin Truex Jr..

Beginning in 2007, ABC, and ESPN2 will be the exclusive carrier of all Busch Series races,  currently shown on FOX, FX, TNT and NBC. Some sponsors have cricitised the new television deal, noting a maximum of four races will appear on broadcast network television, and most likely none in prime-time;  in recent years, as many as nine races in the Busch Series have aired on network television, with two 2005 races ending up in prime-time television.

Busch Series cars used fuel that contained lead. NASCAR conducted a three-race test of unleaded fuel in this series that began with the July 29, 2006 race at Gateway International Raceway. The fuel, Sunoco GT 260 Unleaded, will be come mandatory in all series starting with the second weekend of the 2007 series, as Daytona will be the last race weekend with leaded fuel.  Once the Car of Tomorrow is implemented in the Nextel Cup series, NASCAR will begin work on changing the cars run in the Busch Series. NASCAR has been approached by manufacturers about using differently shaped and named car models as the basis for the cars in the Busch Series when this change is made. NASCAR has been receptive to the idea.

Trivia.

 Mark Martin has the most NASCAR Busch Series wins in history with 47 victories, with the most recent being at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on March 12, 2005, driving the #9 Pennzoil Ford for Roush Racing.

 The 2006 season started the 25th season of the NASCAR Busch Series. The Series was the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Series before it was the Busch Grand National Series in 1982.

 Dale Earnhardt won the first Busch Series race on February 13, 1982 at Daytona International Speedway in the Goody's 300.

Buschwhackers.

Since the early days of the Busch Series, many Cup drivers have used their days off to drive in the Busch Series. This can be for any number of reasons, most prominent or often claimed is to gain more "seat time", or to familiarize themselves with the track. Examples of this would be the first ever winner of a Busch Series race, Dale Earnhardt, and the winner of the most races in Busch Series history, Mark Martin. In recent years, this practice has been termed "Buschwhacking" by those that criticize the practice, claiming that Cup drivers racing in the Busch Series takes away opportunities from the Busch Series regulars, drivers that are usually younger and less experienced. Proponents of this practice, however, claim that without the Cup "superstars" and the large amount of fan interest they attract, the series would cease to exist.

In 2007, the Nextel Cup Series will begin racing with a Car of Tomorrow. Although it is likely that many Cup drivers will still race in the Busch Series, their role may be largely diminished. The Busch Series will not run the COT (for now) and thus would ruin the advantages of running the races for the Cup drivers.

<doc id="1749483" title="Empoli" nonfiltered="758" processed="750" dbindex="1480763">
For the painter, see Jacopo da Empoli.

Empoli is a town in Tuscany, Italy, about 30 km southwest of Florence. It is situated 30 m above sea-level, to the south of the Arno. It lies in a plain formed by the Arno River. The plain has been usable for agriculture since Roman times.  The commune's territory becomes a hilly one as it departs from the river. Empoli is on the main railway line from Florence to Pisa, and is the point of divergence of a line to Siena.

Empoli has an enduring tradition as an agricultural centre. It has given its name to a local variety of artichoke.

History.

Archaeological finds have revealed that Empoli was already settled in the early Roman Empire times, and continued to exist until 4th century AD. The river acted as a communication way for the trade of agricultural products, together with the local amphorae. In the Tabula Peutingeriana of the 4th century Empoli is called In Portu ("in the port") as a river port on the Via Quinctia, which led from Fiesole and Florence to Pisa. Empoli was also on the Via Salaiola, connecting to Volterra's salt mills.

Since the 8th century Empoli consolidated as a town around the castle, known as Emporium or Empolis. In 1119 it was absorbed into the Guidi counts possessions. In 1182 it went under Florentine rule. In 1260, after the Battle of Montaperti, Empoli was the seat of a famous council in which Farinata degli Uberti opposed the destruction of Florence.

Later Empoli became an important fortress, and was therefore repeatedly sacked. In 1530 its fall marked the end of the independence of the Florentine Republic.

Main sights.

The Piazza Farinata degli Uberti, also known as Piazza dei Leoni ("Lions Square"), is marked in its centre by a faountain by Luigi Pampaloni (1827). Here lies the Collegiata di Sant'Andrea, the main city's monument. The church probably existed as early as the 5th century AD, and is mentioned in papal bull of 1059. It was rebuilt in the 11th century by the pievano Rolando. At the mid of the following century a Romanesque arcaded façade was added: it was decorated with bi-chrome marble stones, in a style inspired by the basilica of San Miniato in Florence. The green stones were from Prato, the white ones are from Carrara: today the lower part of the original decoration remains. In 1735 the architect Ferdinando Ruggeri extensively modified the façade and the interior structure, including the ceiling. It houses noteworthy artworks including paintings by Francesco Botticini, a terracotta by Luca della Robbia, an altarpiece (1785) by Zanobi del Rosso and a triptych by Lorenzo di Bicci portraying the Madonna in Throne with Saints.
The Palazzo Ghibellino is the former palace of the Guidi counts. It was probably erected in the 11th century. In 1260 it was the seat of the Ghibelline parliament where the fate of the Florence's Guelphs was decided. In the 16th century the palace was restored, leaving little of the original structure, though.
The Palazzo Pretorio was the Town Hall in the Middle Ages. Currently it houses several activities, including an auditorium.

In the frazione (hamlet) of Pontorme is the house of the painter Pontormo.

<doc id="585520" title="Terran Confederation" nonfiltered="759" processed="751" dbindex="1480764">


The Terran Confederation is the primary human government in the Wing Commander science fiction series. 

The Terran Confederation is an alliance of systems and regional governments which provide unified protection and economic growth. The Confederation was formed on August 23rd, 2416 with the signing of the Articles of Confederation, the first unified Earth government since the grisly disintegration of the World Economic Consortium in the early 25th century. 

Government and Politics.

The Terran Confederation is a representative democracy organized on the federal system (making its name something of a misnomer as a confederation is a different type of government than a federation; in the original pitch document the Confederation was referred to as the Terran Empire). It consists of approximately seven hundred systems spread over four thousand light years as of 2681. The Confederation is divided into eight sectors (Avalon, Gemini, Hawking, Sol, Vega, Argent, Epsilon and Enigma). Each of these is further subdivided into four quadrants. 

The Confederation government is headed by an elected President. In an event where the President is infirm, resigns, or is otherwise incapable of fulfilling the duties of the office, he/she is replaced by the Vice President. The most recent example of this was in 2668, when President Harold Rodham resigned following the uproar over the Kilrathi False Armistice.

The chief legislative body is the Confederation Senate. The Senate is based in Washington, D.C on Earth, across the mall from the old Congress building of the United States.

Military.

The Terran Confederation Military (known collectively, and somewhat informally, as Confed) is divided into four branches: the Army, Marines, Navy, and Space Forces. Each branch has a representative on the Confederation military's governing council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, based on Earth. Its commander-in-chief is the President.

Rank Structure.

There are two basic rank systems in use within the military of the Terran Confederation. One is used by the Army, Marines and Space Forces, the other by the Navy. Transfers between the two services are possible.

The Dutch Fork is a region of South Carolina located in Lexington, Newberry, and Richland Counties between the Saluda River and the Broad River where they  together, forming the Congaree River.  The area is named after the original Dutch settlers of the area, but like the Pennsylvania Dutch, Dutch here is used in its older more inclusive sense that includes Germans. Initial settlement of the area was largely between 1730 and 1766 when the South Carolina government offered incentives for foreign Protestants to settle what was then the backcountry.

The Dutch Fork today.
Unlike the Pennsylvania Dutch country, the use of a German dialect has not survived.  The Dutch heritage is preserved mainly in place and family names and the presence of a number of Lutheran churches, some dating back to the 18th century.  Newberry is the only county in South Carolina with over 10% of its population being Lutheran.  Dutch Fork High School, Dutch Fork Middle School, and Dutch Fork Elementary School are three of the nineteen schools of Lexington & Richland County School District Five which covers the entirety of the Lexington and Richland County portion of the Dutch Fork.  The Dutch Square Center shopping mall also alludes to the area in its name.  The Dutch Fork cultivar of the China Rose (Rosa chinensis) was developed in the area.  Since 2005, a monthly newspaper, The Dutch Fork Chronicle, has been published in the area.

Fort Fraser is a community of about 1000 people, situated  near the base of Mount Fraser, close to both Fraser Lake and the Nechako River. It can be found near the geographical centre of British Columbia, Canada, 44 km west of Vanderhoof on The Yellowhead Highway.  Originally established in 1806 as a North West Company fur trading post by the explorer Simon Fraser, it is one of present-day British Columbia's oldest permanent European-founded settlements.  The area around the community is also recorded as the site of the first land in British Columbia cultivated by non-First Nations people.

The original site of the fort is 4km to the west, in Beaumont Provincial Park. In 1911, the fort was relocated to nearby Nadleh Village, and later closed in 1915.  The present community is located at the site of the last spike of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, driven on April 7, 1914.  Today, Fort Fraser is 
an active community sustained by both forestry and tourism.

The Fort Fraser Fall Fair is one of the oldest agricultural fairs in BC. The event has run annually since 1928, on the Labour Day weekend in September.

<doc id="6993686" title="Tofa language" nonfiltered="766" processed="758" dbindex="1480771">


Tofa, also known as Tofalar or Karagas, is one of the Turkic languages.  It is a moribund language spoken in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast.

Tofa is most closely related to the Tuvan language and forms a dialect continuum with it, Tuha, and Tsengel Tuvan, which may be dialects of either Tuvan or Tofa.  Tofa shares a number of innovations with these languages, including the change *d>z (as in *adaq > azak "foot") and the development of low tones on historically short vowels (as in *et > èt "meat, flesh").

Writing System.
Tofa, although not widely written, employs a modified version of the Cyrillic alphabet:



The additional letters in Tofa are [[ |  ]] (), [[ |  ]] (), Ii (), [[ |  ]] (), [[ |  ]] (), [[ |  ]] (), [[ |  ]] (), [[ |  ]] (), and [[ |]] ().  Additionally, the letter    is sometimes used after a vowel to mark low tone, as in     "meat".

Alder is a fictional character in the Pendragon series. He is  the traveler from the territory Denduron. He appears in The Merchant of Death, and The Rivers of Zadaa. He is described as being over six feet tall, and not handsome (Bobby claims that everything about him "seemed too big".). He is clumsy, but also a great warrior with heightened senses and excellent skill at throwing knives, which is seen when he pins a snake to a wall in an underground cavern.

Arsaces II of Parthia ruled c. 211 191 BC. He is called Artabanus by early scholars but modern historians prefer "Arsaces".

He succeeded his father Arsaces I in about 211 BC. In 209 BC Antiochus III of the Seleucid kingdom invaded Parthia, occupied the capital Hecatompylos, pushed forward to Tagae near Damghan, defeated Arsaces II at Mount Labus, and entered Hyrcania where he occupied Tambrax. Syrinx was then taken by siege.

Arsaces II apparently successfully sued for peace and Antiochus moved on to fight another rebel in Bactria. Arsaces was succeeded by his cousin Phriapatius in 191 BC.

<doc id="6190497" title="Spiritist doctrine" nonfiltered="771" processed="763" dbindex="1480776">


This article discusses in detail the doctrine of Spiritism as presented in the works of Allan Kardec, especially in The Spirits Book and The Gospel According to Spiritism.

The teachings of Jesus.

Spiritism believes Jesus was on Earth as a special envoy from God. He was the most-elevated spirit to incarnate on Earth until his time (and possibly even to the present). His preaching was intended to break the traditional and formulaic mindset of the human race, preparing the ground for the evolution of the planet to a higher state. In light of these theses, Spiritism explains the teachings of Christ as veiled hints of what would later be revealed to the world as Spiritism.

For instance, when Jesus said "Think not that I am come to destroy the law", it must be understood that Christ was not revoking, but perfecting or correcting what God had already shown to mankind. According to Spiritism, the teachings of Christ are eternal because they are the very law given by God.

The origin of this law is not the Earth. Whe he said "My kingdom is not of this world" he was hinting on the heavenly origin of his teachings and the heavenly nature of the work he was doing. He did not come as a human Messiah to save physical lives and restore a temporal kingdom, but to spread the truth about the afterlife so that the spirits of people could evolve faster during their incarnations on Earth.

Christ also hinted on the plurality of inhabited planets, millennia before such a notion became widespread, when he said  "In my Father's house are many mansions". As a consequence of it, God's plan is much more complex than mankind can think of: "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God". 

Christ's moral is also strongly discussed, especially the Sermon of the Mount. Kardec argues that, assuming that we only live once, the apparent injustice of the world must be a reflection of God's injustice. On the other hand, considering that we live many times and that we carry from one life to the next the missions we left unfulfilled, the guilt for the wrongs we did against others, etc. the apparent injustice of the world reflects the compensation of the wrong done in previous lives. Kardec proposes the "Law of Cause and Effect" (an occidentalised version of the Hindu concept of Karma) and reinforces the monstruosity of homicide and suicide as the greatest sins against the law of God.

The Gospel... proposed the notion that adhering to Christ's teachings was a way to get rid of suffering, if not immediately, in a later life. Relying solely on the morality proposed by God we fulfil our missions in the world, stop accumulating guilt by doing wrong to others, and start repairing our past sins. Kardec chose this specific verse because, according to Spiritism, to follow the teachings of Christ is much easier and leads us to more comfort than refusing them: all suffering comes from denying to do what God wants us to, that's why Christ's yoke is light. But the central point of the chapter is that the Spiritist doctrine, being an expansion and a correction of the central teachings of Christ, is the consolation once promised by him. Therefore, "salvation" is not seen as the promotion to a "heaven", but in the literal sense.

Other Christian virtues, like modesty, humility and others are also examined and exhorted. But "Blessed are the meek" is presented in a quite unusual way. This chapter explains why did Christ promise inheritance on earth to the meek. His thesis is that, once everyone follows the teachings of Christ, the present situation (in which most worldly goods are under the control of wicked people) will be reverted. This agrees with chapter 3, in which Kardec demonstrates that Christ did teach that there are many worlds and that, as a consequence, there are more and less evolved worlds. The adoption of Christian principles makes a world evolve and become more pleasant to live.

Divine justice is presented as an extended and more thorough implementation of the Lex talionis: we are submitted to the same things we do unto others so that we learn that they are wrong. So, if we are merciful, God will have mercy on us too. The principle that "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" is seen, then, also as a protective measure to ensure us against suffering in the future. This chapter also argues that love must be taken into action, otherwise it is not love. It also deals with the separation between the state and the Church as expressed by Christ saying "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

According to Spiritism, charity must benefit anyone that needs ("Love your enemies"), regardless of faith (a significant moral improvement not yet universalised today). Because of this doctrine,  Spiritism should not proselitise; as proselitism could cause people to think that the Spiritist Centres did only help those ready to accept the doctrine. However, the central point of the chapter is that love must be universal, not limited by our preferences or affections. Kardec suggests that Christ may have really meant to say "love even your enemies" (that is, love should be extended to them, not started by them). One curiosity about this chapter is the extensive treaty on duels, because they were popular in France then. 

Helping the others is further approached when commenting Christ saying "Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth": The ideal situation is when the help is completely dissociated from any religious practice. In most spiritist centres that adhere to Kardec's teachings, charity has a different schedule than members' meetings and not a word is told about any doctrine, except for a vague invitation to "come around whenever you want to visit us or to seek help if you need" (which does not necessarily imply on coming to the meetings, but merely coming to meet the people you eventually befriend there). Another central teaching, closely related to the above, is that we shouldn't expect people to give us anything in return: to see them better should be our return.

While the Catholic Church usually explains "Many are called, but few are chosen" as an allusion to the minority of Christians that choose to be ordained, Spiritism explains the party of the king (Matthew 22) as a representation of how Israel was called by God but few of the Israelites effectively obeyed the call (and therefore were chosen). The parable is explained as a representation of spiritual life (we are constantly called by God, but every day few of us take heed of the call). This chapter is often used as a justification of why spiritism does not bother to become a major religion, provided that it survives.

Spiritism was accused of lax morality  because of its tolerance towards women. Not only did Kardec accept them as equal to men before God but effectively published that the spirits said that a man may chose to live as woman or vice-versa  to attain greater improvement. Sex, in Spiritism, is a transitional biological trait that exists among humans, but may be different or absent in other intelligent species of the Universe. Most of the mediums that channelled for Kardec were women, as well as some of the early leaders of Spiritism. 

The tolerance extended to marriage as well. When Christ said "Shall man not divide what God has united" is not seen as binding. God has established marriage, it is important for the improvement of mankind now, but it will eventually cease to be . Divorce is possible because the union provided by God is spiritual, not legal. Man cannot break a union that is united by God, so, any union that ends was not united by Him. Therefore, the indissolubility of marriage is relative because there are marriages based on misrepresentation of love, coercion on any or both the nubents or simply by mistake (when a person marries someone and later discovers a sound reason why the wedding should have never taken place). Spiritism accepts divorced people without any discrimination and accepts that they have the right to marry again (although it states that divorce should be an exception, not a rule).

Some other aspects detailed by Christ which become clearer when studied in the light of Spiritism are: 
 Faith moves mountains : although "miracles" (in the common meaning) do not exist, God effectively helps us and prayer can change our lives for better (though it does not actually move mountains...);
 The last hour workers : a late repentance is OK, if sincere, because we will have another life to pay for the wrong we did and, if we have enough time to repair some of the evil we spread our future may be less demanding.
 There will be false Christs and false prophets : deals with the usual accusation of apostasy and persuades the reader that "false Christs and false prophets" are not the proponents of Spiritism but those who uphold religious "truths" that contradict the core of the Christian message.

The last two doctrinal chapters of the The Gospel According to Spiritism come back to specifically spiritist themes. "Freely ye have received, freely give" establishes the rules why no religious service should be charged at all, as both the word of God and his "miracles" (interventions) are given to us freely. This chapter seems (from the sampled cases studied) to have had two aims: to criticise the Catholic Church for chargin to celebrate masses on behalf of the dead and to instruct true Spiritists not to fall to this, otherwise they would be called charlatans. "Ask, and it shall be given you" is about the importance of praying.

<doc id="1297630" title="Hierarchy of roads" nonfiltered="772" processed="764" dbindex="1480777">


The hierarchy of roads organizes the functions of different types of roads.  While sources differ on the exact nomenclature, in general they describe the same hierarchy.

 Freeways .
At the top of the hierarchy are limited access roads freeways or motorways, including most toll roads. These roads provide largely uninterrupted travel, often using partial or full access control, and are designed for high speeds. Some freeways have collector/distributor lanes (also known as local lanes) which further reduce the number of access ramps that directly interface with the freeway, rather the freeway periodically interfaces with these parallel roadways, which themselves have multiple on and off-ramps. These allow the freeway to operate with less friction at an even higher speed and with higher flow. Often freeways are included in the next category, arterials.

 Arterials .
The next level are arterials. In general, arterials are major through roads that are expected to carry large volumes of traffic. Arterials are often divided into major and minor arterials, and rural and urban arterials.

In some places there are large divided roads with few or no driveways that cannot be called freeways because they have occasional at-grade intersections with traffic lights that stop traffic (expressways in California, dual carriageways in UK ) or they are just too short (superarterials in Nevada).  Such roads are usually classified as arterials.

 Collectors .
These are followed by collectors (not to be confused with collector/distributor roads, which reduce weaving on freeways), which act to collect traffic from local roads and distribute it to arterials. Traffic using a collector is usually going to or coming from somewhere nearby.

 Local roads .
At the bottom of the hierarchy are local streets and roads. These roads have the lowest speed limit, and carry low volumes of traffic. In some areas, these roads may be unpaved.

 History .
Roads have been distinguished by function probably since their beginning, and the hierarchy of roads was firmly established by the time of the Roman Empire.

Access management.
The related concept of access management aims to provide access to land development while ensuring traffic flows freely and safely on surrounding roads. Frontage roads are often used to reduce the conflict between the high-speed nature of an arterial and property access concerns.

 United Kingdom .

While the above relates to the United States the UK has its own system.

Motorway - Same as freeway designated with an M prefix or (M) suffix. e.g M1, A1(M)

Primary A-road - Green on maps and signs. A main recommended route these can be either single carriageway or dual carriageway. The primary road network is fully connected, meaning you can reach any part from any other without leaving the network

Non-primary A-road - Often exists where the route is important but there is a nearby primary route (A or motorway) which duplicates this roads function. Shown as red on maps and with white signage

B road - Regional in nature and used to connect areas of lesser importance.

C road - Not officially signed or marked, C roads are used as local authority designations for routes within their area.

Unclassified - Local roads with no defined destination.

<doc id="4443073" title="Loss of right in English law" nonfiltered="773" processed="765" dbindex="1480778">

In the English law of tort, loss of right is a new heading of potential liability arising as a matter of policy to counteract limitations perceived in the more traditional rules of causation.

Loss of a right.
Recent medical negligence cases suggest tacit recognition of a more rights-based approach to damage. Under this approach, claimants who cannot establish causation using the traditional "but for" rules may nevertheless recover if they can show that in failing to fully advise of the risks inherent in treatment, a defendant has deprived them of the right either to choose a more experienced doctor or to defer the date of the treatment. In Chester v Afshar (2004) UKHL 41 the claimant was advised by the defendant surgeon to undergo surgery which carried a small (1-2%) but unavoidable risk of a seriously adverse result inherent in the procedure and not dependent on any characteristics of the patient. The surgeon did not warn her of that known risk, and she suffered serious nerve damage which left her partially paralysed. There was no evidence of negligence in the surgery itself. The alleged breach of duty was the failure to warn of the risk and the claimant had to prove that "but for" the failure to warn her, she would not have had the surgery. Lord Hope said:  It is plain that the  but for  test is not in itself a sufficient test of causation.  (para 72) but accepted:   that a solution to this problem which is in Miss Chester s favour cannot be based on conventional causation principles..  (para 81). Nevertheless, he thought that:  he issue of causation cannot be separated from issues about policy.  (para 85) and questioned whether in the unusual circumstances of this case, justice required the normal approach to causation to be modified, given that the issue which had arisen in this case raised an issue of legal policy which a judge must decide. The general view is that patient autonomy must be respected which is why the law has imposed a duty on doctors to give comprehensive information so that the patient can make an informed choice as to whether to have the operation. If there are known risks, some might find the choice whether to consent easy, but others would find the choice difficult and would wish to consider all options before taking the decision. Not to enforce the duty to warn of known risks would render the duty useless in the cases where it might be needed most. Lord Steyn said at para 19
   t is a distinctive feature of the present case that, but for the surgeon s negligent failure to warn the claimant of the small risk of serious injury the actual injury would not have occurred when it did and the chance of it occurring on a subsequent occasion was very small. It could therefore be said that the breach of the surgeon resulted in the very injury about which the claimant was entitled to be warned. ;
In general, it is not desirable to depart from established principles of causation, except for good reasons, the Lords held the right of autonomy and dignity justified a modification of the general rule in this case. (cf : Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 in Australia). Stevens argues that this decision is problematic. Suppose that a car being driven at an excessive speed is struck by a falling tree and a passenger is injured. It does not matter whether the risk of falling trees was foreseeable (e.g. because of prevailing weather conditions) that risk is not increased by driving too fast. The purpose of the rule imposing a duty to drive safely is to avoid traffic accidents not falling trees. In Chester v Afshar, the surgeon's breach of duty has not caused the patient to run any greater risk. If the purpose of the duty is solely to enable the patient to make an informed choice about whether to have the operation at all, the claimant's argument should fail. As Lord Hoffmann says at para 31:
"This argument is about as logical as saying that if one had been told, on entering a casino, that the odds on No 7 coming up at roulette were only 1 in 37, one would have gone away and come back next week or gone to a different casino.";
Although it is true that a patient may wish to take time to discuss the matter with family and friends and, possibly, seek a second opinion, the ultimate decision does not change the nature of the risk. It seems that the majority of the Lords wish to create an exception because the opportunity to reflect is itself deserving of respect.

Baybridge Canal ran 3.5 miles (6 km) through two locks. The canal was built entirely within the parish of  West Grinstead in the English county of Sussex. It was completed in 1826 using money raised from a £6000 share issue and from a £3000 mortgage. The canal largely followed the course of the River Adur to the point where it could be considered an improvement of a river navigation rather than a canal. The canal's main trade was manure, coal and chalk. The canal closed around 1875 due to competition from the railways.

Henry of Kalkar (b. at Kalkar in the Duchy of Cleves in 1328; d. at Cologne, 20 December1408) was a Carthusian writer.

Henry began his studies at Cologne, and completed them at Paris, where he became Master of Arts in 1357. He forthwith occupied the post of procurator of the German nation in 1358, being also a professor of theology. 

Having obtained canonries in the collegiate churches of St. Swibert in Kaiserswerth and St. George in Cologne in 1362, he returned to his native land. Soon after, however, disgusted with the world, he retired in 1365 to the Charterhouse of Cologne, where, owing to his talents and virtues, he was rapidly raised to the most important offices. 

Successively prior of the Charterhouses of Arnheim (1368-72), of Ruremonde (1372-77), which he had built, of Cologne (1377-84) and of Strasburg (1384-96), which he restored, and visitor of his province for the space of 20 years, he was thus called upon to play, under the circumstances produced by the Great Schism, a considerable role in the Netherlands and German-speaking countries. 

Relieved at length, at his earnest request, of all his offices, he retired in 1396 to the Charterhouse of Cologne, and there lived in recollection and prayer until his death. 

Henry of Kalkar was celebrated not only as a writer, but also as a reformer. During his priorate at Arnheim he had the happiness and honour of "converting" one of his friends and fellow-students at Paris, Gerard Groote (the future founder of the Brothers of the Common Life), whom he attracted into his Charterhouse and directed for three years. "Moreover by his spiritual writings . . . . he exercised on the whole school of Deventer and Windesheim the influence of a recognized master." He was to this extent the organizer of the great movement of the Catholic Renaissance, which, initiated at Windesheim and in the convents of the Low Countries, went on developing throughout the fifteenth century, finding its definite expression in the Council of Trent. 

Such was his reputation, that many attributed to him, though wrongly, the institution of the Rosary and the composition of the Imitation of Christ, and Peter Canisius went so far as to insert his name in his German martyrology for 20 December. 

Works.

As a writer he has left a number of works on very diverse subjects. At once a man of learning and letters, a distinguished musician, theologian, and ascetic, he composed the treatises: "Loquagium de rhetorica", "Cantuagium de musicâ", "De Continentiis et Distinctione Scientiarum", and was also the author of sermons, letters, treatises on the spiritual life, etc. 

These works, which have never been printed, are scattered about in different libraries   at Basle, Brussels, St. Gall, etc. One alone has been published and has enjoyed a strange career, the "Exercitatorium Monachale" or "Tractatus utilis proficere volentibus". Inserted in a number of manuscripts of the "Imitation" between the first and third books, it has sometimes passed as an unedited book of that work, and was published as such by Dr. Liebner at Göttingen in 1842. Several times reprinted, especially by J. B. Malou in his 1858 Recherches historiques et critiques sur le véritable auteur de l'Imitation, it has been translated into French (Waille, Paris, 1844) under the title "L'Imitation de J. C., livre inédit trouvé dans la bibliothèque de Quedlinbourg". It has in great part passed into the "Mystica theologia" (chap. I) of Henry of Balma, and into the treatise "De Contemplatione" (lib. I, art. xxi) of Denis the Carthusian, and, after having inspired Thomas à Kempis and Garcia de Cisneros, it furnished St. Ignatius himself with some ideas for his Exercises.

Andrea Brooke Ownbey is a former stripper from Georgia who won the title Miss Howard Stern in 2002. Andrea was home schooled from the age of 15. She currently lives in Georgia with her father. She has a high-pitched baby-like voice, her "thank you" catch phrase is often played on the Howard Stern Show, and the cast and crew of the Stern Show often highlight her low intelligence by asking her general knowledge questions. Andrea has claimed to suffer from chronic depression and low self-esteem. She is a part of Howard Stern's Wack Pack. Ownbey was married on January 10, 2007 and claims to have filed for divorce less than a month later on February 6, a claim her husband disputes.

2002.
Andrea first appeared on the Howard Stern Show on January 22, 2002, when she was dubbed "The World's Dumbest Stripper." Howard asked her general knowledge questions and she got 2 out of 8 correct. In this appearance, Andrea also demonstrated her table dancing skills for Howard. 

Andrea was invited to Las Vegas where she won the title "Miss Howard Stern" in a contest on February 8, 2002 during the Howard Stern Show broadcast from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. 

On May 16, 2002, Andrea again lost in a general knowledge quiz on the Howard Stern Show, this time against an 11-year-old boy.

2003.
On March 26, 2003, Andrea appeared on the Stern Show and revealed that she entices older men into paying her bills. Andrea also revealed that she had a daughter when she was 16, saying her then-boyfriend used protection but that it didn't work. She said she became depressed during the pregnancy, because she didn't want to get fat.

On October 17, 2003, Andrea was slated to play the "Smartest Stripper Contest" on the Howard Stern Show but never showed.  KC Armstrong, then-Stern Show producer, said that she was out drinking until 5 in the morning.

On October 20, 2003, Andrea competed in a preliminary round of the "Smartest Stripper Contest", which she won.  Her leg was in a cast - she said she kept hurting her feet and toes running into things.  She also said she was on antidepressants, which had greatly intensified the effects of the alcohol she had drunk the Friday before at Scores.

On November 4, 2003, Andrea came in to compete in a semi-final round of the "Smartest Stripper Contest", which she lost.  Andrea talked to Howard about the horrible headaches she has had for the past two years.  Andrea said that she doesn't like dancing anymore and that she wants to be an actress.  Stern Show producer Gary Dell'Abate told Howard that Andrea once gave him a great lap dance.

2004.
On February 12, 2004, Andrea was given a written IQ test to complete just prior to appearing on the Howard Stern Show.  On the show, she said that she had guessed at many of the answers; KC Armstrong said that she didn't provide any answer for 20 of the questions.  She received a score of 88.  Howard said that he had heard that Andrea had a crush on someone but she wouldn't say who it was.  The other Stern Show staff members thought it was KC, but Andrea was too embarrassed to say.  Howard told KC to ask Andrea out on a date, but KC declined, further fueling speculation among the cast that KC was gay. 

On March 17, 2004, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show and competed in a general knowledge quiz against Evan Marriott from the TV show Joe Millionaire.  Andrea lost.  Howard then further probed Andrea about her crush on KC.  Howard tried to get KC and Andrea to go out together, but neither agreed.

In May 2004, Andrea appeared at the Howard Stern Show broadcast from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.  Andrea said that she was on a diet and taking TrimSpa.  As part of the Vegas special, Andrea sat in one of the squares in the HollyWEIRD Squares game on May 12, 2004.  Howard asked Andrea why she was crying during the break, but she denied that anything was wrong.  (Later, she said she was sad because KC wasn't there in Vegas for the Stern show.)  Howard asked Andrea to spell 'imbecile' - she spelled it 'IMBESOLE'.  On May 14, 2004, again as part of the Vegas special, Andrea competed against fellow Wack Packer Beetlejuice in a general knowledge quiz for a chance to win $2,000.  Andrea lost, but she was given a $1,000 casino chip. 

On September 21, 2004, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show, saying she had just spent $16,000 to have porcelain veneers placed on all her teeth.  She also had lip injections.  Howard and Robin didn't like her new teeth, but Andrea said they make her feel more confident.  Gary said that Andrea seems to have an unlimited amount of money but he's not sure where it comes from - he had seen her genuine Gucci luggage in the green room.  Andrea said she had a secret boyfriend who died in August in a car accident.  Zolar came into the studio and said that his wife wants to divorce him because she thinks that he slept with Andrea.  Zolar also said that Andrea slept with a guy in Vegas with the name KC (not KC Armstrong).  Zolar also said that Andrea's husband is a nigger because he doesn't help pay for his kid. Andrea told Howard that her daughter is white, as the father of the child is half-black.

2005.
On April 21, 2005, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show and was very talkative.  She said she was on pain medication and had been out the night before drinking.  She also said she had gotten new breast implants three weeks earlier, her second set of implants, and that they were almost Double Ds.  She also had her lips further injected.  Howard told her that she should stop the plastic surgery.  Howard asked Andrea about a 74-year-old man she's been dating.  She said that he was just a friend but that he pays for things.  Andrea had lost a lot of weight, she said because she hardly eats anything.  Andrea said she found a job working at Hooters but got fired after one day for "causing too much attention".  At Howard's request Andrea wore a bikini but wouldn't show her bare breasts.  Howard then had Andrea don a t-shirt and remove her bikini top, after which Stern sidekick Artie used a super soaker water gun to soak her a la a wet T-shirt contest.

On July 21, 2005, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show to play "Reject Jeopardy" against fellow Wack Packer Wendy the Retard.  Andrea won with a score of 5-3 and received $5000.  Andrea said she had worked at Scores for a few days while she was in New York City, in order to earn some money. 

On December 16, 2005, Andrea attended Howard Stern's 'final show on terrestrial radio' rally in New York City.  Andrea delivered a speech about Howard, saying it had been a privilege and an honor to have been Miss Howard Stern - though the speech was not fully broadcast because staff member Sal Governale's voice accidentally was being broadcast as well.

2006.  
On May 23, 2006, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show to promote an independent movie she acted in called 'Dorm of the Dead'. During the interview, she revealed she had sex "eight or nine times" with former Stern staff member KC Armstrong over the course of a weekend and ceased the relationship after KC's ex-girlfriend discovered it. She also drank Jack Daniel's whiskey during the interview, becoming noticeably drunk. She rode the Sybian in exchange for keeping her Miss Howard Stern title for an additional five years.

On July 24, 2006, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show to sing a live duet with country singer-songwriter Trent Tomlinson. Tomlinson's song, Drunker Than Me, was previously sung karaoke-style by a drunken Andrea and has been frequently played on the show. Andrea revealed that her 6-year-old daughter's name is Beyoncé, perhaps inspired by Beyoncé Knowles. The staff found this particularly humorous given the fact that the father of Andrea's daughter is believed to be African American. Artie Lange suggested that Andrea would name her next child, Ludacris making reference to the African American rapper.

On October 19, 2006, Andrea called into the Howard Stern Show. She said she had attended rehab and was now drug-free, though she was still drinking. She told Howard that she won a custody battle for her daughter without a lawyer.  Howard asked Andrea if she would like to be audiotaped while having sex with KC Armstrong.  Andrea said she would like to be with KC again but that she didn't think that he would be up for it.  Andrea told Howard she had made out with porn actress Ginger Lynn and how much she had enjoyed it.  Gary Dell'Abate asked Andrea if she slept with Trent Tomlinson; Andrea said that she did have sex with him but that he would be upset with her for saying that.  Howard called KC on-the-air and discussed plans to have the sounds of KC and Andrea's sexual intercourse recorded. KC wanted to give Andrea Anal Sex. KC's girlfriend Candle, hearing of the idea, vetoed it.

2007.
On February 7, 2007, Andrea appeared on the Howard Stern Show along with Crackhead Bob and Reverend Bob Levy to participate in the Porn Stars Vs. Slow Adults Game. (The porn stars won 6-4.)  It was revealed that Andrea is still drinking and she has been in 13 car accidents (two of her teeth got knocked out in one accident).  Staff member Benjy Bronk said that Andrea had asked him for coke in the green room.  Andrea denied that and said that weed and alcohol are fine, but she's not looking to get coke. It was also revealed that Andrea got married on January 10, but she was getting a divorce because her husband allegedly is a mental case and obsessed fan, and she never loved him and she only wanted to get a ring.  Later on in the show, Andrea's husband called in and spoke to Howard about his marriage and what Andrea had said about him.

Premise.

There  are  the need  to  consider  if  the occurrence of the self-awareness of people, just  13 billions years after so called Big Bang  and  evoked  by conscious decisions  fast and permanent  drive  to understand  everything and  progress in  technology is random?



Recently these considerations and  trials of the  formulation of  the world view  incorporating phenomena of life and consciousness  in  cosmological models  of the Universe led  to the  " Theory of necessity of people's participation in reoccurence of sub - Universe". Its thesis, expressed in another words states:  " People will create a new sub- Universe " or  " People go to be  the new Demiurge ". The essential  concept of this theory is illustrated intuitively by fig. 1.

Authors.

Lee Smolin who developed the theory of  cosmological natural selection suggests that universes fecund universes evolve in favor of the production of black holes.
Louis Crane goes one step futher and maintains   that universes could be fine-tuned for life by intelligent beings themselves manufacturing new universes. Alan Guth and Michio Kaku also have  speculated  that a civilization at the top of the Kardashev scale might create fine-tuned universes in a continuation of the evolutionary drive to exist. In the light of  A.Guth's and L.Crane's speculations the distant progeny of people will play the role of  Plato's  Demiurge.

Even the most generalized version of the multiverse theory, published recently by a  known system scientist  Ervin Laszlo (see references), who coined the notion of Metaverse must be confronted with the thesis formulated in the premise to this entry. Laszlo  posits  that the "quantum vacuum" is the fundamental energy and information-carrying field that informs not just the current universe, but all universes past and present. He believes  that  this kind of field  can " explain why our universe is so improbably fine-tuned as to form galaxies and conscious life forms; and why evolution is an informed, not random, process ". 

The presented theory posits however that people ( intelligent inhabitans of  past and present universes )  are  involved in the process of the mentioned  " improbably fine-tuning ". The authors of the theory argue that occurrence of  consciousness as a new neuro -physiological phenomenon  is not random. They maintain that anybody of us is indispensable for the realization of an extremely important task.: "  We are indispensable to succeed to reproduce the new real world ".

People in the context of the evolving Universe.

In details the authors of the theory argue that the actual phase of the development of the Universe, characterized by occurrence of the self-awareness of people should be understand  in the context of the evolving Universe. 

The contemporary cosmologists maintain that the Universe comes out from primary singularity, it means from a very dense bunch of matter or ' quantum foam '. The singularity existed above time. During the first cosmologic era the primary physical particles appeared. The early Universe was composed from Hydrogen and Helium. More heavy elements occurred inside of the older stars. We know already that many stellar systems are characterized by the presence of  planets. 

At the surface of the planets ( at last on our planet ) so called biological life has emerged . Recently, after 13 billions year of the cosmic evolution the Homo sapiens sapiens appeared. Human beings are characterized by the self-awareness. It is almost improbably that the occurrence of  biological life and consciousness was random. It is rather a cosmic necessity. The existence of  a galaxy is probably the indispensable condition. It would 
be difficult to imagine a planetary stellar system with the biological life on the surface of the planet existing in the intergalactic cosmic void. If we will admit that the biological life is a cosmic necessity the quick formation of galaxies in the expanding universe should be comprehended as an important  step in the creation of the elementary conditions for the occurrence of the biological life. 

The appearance of human self-awareness is indispensable to take decisions about important acts related to the fate of human beings. 

People are inquisitive and unconsciously motivated to increase the knowledge and technological abilities. It enables them to develop the communication and  memorizing systems. They quickly transforms our planet in a kind of a huge global brain. It is only first step to much more far reaching goals. Just now  people want to analyze, record and understand the genetic code. In fact they want to understand the code representation of everything.

Is emulation of people on second level of implementation necessary?.
  
Frank Tipler, , the author of  The Anthropic Cosmological Principle ( see references ) is also the author of the book sub title: " The physics of immortality - Modern cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead " (see references ). He presents in this book probably unique other similar trial to search for  meaning of the human life. His vision of  cosmological development foresees that the descendants of people will build, in the far future, the huge macro - computer based on the matter of the collapsing universe. It will enable the emulation ( reconstruction, in fact resurrection ) of all  people who lived before. 

Frank Tipler' s theory works  only on the assumption that the time space of the Universe is closed (see Big Crunch) and that it will collapse in the future. In 1998 (after the formulation of Tipler's theory in 1995) astronomers found strong arguments that our Universe is "open" (see Stephen Perlmutter and co." Discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe ",(1998),Nature, 391, 6662) and that the time space will expand endlessly ,Big Freeze.

So,  the " Theory of necessity of people's  participation in reoccurence of sub - Universe"  take into account, that probably our Universe will expand, adulterate  and freeze endlessly. The authors of the theory believe however, that people intuitively try to escape the disastrous fate of the civilization living in the  attenuating and freezing Universe. The intelligent inhabitants  of  the present Universe  have  probably unconscious drive to understand everything and develop high technology, especially information processing technology ( see the anticipation of so called Technological singularity. Probably it is the begining of the mentioned drive to build the macro-computer and to implement the essence, especially brains  and human psyche on so called second level of implementation. The development of the global Internet, the urge to construct so called virtual reality or simulated reality and  the  main postulate of all religions about further existence in ' other world ' as well the recent vision of futurologists Vernor Vinge, Ray Kurzweil and many science fiction writers ( Greg Egan, Stephen Baxter ), what give usually a good insights,  push authors of the theory to prediction that really people will ' scan ' themselves and emulate in the cyberspace. It seems that it is  necessary to obtain a much faster and intense development of the thinking and cognition, as well dispersed conscious, inteligent system integrated with the material substance of galaxies. 

The ultimate goal of people.

Probably the ultimate goal of people is to do something with the sad vision of cooling, dilatating, infinitely expanded time space of our Universe.  Probably the descendant of us will try to utilize a massive black hole as a tool appropriate to begin the next offspring Universe   Mighty knowledge, technology and power is necessary however to program and tune the characteristics of the next Big ( Little )  Bang in such a manner that ensures the offspring Universe will also obey the Anthropic Principle . It would cause the similar evolution of the offspring Universe, who should lead to the occurrence of human beings, that will signify in fact the 'reincarnation' of the human species.

Thus people and their descendants of the present Universe will want to master the ability to tune the next Big Bang: Therefore they need to decode genomic information and also the patterns for all reality, including the pattern of the physical and chemical characteristics of matter.  The code representation of all objects should be determined.  People, who know scientific endeavors will agree that in fact the trial of the understanding of everything has already began.

Metaphysical importance of the theory.

Many authors presented similar speculations on  subjects   of  "fine-tuned universe", 
"ultimate fate of the universe", "strong ( final ) version of the Anthropic Principle","Intelligent Design" and others. Hitherto, the authors of these speculations omit however  the role of people in the fate of Universe.

It is astonishing  because,  from the another hand people are desperate  by the lack of opinion  or theories  related  to  meaning of their existence. Furthermore the "Theory of necessity of people's participation in reoccurence of sub - Universe" unawares indicates  for the possibility to consider  unification of religious and cosmological concepts.
It is illustrated by fig. 2 , which  suggests the rational for emulation of people on so called second level of implementation, what  means simply some kind of  their resurrection. Frank Tipler's theory foresaw  this possibility for  the  cosmological model of the closed Universe. Fig. 2  illustrates  how the same  concept  is usefulness  in compass of  similar theory,  but taking into account the cosmological model of the open Universe. The phases  of  the  evolution of the  Universe,  mentioned on the upper part of the scheme are  scientifically substantiated. The elements  of  the cycle mentioned on the lower part of the scheme are rather speculative. How future progeny of  people will realize  the  tuning of next singularity probably will be yet long the matter of  hypothetical speculations. Theory of necessity of people's participation in reoccurence of sub - Universe,  in some sense is opposite to the concept of   "Intelligent Design". Here the sub - Universe is designed by the former Universe. It resolves old metaphysical  problem, that the "designer"  cannot be simpler that his product. The theory implies also third possibility  to the metaphysical and religious controversy. Instead of random occurrence or the creation by God the possibility exists that the Universe was created by conscious inhabitants of former, past version of the Universe, who played the role of  Demiurge, conceived as in old Plato's metaphysics.

Importance of the theory for  psychological and social condition of people. 

The presented theory restores the meaning of the human life.  It explains why the effort of people is valuable and that this effort will be rewarded by the possibility of reoccurence.
The theory emerged from the trial of the unification of biological and cosmological notions, however it has implications for the emotional condition of people.  Contemporary people need well justified tasks which point out the important mission, creating ideological or metaphysical motivations of their endavours.  As one of the reviewers of Ervin Laszlo's mentioned book  wrote, 'Much of the chaos and social dislocation that we observe daily, is not something that is "just happening," but is a result of our own lack of coherence and vision'.

Ringnes is the largest brewer in Norway. It was founded in 1876 by brothers Amund and Ellef Ringnes (Amund was the brewer, Ellef the administrator and salesman) and financial director Axel Heiberg.  The company's brewery in the Grünerløkka district of Oslo produced its first beer in 1877.

The company sponsored the polar expeditions of Fridtjof Nansen and Otto Sverdrup. During his exploration of the high Canadian arctic in 1900, Sverdrup named three large islands after his sponsors (Axel Heiberg Island, Amund Ringnes Island, and Ellef Ringnes Island).

Ringnes remained a family-owned business until 1978, when it merged with De sammensluttede Bryggerier A/S (which had been formed by the union of drinks companies Frydenlund and Schous) forming Nora Industrier.  Nora in turn merged with Orkla Group in 1991.  Orkla placed Ringnes into a combined business unit, together with Swedish brewer Pripps.  In 2000 Orkla made a deal with Danish drinks giant Carlsberg whereby Pripps Ringnes became a part of Carlsberg, in exchange for Orkla owning 40% of Carlsberg.  When, in 2004, Carlsberg bought out Orkla's shares, Ringnes was for the first time entirely owned by a foreign company.  Christian Ringnes, a descendant of the founder told daily business newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv that "a country without a leading beer brand is like a man without potency" , and called the sale a national catastrophe.

Paul Jaworski was the leader of the "Flatheads" gang, who committed the first armored car robbery on March 11 1927.   The group stole over $100,000 from an armored vehicle on Bethel Road, 7 miles outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The bandits placed a landmine under the roadbed, and made off with the money that was on its way to Coverdale for the Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Company. The gang was also known for the payroll robbery of the Detroit News business offices in 1928, which lead to the capture or death of most of the gang.

Jaworski was executed via electric chair for a separate payroll robbery which resulted in a murder in Pennsylvania.

Finnish military ranks form a system that incorporates features from Swedish, German, and  Russian armed forces. In addition, it has some typically Finnish characteristics that are mostly due to the personnel structure of the Finnish Defence Forces. The ranks have official names in Finnish and Swedish languages and official  English translations. The Swedish forms are used in all Swedish-languages communications in Finland, e.g. in Swedish-speaking units of Finnish Defence Force.

Exceptions.
Conscripts and salaried officers.
Any contracted member of the Defence Forces is senior to any conscript, regardless of rank. An insignia in the shape of a sword is added to the rank insignia to denote this for NCOs. That is, a contracted NCO with the rank of sergeant (insignia: three chevrons, a sword) is senior to a conscript senior sergeant (insignia: four chevrons). Also, the military police has separate command authority (stemming from the base commander) for military law enforcement purposes.

General officers.
The ranks of Field Marshal (sotamarsalkka) and Marshal of Finland (Suomen marsalkka) were bestowed on Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in 1933 and 1942, respectively. These are officially not military ranks but honorific titles, but were used like military ranks senior to the rank of General. The rank of General may, as a sign of special recognition, include a service branch: those historically used were General of Infantry (jalkaväenkenraali), General of Cavalry (ratsuväenkenraali) and General of Artillery (tykistökenraali). These additions do not affect seniority. (There are no living general officers with such recognition.)

Military civil servants and specialist officers.
Personnel serving in technical duties belonging to the officers without officer training hold the position of military civil servant (sotilasvirkamies). Their rank is comparable to either 1st Lieutenant, Lieutenant and Chief Warrant officer, depending on the level of the civilian education required to serve in this position. The lowest class is reserved for non-salaried military civil servants. Usually the military civil servants are an exception as their positions are likely to be filled by special officers, who have received officer training and hold commissions in addition to civilian academic education. 

Reservists may be promoted up to the rank of Major both in special and normal officer ranks. In rare cases, reservists have been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

Chaplains serve in the ranks of Chaplain (sotilaspastori), Senior Chaplain (kenttärovasti, literally, Field Dean), and Chaplain General (kenttäpiispa, literally, Field Bishop), corresponding to the ranks of Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Brigadier General, respectively. In addition, they have a personal rank into which they revert at the end of their clerical service in the Finnish Defence Force. Conscript chaplains and deacons serve in their personal rank.

Officer training.
Conscripts who have passed a reserve officer course, serve as Officer Cadets (Upseerikokelas) and are considered NCOs. At the end of their service period, they are promoted 2nd Lieutenants. Cadets (Kadetti) are career military, attending their professional officer education in the National Defence College. Cadets attending the fourth year in National Defence College are senior to Lieutenants. Other Cadets are senior to 2nd Lieutenants. In addition, the cadets may hold a cadet NCO rank which pertains to the seniority inside the Cadet Corps but does not affect their ranks in relation to other military personnel.

NCO ranks.
The NCO ranks in the Finnish Defence Force are filled by conscripts, career NCOs and contractual military personnel. The basic NCO rank is Enlistee (sotilasammattihenkilö), which is a rank and file position. Its relation to other rank and file ranks is unspecified; however, being contracted personnel, they always rank above any conscript. Career NCOs usually serve in the ranks of Chief Warrant Officer,, ylivääpeli (Senior Warrant Officer), Warrant Officer, Staff Seargeant and Seargeant. The contractual military personnel (sopimussotilaat) serve as Staff Seargeants, Corporals or Lance Corporals. After discharge from the military, both enlistees and contractual military personnel revert to their reserve ranks. The conscripts may hold the NCO ranks of Officer Cadet, Seargeant, Officer Student, or Corporal. Reserve personnel may hold any NCO rank.

Privates.
Sotamies is the generic rank for Private, however the word sotamies is no longer used in any service branch. The rank is always given the name specific to the service branch: 

Jaeger (jääkäri) in infantry;
Signalist (viestimies) in signals corps;
Armourman (panssarimies) or Armour Jaeger (panssarijääkäri) in armoured troops  ;
Driver (autosotamies) in transport corps;
Gunner (tykkimies) in anti-aircraft corps, field artillery and coastal units of the Navy;
NBC private (suojelumies) in NBC defence units;
Engineer (pioneeri) in engineers ;
Frontier Jaeger (rajajääkäri) in the Border Guard (Conscript rank, enlisted Border Guard personnel are NCOs in ranks of  nuorempi rajavartija, vanhempi rajavartija and ylirajavartija.);
Airman (lentosotamies) in the Air Force;
Seaman (matruusi) in the Navy;
Coastal Jaeger (rannikkojääkäri) in certain units of Uusimaa Brigade (Uudenmaan prikaati);
Dragoon (rakuuna) in the Dragoon troop of Army Warfare School (Rakuunaeskadroona/Maasotakoulu);
Cavalryman (ratsumies) in the Häme Regiment (Hämeen rykmentti);
Guard Jaeger (kaartinjääkäri) in Guard Jaeger Regiment (Kaartin jääkärirykmentti);
Paratroop jaeger (laskuvarjojääkäri) in Utti Jaeger Regiment (Utin jääkärirykmentti);

NCO students hold either the permanent rank of Private or Lance Corporal and rank accordingly.

Marketing ethics is the area of applied ethics which deals with the moral principles behind the operation and regulation of marketing. Some areas of marketing ethics (ethics of advertising and promotion) overlap with media ethics.

Fundamental issues in marketing ethics.
Frameworks of analysis for marketing ethics.
Possible frameworks:
 Value-orientated framework, analysing ethical problems on the basis of the values which they infringe (e.g. honesty, autonomy, privacy, transparency). An example of such an approach is the AMA Statement of Ethics.;
 Stakeholder-orientated framework, analysing ethical problems on the basis of whom they affect (e.g. consumers, competitors, society as a whole).
 Process-orientated framework, analysing ethical problems in terms of the categories used by marketing specialists (e.g. research, price, promotion, placement).

None of these frameworks allow, by themselves, a convenient and complete categorisation of the great variety of issues in marketing ethics.

Power-based analysis.
Contrary to popular impressions, not all marketing is adversarial, and not all marketing is stacked in favour of the marketer. In marketing, the relationship between producer/consumer or buyer/seller can be adversarial or cooperative. For an example of cooperative marketing, see relationship marketing. If the marketing situation is adversarial, another dimension of difference emerges, describing the power balance
between producer/consumer or buyer/seller. Power may be concentrated with the producer (caveat emptor),
but factors such as over-supply or legislation can shift the power towards the consumer (caveat vendor). Identifying where the power in the relationship lies and whether the power balance is relevant at all are important to understanding the background to an ethical dilemma in marketing ethics.

 Is marketing inherently evil? .
A popularist anti-marketing stance commonly discussed on the blogosphere and popular literature is that any kind of marketing is inherently evil. The position is based on the argument that marketing necessarily commits at least one of three wrongs:
 Damaging personal autonomy. The victim of marketing in this case is the intended buyer whose right to self-determination is infringed.
 Causing harm to competitors. Excessively fierce competition and unethical marketing tactics are especially associated with saturated markets.;
 Manipulating social values. The victim in this case is society as a whole, or the environment as well. The argument is that marketing promotes consumerism and waste. See also: affluenza, ethical consumerism, anti-consumerism.

Specific issues in marketing ethics.
Market research.
Ethical danger points in market research include:
 Invasion of privacy.
 Stereotyping.

Stereotyping occurs because any analysis of real populations needs to make approximations and place individuals into groups. However if conducted irresponsibly, stereotyping can lead to a variety of ethical undesirable results. In the AMA Statement of Ethics, stereotyping is countered by the obligation to show respect ("acknowledge the basic human dignity of all stakeholders").

Market audience.
Ethical danger points include:
 Targeting the vulnerable (e.g. children, the elderly).
 Excluding potential customers from the market: selective marketing is used to discourage demand from undesirable market sectors or disenfranchise them altogether.

Examples of unethical market exclusion or selective marketing are past industry attitudes to the gay, ethnic minority and
obese ("plus-size") markets. Contrary to the popular myth that ethics and profits do not mix,
the tapping of these markets has proved highly profitable. For example, 20% of US clothing sales are now plus-size. Another example is the selective marketing of health care, so that unprofitable sectors (i.e. the elderly) will not
attempt to take benefits to which they are entitled.
A further example of market exclusion is the pharmaceutical industry's exclusion of developing countries
from AIDS drugs.

Examples of marketing which unethically targets the elderly include: living trusts, time share fraud, mass marketing fraud and others.
The elderly hold a disproportionate amount of the world's wealth and are therefore the target of financial exploitation.

In the case of children, the main products are unhealthy food, fashionware and entertainment goods. Children are a lucrative market: "...children 12 and under spend more than $11 billion of their own money and influence family spending decisions worth another $165 billion", but are not capable of resisting or understanding marketing tactics at younger ages ("children don't understand persuasive intent until they are eight or nine years old"). At older ages competitive feelings towards other children are stronger than financial sense. The practice of extending children's marketing from television to the schoolground is also controversial (see marketing in schools). The following is a select list of online articles:
 Sharon Beder, Marketing to Children (University of Wollongong, 1998).
 Miriam H. Zoll, Psychologists Challenge Ethics Of Marketing To Children (American News Service, 2000);
 Donnell Alexander and Aliza Dichter, Ads And Kids: How Young Is Too Young?;
 Rebecca Clay, Advertising to children: Is it ethical? (Monitor on Psychology, Volume 31, No. 8 Sept. 2000);
 Media Awareness Network, How marketers target kids;

Other vulnerable audiences include emerging markets in developing countries, where the public may not be sufficiently aware of skilled marketing ploys transferred from developed countries, and where, conversely, marketers may not be aware how excessively powerful their tactics may be. See Nestle infant milk formula scandal. Another vulnerable group are mentally unstable consumers. The definition of vulnerability is also problematic: for example, when should endebtedness be seen as a vulnerability and when should "cheap" loan providers be seen as loan sharks, unethically exploiting the economically disadvantaged?

Pricing ethics.


List of unethical pricing practices.
 price fixing;
 price skimming;
 price discrimination;
 variable pricing;
 predatory pricing;
 supra competitive pricing;
 price war;
 bid rigging;
 dumping (pricing policy);

Ethics in advertising and promotion.
Content.

Ethical pitfalls in advertising and promotional content include:
 Issues over truth and honesty. In the 1940's and 1950's, tobacco used to be advertised as promoting health. Today an advertiser who fails to tell the truth not only offends against morality but also against the law. However the law permits "puffery" (a legal term). The difference between mere puffery and fraud is a slippery slope: "The problem... is the slippery slope by which variations on puffery can descend fairly quickly to lies." See main article: false advertising.
 Issues with violence, sex and profanity. Sexual innuendo is a mainstay of advertising content (see sex in advertising), and yet is also regarded as a form of sexual harassment. Violence is an issue especially for children's advertising and advertising likely to be seen by children.
 Taste and controversy. The advertising of certain products may strongly offend some people while being in the interests of others. Examples include: feminine hygiene products, hemorrhoid and constipation medication. The advertising of condoms has become acceptable in the interests of AIDS-prevention, but are nevertheless seen by some as promoting promiscuity. Some companies have actually marketed themselves on the basis of controversial advertising - see Benetton. Sony has also frequently attracted criticism for unethical content (portrayals of Jesus which enfuriated religious groups; racial innuendo in marketing black and white versions of its PSP product; graffiti adverts in major US cities).;
 Negative advertising techniques, such as attack ads. In negative advertising, the advertiser highlights the disadvantages of competitor products rather than the advantages of their own. The methods are most familiar from the political sphere: see negative campaigning.

Delivery channels.
 Direct marketing is the most controversial of advertising channels, particularly when approaches are unsolicited. TV commercials and direct mail are common examples. Electronic spam and telemarketing push the borders of ethics and legality more strongly.
 Shills and astroturfers are examples of ways for delivering a marketing message under the guise of independent product reviews and endorsements, or creating supposedly independent watchdog or review organisations. For example, fake reviews can be published on Amazon. Shills are primarily for message-delivery, but they can also be used to drive up prices in auctions, such as Ebay auctions.;

The use of ethics as a marketing tactic.
Business ethics has been an increasing concern among larger companies, at least since the 1990's. Major corporations increasingly fear the damage to their image associated with press revelations of unethical practices. Marketers have been among the fastest to perceive the market's preference for ethical companies, often moving faster to take advantage of this shift in consumer taste. This results in the expropriation of ethics itself as a selling point or a component of a corporate image.
 The Body Shop is an example of a company which marketed itself and its entire product range solely on an ethical message. "The Body Shop s only real product is honesty..." (Jon Entine in a 1996 ethics audit of the company). However the story of the Body Shop ended with increasing criticism of a gap between its morals and its practices.
 Greenwash is an example of a strategy used to make a company appear ethical when its unethical practices continue.
 Liberation marketing is another strategy whereby a product can masquerade behind an image that appeals to a range of values, including ethical values related to lifestyle and anti-consumerism.;
"Liberation marketing takes the old mass culture critique   consumerism as conformity   fully into account, acknowledges it, addresses it, and solves it. Liberation marketing imagines consumers breaking free from the old enforcers of order, tearing loose from the shackles with which capitalism has bound us, escaping the routine of bureaucracy and hierarchy, getting in touch with our true selves, and finally, finding authenticity, that holiest of consumer grails." (Thomas Frank)


Marketing strategy.
The main theoretical issue here is the debate between free markets and regulated markets.
In a truly free market, any participant can make or change the rules. However when new rules
are invented which shift power too suddenly or too far, other participants may respond with
accusations of unethical behaviour, rather than modifying their own behaviour to suit (which they
might not be able to anyway). Most markets are not fully free: the real debate is as to the
appropriate extent of regulation.

Case: California electricity crisis, which demonstrates how constant innovation of
new marketing strategies by companies such as Enron outwitted the regulatory bodies
and caused substantial harm to consumers and competitors.

A list of known unethical or controversial marketing strategies:
 bait and switch;
 pyramid scheme;
 planned obsolescence;
 vendor lock-in / vendor lock-out;
 viral marketing / guerilla marketing;
 anti-competitive practices;

Controversial marketing strategies associated with the internet:
 search engine optimisation;
 spamdexing;
 embrace, extend and extinguish;
 spyware / adware;

 Further issues in marketing ethics .
Marketing ethics overlaps with environmental ethics in respect of waste problems associated with the packaging of products.

Regulation and enforcement.


Marketing ethics and marketing law are related subjects. Relevant areas of law include consumer law which protects consumers and antitrust law which protects competitors - in both cases, against unethical marketing practices. Regulation extends beyond the law to lobbies, watchdog bodies and self-regulatory industry bodies.

"Taking the Stone" is an episode from the second season of the American television series Farscape, written by Justin Monjo and directed by Rowan Woods.

Synopsis.
Chiana is distraught--she has a "life disk" implanted in her abdomen, which lets her know if her brother Nerri is still alive or not. Through it she learns he is dead, and, when Crichton is too busy to talk to her, she steals Aeryn's prowler and travels to a nearby cemetary planet, where she encounters a bunch of teenagers living a strange, wild life there. The Moyans pursue her, and Rygel robs a grave of its many valuables and takes them back to Moya. Aeryn and John find Chiana. They discover that the planet emits a radiation that kills everyone when they're young, so everyone is supposed to kill themselves before they reach that point. They do so by jumping into a big pit, where there is a PK sound device that creates an anti-gravity cushion to brake their fall. If they don't do it a certain way, they are killed by the fall, in an action called "taking the stone." They also consume hallucinatory mushrooms that frequently result in death. The increasingly erratic Crichton consumes one mushroom in order to gain the confidence of their leader. He tries to convince Chiana to return to Moya, but she is drawn to the wild teens. Eventually, she becomes convinced when Crichton shows how their leader is deceitful and does things harmful to the others, and she returns. But first, she wants to jump into the pit, face upward, to see if she is brave enough. She does, and she and Crichton exult.

Soumaïla Cissé (December 20, 1949 - ) is a Malian politician.

Born in Timbuctu, Soumaïla Cissé studied at l'Institut des Sciences de l'Ingénieur de Montpellier in France to become a software engineer.  He worked in several large French companies (IBM-France, le Groupe Pechiney, le Groupe Thomson and the aerospace company Air Inter) before returning to Mali in 1984 to work at the Compagnie malienne pour le développement des textiles (CMDT).

With his creation of the Alliance pour la démocratie au Mali-Parti africain pour la solidarité et la justice ("Alliance for democracy in Mali/African Party for solidarity and justice," ADEMA/PASJ), he became the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Republic following the 1992 election of Alpha Oumar Konaré.  In 1993, he was named Minister of Finances, then in 2000, Minister of Equipment, Management of Territory, Environment, and Urban Planning in the government of Mandé Sidibé.  In January 2002, he resigned from the government to devote himself to preparation for the presidential election, and ADEMA/PASJ selected him as their candidate to follow Alpha Oumar Konaré.  Cissé took second place in the first round of voting, but lost to Amadou Toumani Touré in the second round.

Considering himself thrown over by a faction of ADEMA/PASJ, Cissé left the party with a group of loyalists to found the Union pour la république et la démocratie (URD) in June 2003.

Soumaïla Cissé is currently president of the Commission of the West African Monetary Union (UEMOA).

Firepower: The Royal Artillery Museum is a military museum in Woolwich in south-east London, England, which tells the story of the Royal Regiment of Artillery and of the Royal Arsenal.

The museum is located in some of the former buildings of the Royal Arsenal, which was the British Government's principal ordnance manufacturing facility from the early 18th century until the mid 20th century. Since the turn of the millennium the Royal Arsenal site has been undergoing a mixed use redevelopment, and Firepower is one of the anchor features of this project. 

The forerunner of Firepower was the Royal Military Repository, which was established on the Royal Arsenal site in May 1778. After a fire in 1802 the surviving artefacts were rehoused in the Old Royal Military Academy. In 1820 the main collection was moved to the Rotunda on Woolwich Common. The collection moved to Firepower in April 2001. All of Firepower's buildings were once part of the Royal Laboratory Department, which controlled the manufacture of ammunition. The Old Military Academy is grade II* listed and some of the other buildings used by Firepower are grade II listed.

Firepower has large collections of historic and modern weapons. It is comprised of the following sections:

 Breech cinema: Shows an introductory film.
 Field of fire: An interactive exhibit with sound, smoke, screens and vibrations designed to give visitors an idea of what it is like to be a modern gunner in war time. ;
 The Gunnery Hall: The museum's main display of 20th century weapons.
 The History Gallery: This covers the history of artillery from slings and arrows onwards.
 Medals Gallery: Displays a selection from the museums collection of thousands of medals won by members of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and tells some of the stories behind them.
 Real Weapon Gallery: An interactive exhibition about ammunition.

<doc id="1674184" title="Heracross" nonfiltered="796" processed="788" dbindex="1480802">


 is one of the  fictional species of Pokémon from the Pokémon Franchise   a series of video games, anime, manga, books, trading cards and other media created by Satoshi Tajiri.

Heracross is a beetle-like Pokémon, clearly modelled on the hercules beetle, a beetle named after the mythological hero Heracles.

Appearance.
Heracross is a large, beetle-like, winged bipedal insect. Its entire body is blue. It has a capsule-shaped thorax similar to Pinsir's, a pair of yellow eyes and two clawed arms and feet. Growing from its head is a large T-shaped horn, which is flanked on either side by a smaller antenna. Starting with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the end of female Heracross' horns are somewhat heart-shaped. When it first appeared, many thought it would be the evolved form of Pinsir although they are not related. Heracross is able to destroy a big building in a single blow.

Biology.
Heracross is a powerful but docile Pokémon. Its natural habitat is forests and its diet consists of tree sap and honey. Its strength is such that it can topple large trees if it so wished.

Heracross is endowed both defensively and offensively, giving it excellent protection against potential predators. Its body is entirely covered in a shell as hard as steel, which wards off many attacks. Heracross's main weapon is its large horn, of which it is particularly proud. However, it only uses it in the wild to deter its foes, not hurt them.

To chase off intruders, Heracross tends to charge at them in a straight line, diving beneath them, scooping them up by thrusting its horn under their belly, and finally flinging them away with considerable force. Thanks to its power, Heracross can easily lift in this way foes a hundred times heavier than it is (5400 kg). It keeps a steady footing while doing this by planting its claws into the ground or a tree trunk.

In the video games.

In Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal, Heracross could be encountered by using the Headbutt move on trees in mountainous areas of the Johto region. In Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, Heracross are located in the Safari Zone. In Pokémon Colosseum, Heracross is a Shadow Pokémon and can be Snagged in Realgam Tower. In Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Heracross are available in Pattern Bush.

Heracross stats are decent and generally above-average, especially their very high attack and high special defense. Heracross can further raise their attack by using their Swords Dance technique.

Heracross are often used in a purely offensive manner in battle, since they learn many powerful physical moves that match their types, such as Brick Break, Rock Slide, Reversal and their signature move, Megahorn. When Heracross were first introduced, their unique knowledge of Megahorn made them a good counter to Psychic-type Pokémon, if a rather risky one due to their Fighting type. Their type combination of Bug and Fighting make them weak to Fire and Psychic attacks, and twice as weak to Flying-type attacks.  However they're resistant to five types: Fighting, Grass, Ground, Bug and Dark. While their Rock Slide technique can be used to cover the Flying-type weakness, the speed of flying-type Pokémon generally makes this a risky play. It is also a good candidate for the Endure/Reversal combo, seeing as it learns both of these moves naturally.

Heracross' unique typing makes it unusual as it has type advantages of many types, it is well known for using Megahorn as a counter against many high defense Pokémon like Umbreon and Claydol.

In the anime.
Heracross was Ash's first Johto pokemon and is one of the Pokémon Ash has used in his team. He caught it during Episode #121 (A Sappy Ending), after helping its swarm against a rival swarm of Pinsir. Heracross is a powerful Pokémon, but it is often distracted by the sight of trees, going over to them to suck their sweet sap. When in the presence of Ash's Bulbasaur, Heracross tries to feed off Bulbasaur's bulb, much to the latter's frustration. Ash eventually left Heracross in the care of Professor Oak, where it has remained since. Ash however got it back to battle in the Johto League, in which it battled Gary's Magmar and won, but lost to Gary's next pokemon, Blastoise. He also got him back in episode 441- Fierce Fighting! Jungle Battle at the Battle Palace, in which it battled Spenser's Venusaur and also tried to suck the flower on Venusaur's back. However, Heracross lost that battle. 

Heracross is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in all adaptations of Pokémon.

In the trading card game.
Heracross, like many other Basic Pokémon with no evolutions, is not overwhelmingly represented in the card game. It has appeared in all the following sets, in all cases Grass-type unless otherwise noted:
Neo Genesis;
Neo Destiny;
Skyridge;
EX Hidden Legends;
EX Team Rocket Returns (Fighting/Ground type);
EX Dragon Frontiers (as Heracross  , Fire type);

Randol Doyle Choate, otherwise known as Randy Choate (born September 5, 1975 in San Antonio, Texas) is a professional baseball pitcher in the MLB for the Minnesota Twins.

High School Years.
Choate attended Winston Churchill High School (San Antonio, Texas) and was a letterman in baseball.

Pro career.
Choate made his debut on 1st July 2000, retiring the only batter he faced, in a 6-1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field. In his 22 games for the Yankees in this year, Randy had a record of 0-1 with a 4.76 ERA, after having his contract purchased by the Yankees from the Columbus Clippers of Triple-A. After a career best 3-1 with 3.35 ERA in 2001, Choate had a miserable 2002 and 2003, playing in just 23 games and a 6.23 ERA over this timespan.

Choate moved to the Montreal Expos, during the 2003/2004 offseason, but didn't get to play a game in the last-ever season for the Expos, as the Arizona Diamondbacks acquired him in a trade on 27th March, that sent Arizona pitcher John Patterson back to Le Stade Olympique. Choate appeared in nearly every second game for the D-Backs, playing 74 games (the most number of games by a left-handed pitcher in Diamondbacks history and the 4th highest in total franchise history), achieving a 2-4 record with a 4.62 ERA.

But, 2005 & 2006 have been very lean years for Randy, as he has only played 38 games (as of September 28, 2006). However, Choate played a vast majority of the 2006 season with Arizona's Triple-A affiliate, the Tucson Sidewinders, playing a key role in the bullpen, by helping them win the Pacific Coast League championship.

Choate was recently designated for assignment and removed from the Diamondbacks' 40-man roster.

Trivia.
 In Choate's career, he has only given up 5 home runs in 165 innings pitched.

He was the founder of Sindh Awami Mahaz - which went on to be the National Awami Party (National Peoples Party) Along with Ibrahim Joyo G.M. Syed blended Sindhi nationalism with Communism and Sufism through the ideas of Gandhi and Marx.

He was born at the village Sann in Dadu District, Sindh, on January 17 1904 in British India (Pakistan) and died in 1995. His father died when he was only sixteen months old. He has had no formal schooling. Whatever he learnt, was self-tutored. By dint of hard work, he attained mastery over Sindhi and English languages. He was also conversant with Arabic and Persian languages. History, Philosophy and Political science were his favorite subjects of study. 

At an early age of fourteen years, he started his career as an activist. 

In 1919 he became Chairman of School Board of his own Tahsil. 

Subsequently, he was elected as a President of Karachi District Local Board in 1929. He later became its President.

In 1941, he became one of the members of the Central Committee of the Muslim League. 

In 1943, he became President of Sindh Muslim League. 

In 1944, he played a pivotal role in politics and got a resolution passed in the Sindh Assembly in favor of Pakistan, which was the pioneer resolution of its kind in the whole of undivided India.

Mr. Syed is the author of more than sixty five (65) books. His books are on numerous subjects, ranging from literature to politics, religion and culture etc. He was himself a mystic had a lot of love and regard for mystics of all faiths. Besides being a man of immense learning, Mr. Syed possesses a personality that was graceful and poised. Highly cultured and refined manners, hospitality and geniality were the two glaring traits of his character. Wit and humor were the keynotes of his personality. He respected all genuine difference of opinions. For decades, Sindh and Sindhi people had constituted the center of his interest and activity, and all his love energies were devoted to their good. 

GM Syed proposed the Pakistan Resolution, 1940 in the Sindh Assembly, which ultimately resulted in the creation of Pakistan. However, he became the first political prisoner of Pakistan because of his differences with the leadership of the country, as he believed that they had deceived the Sindhis. 

In 1971, disappointed with the national politics of Pakistan, GM Syed found no option but to demand the Right of Self Determination for the people of Sindh. In 1973 he founded the 'Jeay Sindh' movement which is aimed at establishing an independent Sindhi state ('Sindhu Desh'). For his bold expression of opinion and views after the creation of Pakistan, he has been kept either in jail-or in solitary confinement for the: period of more than 30 years. 

On 19 January 1992, GM Syed was put under house arrest and his house was declared a sub-jail. He has been detained without trial until his death and has been adopted "Prisoner of Conscience" by Amnesty International (ASA 33/WU02/94).

<doc id="6882997" title="Sidi Bashir mosque" nonfiltered="800" processed="792" dbindex="1480806">

The Sidi Bashir mosque is located in the city of Ahmedabad in western India. Due to its unique construction, the mosque is also called Jhulta Minar or Shaking Minarets.

History.

It is believed that the mosque was constructed by Sidi Bashir, a slave of Sultan Ahmed Shah. A conflicting story is that the mosque was built by Malik Sarang, a noble in the court of Muhammed Begada, another Sultan of Gujarat. The mosque was completed in 1452.

Minarets.

There are two minarets in the mosque, each of which is three stories tall with carved balconies. A gentle shaking of either minaret results in the other minaret vibrating after a few seconds, though the connecting passage between them remains free of vibration. The actual cause of this is unknown as of yet. This phenomenon was first observed in the 19th century by Monier M. Williams, an English Sanskrit scholar. 

Other shaking minarets.

Another mosque in Ahmedabad called the Raj Bibi mosque also had shaking minarets similar to the ones at the Sidi Bashir mosque. But the British dismantled one of the minarets in order to study the construction. The minaret could not be put back together.

There is also one in Isfahan, Iran called Minar Jonban (shaking minarets) with almost the same properties.

Present condition.

The mosque is located opposite the Ahmedabad Railway station and is one of the most popular tourist destinations of Ahmedabad. Entry to the shaking minaret was prohibited following an incident at Qutb Minar in Delhi, where a stampede resulted in many children being crushed.

Field craft is a term used especially in British military circles to describe the basic military skills required to operate stealthily at day or night regardless of weather or terrain. 


These skills include camouflage, understanding the difference between concealment from view and cover from fire, use of the shape of the ground and its features to move undetected, the skills of moving across ground and crossing obstacles, the ability to select good fire positions, lying up positions, camping positions and the like, the ability to observe effectively, penetrating camouflage, and the ability to detect where enemy fire is coming from using a number of techniques.

Good field craft is especially important for the survival and effectiveness of infantry soldiers and special forces and in the more effective units a huge amount of attention to detail as well as much time and effort is devoted to making good field craft second nature.






Field Craft is also used in espionage to cover thing such as blind passes, dead drops, and other ways of passing documents, or other items between agents.

<doc id="303841" title="Shih Tzu" nonfiltered="805" processed="797" dbindex="1480811">





The Shih Tzu  and Imperial Shih Tzu (pronounced Sheet zoo in singular and plural) (    pinyin: Sh zi G u, Wade-Giles: Shih-tzu Kou) is a dog breed which originated in China.  The spelling "Shih Tzu", most commonly used for the breed, is according to the Wade-Giles system of romanization. The Shih Tzu is reported to be the oldest and smallest of the Tibetan holy dogs, its lion-like look being associated with the Snowlion. It is now often called by a homonymic name, "xi shi quan" (   ), based on the name of Xi Shi, regarded as the most beautiful woman of ancient China.
The Shih Tzu  and The Imperial Shih Tzu is known to be a companion dog with great charm. 

Appearance.  	 
The Shih Tzu breed and The Imperial Shih Tzu  ,or lion dog  is characterized by its long flowing double coat; sturdy build; intelligence; and a friendly, lively attitude.  In breeding all coat colors are allowed.  The Shih Tzu's hair can be styled either in a short summer cut, or kept long as is compulsory for conformation shows.  They are reputed to be a hypoallergenic pet.  Although owners do not generally find hair on furniture or clothes, Shih Tzu's do shed small amounts. 


The AKC Shih Tzu breed standard calls for the dog to have a short snout, large eyes, and a palm-like tail that waves above its torso. The ideal Standard Shih Tzu height at withers is 9 to 10 1/2 inches. The dog should stand no less than 8 inches and not more than 11 inches tall. The Shih Tzu should never be so high stationed as to appear leggy, nor so low stationed as to appear dumpy or squatty. Regardless of size or gender, the Shih Tzu should always be solid and compact, and carry good weight and substance.

The  Imperial Shih Tzu  Club  calls for  the Imperial  to  stay  under 9 pounds and  are  highly desired because of this weight  variation.  The Imperial Shih Tzu was  the  parent  of  the  Shih tzu and cherished by  Royalty and most  pet owners today   because  of the ease of  caring them  and are  called  the portable Imperial Shih Tzu.

James E. Mumford described the breed in an American Shih Tzu magazine, giving a picture of the versatile character of the Shih Tzu:	 
"Nobody knows how the Ancient Eunuchs managed to mix together And now here comes the recipe: A dash of lion, several teaspoons of rabbit, a couple of ounces of domestic cat, one part court jester, a dash of ballerina, a pinch of old man (Chinese), a bit of beggar, a tablespoon of monkey, one part baby seal, a dash of teddy bear and the rest dogs of Tibetan and Chinese origin."

Although generally outgoing and friendly, the Shih Tzu definitely has an attitude that cries to be spoiled. However, poorly bred dogs of the breed can be excitable, noisy, and snappy. Shih Tzus will almost literally do anything for food and look for any kind of chance to eat something other than just dog food. Though Shih Tzu are generally good with children, they become easily jealous of babies and toddlers. Poorly bred ones may snap if bothered by rambunctious children. Well-bred Shih Tzu are, as the Breed Standard calls for, affectionate to all people and should never show aggression to people or children. Because they are small, they can be injured by small children, and therefore are better suited for older children, particularly those who enjoy combing his hair.

Shih Tzus are intelligent, and can be trained for obedience competitions and for good manners around the home. They can be stubborn, so persistence and consistency are definite pluses in training methods. Punishment makes this dog shut down, so training should also be low-key and motivational.

Health.

The Shih Tzu or lion dog is a long lived and fairly healthy breed, but there are a few health conditions that are known to affect the dog. Health issues include entropion, portacaval shunt, renal dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), patellar luxation, and trichiasis. Shih Tzus typically live between 11 and 14 years.

History.

The Shih Tzu has been around for a long time. The Shih Tzu was bred to sit around the palace of the Emperor of China and bark when people or animals approached: this is allegedly to alert people to the presence of unwanted visitors. It is believed that this ornamental breed was created by breeding the Bei-jing gou (Pekingese) with a Tibetan dog breed, the Lhasa Apso. Recent DNA analysis confirms that this is one of the oldest breeds of dog. The Shih Tzu is also known as the Chinese/Tibetan Lion Dog or the Chrysanthemum Dog.It is called the chrysanthemum dog because it's face looks very much like the flower. In 1994, the Shih Tzu became the 12th most popular breed of dog in the AKC's 139 breeds with more than 37,000 new individuals.  

American and European Shih Tzu.
There are differences between the American and European Shih Tzu

La famille Plouffe was a Canadian television drama, more specifically a téléroman, about a Quebec family that first aired in the French-language on Société Radio-Canada in 1953.  The show was created to fill a void in francophone television in Canada. Whereas the English Canadian television branch of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation could broadcast English-language shows from American stations, the francophone component of the CBC, Radio-Canada had to develop its own programs for French-Canadian viewers from the earliest days of television in Canada.  This show was one of the few that helped to launch the téléroman genre of programming in French Canada, interestingly around the same time the first telenovelas aired in Latin America.

The series was also broadcast, dubbed into English as The Plouffe Family, on CBC Television the following year. 

The series was based on the novel Les Plouffe, by Roger Lemelin. It chronicled the daily life of a working class family in the years following World War II. The family included patriarch Théophile, a former provincial cycling champion who had settled into life as a plumber, his wife Joséphine, a naive but kind-hearted mother who doted on her adult children, and their children Napoléon, Ovide, Cécile and Guillaume.

<doc id="7009245" title="Smart Messaging" nonfiltered="808" processed="800" dbindex="1480814">

Introduction.
Smart Messaging is a specification designed by Nokia to allow low resolution Graphics/Pictures and monophonic ringtones to be sent to and between cellular phones by either a single or series of concatenated SMS text message(s).

Most Nokia phones support Smart Messaging to some degree, however, not all formats are available to all phones. Some other manufacturers now also support Smart Messaging to some degree or other.

Some of the more popular types of Smart Message are:
Graphical Smart Messages.
Picture Message.
A monchrome picture that can be sent between handsets as a series of SMS messages. The typical size of a picture message is 72x28 pixels, which is sent as three separate SMS messages.

Most Monochrome Nokia handsets allow the picture message to act as a screensaver. Most colour ones do not.

The Picture message uses an implementation of the OTA Bitmap.
           

Operator Logo.
A monchrome picture that can be sent to a handset via an SMS Gateway as either a single or a series of concatenated SMS messages. The typical size of an Operator Logo is 72x14 pixels, which is sent as two separate SMS messages.

Operator Logos sit in the middle of the screen and disappear when coverage is lost. The original intent of Operator Logos was to allow a Network Operator or MVNO to replace the name of their network (as stored on the SIM card with their graphical logo, but human nature being what it is, people now usually get one that represents them rather than their network.

There is a workaround that allows a standard size Operator Logo to be sent as a single message, however, compatibility with newer or non-Nokia phones is uncertain. A more accurate way of reducing the cost of sending Operator Logos is to reduce their size to 72x13 pixels. This size would be sent as a single message.

The Operator Logo uses an implementation of the OTA Bitmap.

CLI Icon / Group Logo.
A monchrome picture that can be sent to a handset via an SMS Gateway as either a single or a series of concatenated SMS messages. The typical size of a picture message is 72x14 pixels, which is sent as a single separate SMS message.

A CLI Icon is a picture that will display on the handset when a call is received from someone who's number is stored in the handset as part of the corresponding 'group' (eg friends, colleagues, clients etc).

The CLI Icon uses an implementation of the OTA Bitmap.

Internal Structure of a Smart Message.
The content of each Smart Message sent is divided into two parts. The 'Data Header' and the 'Data Content'.

The Data Header.

The Data header is again divided into two parts, the first part is exceptionally small, only one byte in length, and defines the total length of the header.

After this there are one or more 'Information Elements', these tell the phone what to do with the information when it receives it. The two most common Information Elements are for Port Number Addressing (code 05) and concatenation (code 00) (telling the phone how to put together two or more SMS messages to make a single message).

The first byte of the Information Element Identifies what information is to follow. It is called the 'Information Element Identifier' or IEI.

The second byte of the Information Element is the 'Information Element Data Length' or IEDL. It tells the phone how many of the following bytes are part of the Information Identifier.

The third and subseqent bytes of the the Information Element are the actual information being conveyed. This is called the IED or Information Element Data.

A valid example of a Smart Message Header, expressed in hex is 0B0504158200000003010201.

This means:
   0B         0B is hex for 11. There are 11 more bytes to follow.
     05       This is the code for port addressing.
      04      The next 4 bytes of data belong to this Information Element
       15 82  Send it to Port 1582 (in other words, it is an Operator Logo)
       00 00  It was sent from Port 0000. This is not relevant for most Smart Message types, but must be included nonetheless
     00       This is the code for Concatenation. This content is being sent as multiple SMS messages
      03      Three more bytes of information belong to this Information Element.
       01     Message Reference No. If two or more items are being sent, giving them different reference numbers makes sure the phone knows which SMS messages belong to which Smart Message.
       02     Overall, there are two messages.
       01     This is the first message in the sequence.


The Data Content.

The Data Content varies depending on the type of Smart Message. With Graphical types, it contains the OTA Bitmap, and sometimes other information such as the Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code. For ringtones, it contains the music etc.

An outside flame ignitor was an early ignition device used in internal-combustion engines that used a flame outside the engine and a sliding port on the cylinder head. At the appropriate time in the compression cycle of the engine, the port would briefly be opened and closed allowing the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder to be ignited by the flame.

They had many problems, including partial loss of compression through the port when it opened and many mechanical problems with the mechanism that operated the port.

They were considered obsolete before 1911.

<doc id="55684" title="Child time-out" nonfiltered="810" processed="802" dbindex="1480816">
A time-out is an educational (mainly parenting) technique recommended by many pediatrists and developmental psychologists as an alternative to spanking and other traditional forms of discipline. In brief, the idea is to keep the child isolated for a limited period of time, intended to allow it to calm down, learn coping skills and discourage inappropriate behavior. 
It is also a time for parents to separate feelings of anger toward the child for their behavior and develop a plan for discipline.

 Applying the technique .
The technique is recommended mostly for toddlers and upwards. For an older child, the parent is advised to explain what kind of misbehavior will result in a time-out and also write down those rules. When implementing the time-out, it is suggested that no arguing should be allowed -- that may work counter to the idea behind the time-out, which is to allow the child to calm down. Time-outs are not recommended for frequent use (if it works, improved behavior should make it less necessary), but since they are considered a mild form of discipline they are not always used as a last resort.

The following guidelines are usually given for time-outs:

Decide what type of behavior warrants a time-out (such as fighting, arguing or throwing tantrums), and try to enforce this fairly and consistently. All adults involved with the child should follow similar guidelines when using a time-out.
Designate a corner (hence the common term corner time) or similar space where the child is to stand during time-outs. Never use their bed.
Use an age appropriate time length for the time-out. For a short time-out, approximately one minute per year of age is reasonable; that time may be doubled if necessary if the child pushes their limits during the time-out.
Have an incentive for completing the time-out without arguing. This may for instance be a loss of a privilege until the time-out has been completed. ;
The time-out should always have verbal warnings before the discipline to allow the child to make appropriate choices. If their bad behavior continues, they should have an explanation for the time-out as they are being escorted to that area. Even one-year olds understand when they have reached their parental limit, but the explanations should be age appropriate.
Afterwards both the parent and the child should try to leave the incident behind.

Another outline, which is better suited to the classroom, says:
Announce the guidelines to the children periodically. Explain what a timeout is, and demonstrate how it begins and ends.
When a child misbehaves, approach it saying, "Time out for X" (where X is the forbidden act, e.g., teasing).
Send or bring the child to the time-out place. (Within earshot of the teacher is best.);
When time's up, go over to the child and say, "Why did you have time-out?" The ideal answer is, "For X" (e.g., "Because I teased Sally.") If they don't seem to know why they got time out, remind them (briefly).
After they are let out of the area, they are to apologize to the victim if there is one.

While some proponents of time-outs insist on silence and stillness from the child during the time-out, others insist that the time-out should allow the child to get anger and frustration out of their system. 

Some of those in favor of spanking have argued that time-outs are ineffective. Others argue that it should be seen as a complement rather than as an alternative to spanking; a spanking may be preceded and/or followed by a time-out 'to think about what you did'; some individual often order time-out to be spent divested as during spanking, even exposing the reddened bare bottom afterwards, with the hope of making the punishment more humiliating.
As discipline means to teach, no disciplinary technique should be used without the child understanding why the behavior was unacceptable and what behavior is expected.

Notes.
This time-out is also used in schools and should not be confused with a time-out as awarded in team sports (where it is often considered a calculated risk).

 Counting to Three .
One form of this is counting to three as a way to get children to listen to parents the first time. When a child is doing something wrong you say, "That's One". Then wait five seconds. If they are still doing the unacceptable behavior say, "That's Two". Wait five more seconds and say "That's Three, Take Five" or "That's Three, Time Out". Then you put them in time out. 

Time out can be their room, a naughty chair or another spot you have designated for this purpose. They stay there for five minutes, or less if they are under 5 years old. When their time is up and they have calmed down they can come out of the time out area.

<doc id="2961909" title="British police strikes in 1918 and 1919" nonfiltered="812" processed="804" dbindex="1480818">





The Police Strikes of 1918 and 1919 resulted in the British Government putting before Parliament its proposals for the Police Bill, which established the Police Federation as the representative body for the police. The Bill also barred policemen from belonging to a union or affiliating with any trade body outside of the new Police Federation. This Bill, drafted and passed into law, was as a direct response to the emergence of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers (NUPPO). Their successful strike of 1918, and their threatened strike in June 1919 made it even more imperative to the Government to suppress this union, the position of which was only ever unofficial. Hence on 1 August 1919 the Police Act 1919 passed into law. Only token opposition from a minority of Labour MPs was voiced in Parliament.

Preliminaries.

In 1870 it is recorded that police in Newcastle-on-Tyne were 'in dispute' with their local Watch Committee over conditions of work and low pay, though there was no withdrawal from duty. Two years later in 1872, 179 men of the Metropolitan Police refused to report for duty. Their refusal was over the poor conditions of their service and low pay the same as those in Newcastle-on-Tyne. The policemen that refused duty were back on the beat in a matter of hours. Of the 179 men that refused duty sixty-nine were dismissed from the force the rest were, after apologising for their conduct, were allowed back on duty. The end result was an improvement in the pay and conditions. What was significant about this action was that a precedent had been set, direct action could bring results.

However successful this stoppage was in 1872 it did not lead to a union being formed. Indeed the most of the policemen involved in this stoppage would not have considered forming a union. The act of withdrawing from duty was considered as an act of mutiny, which reflects the quasi-military nature of the police. Despite the dismissals in the strike of 1872 members of the Metropolitan Force took part in a further stoppage in July 1890; this time the cause was police pensions. The Government argued that it could not be held to ransom, yet as an illustration of how seriously the Government took the loyalty of the police the Police Pensions Bill (1890) was drafted and rushed through Parliament in a matter of weeks.

The Crime Act.
The Crime Act (1885) had made it illegal for anyone to interfere with a policeman in the course of his duty. Thus anyone calling on a policeman to stop work or support a fellow worker would be guilty of a criminal offence. This slowed down the formation of a union: but did not stop it. The September 1913 issue of the Police Review carried an anonymous letter informing its readers that a union was being formed. Thus in secret policemen began to do the unthinkable and join a union. It had to be done in secret simply because anyone found to be a member was instantly dismissed from the force. However, the fledgling union did strike a cord of appeal and membership grew. On the eve of the strike in 1918 the NUPPO were able to claim a membership of 10000 policemen: the force strength of the Metropolitan Police numbered only 12000. The establishment of a union amongst the police caused the Commissioner Sir Edward Henry to issue an official police order banning the union and promising instant dismissal to anyone found to be associated with it. The Government also took a hostile stance with regard to the police to having a union. The Home Secretary and the Commissioner assumed that the threat of dismissal from the force and loss of pension rights was an adequate deterrent. Nevertheless, by the August of 1918 the mood of the men was so totally misread that the Metropolitan Police went on strike. Leaving London , the capital, to the mercy of the mob.

Dismissal of Police Captain Theil.
The dismissal of Police Captain Theil, a union member of some prominence was the incident that actually sparked the 1918 strike. He was dismissed on the grounds of his union activities. However, this was only a spark for all the grievances over pay and conditions. The authorities grossly under estimated the strength of support amongst the rank and file for positive action to further their own grievances, and to defend Constable Theil. The day before the strike began Police Superintendents reported at their weekly meeting with the Commissioner that all was quiet in the force.

The Strike of 1918.

The Executive of the NUPPO claimed a rise in pay, improved war bonuses, extension of pension rights to include policemen's widows and a shortening of the pension entitlement period. An allowance for children of school age was demanded. However, the most important point on the table was the official recognition of the NUPPO as the police union. Furthermore, they informed the Authorities that unless their demands were met by midnight on the 29th of August they would call a strike. The strike of 1918 caught the Government off balance at a time of increasing unrest on the domestic scene and internationally at a very precarious period.

The results.

The swiftness of the strike and the solidarity of the men shocked the Government. By the next day, August 30th, 12000 men, which was virtually the whole complement of men in the Metropolitan Force, were on strike. By the morning of the 30th troops had been deployed at key points across the capital. The first imperative of the Government was to get the police back on duty. On the 31st. Lloyd George, who had been in France when the strike started, called a meeting with the Executive of the NUPPO. By the end of the afternoon the strike had been settled. All ranks were to receive an increase of 13 shillings  per week in pensionable pay taking the minimum to 43 shillings . The right to a pension was reduced from thirty years service to twenty-six years service and widows were 
awarded a pension of 10 shillings . A war bonus of 12 shillings  per week was granted and a grant of 2 shillings and sixpence p for each child of school age was given. Constable Theil was reinstated. All the demands of the NUPPO had been met, except official recognition of the union. In the provinces there had been no strikes. Nevertheless policemen in Manchester threatened to strike: they were offered and accepted the same terms given to the Metropolitan Police. By October, several other police forces around the country had been given pay increases. An immediate consequence of the strike was the increase in union membership it jumped from 10000 in August to 50000 by the November of 1918.

As far as union recognition was concerned the Prime Minister, Lloyd George, had said that this could not be granted in time of war. The fact that Lloyd George had met, and settled the dispute, with the union leaders was viewed by James Marston the union President as de facto recognition of the union. The Government, by granting the demands made on pay and conditions, implied the promise of union recognition.

As a consequence of the 1918 strike Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned: his replacement was General Sir Nevil Macready a serving soldier. He immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police. As far as Macready was concerned the days of the NUPPO were numbered. He had the comforting knowledge that given the circumstances in which his appointment was made he was to have Carte Blanche in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston the President and Jack Hayes the General Secretary of NUPPO. As far as Macready was concerned the police had, had a grievance, which was now settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with.

In an attempt to circumnavigate the union Macready established Representative Broads for Police officers. By instituting the boards Macready had neither consulted the Government or the Union . The Boards would consist of one delegate from each of the twenty-six divisions within the Metropolitan force all of whom were to be elected by secret ballot. The NUPPO executive demanded once again that the NUPPO be officially recognised. With the approval of the Home Office Macready lifted the ban in Police Orders that barred policemen joining the NUPPO; with the addendum that membership of the union should not interfere with police discipline, or implore policemen to withdraw from duty.

The Government announced that a committee be convened under Lord Desborough that would look at all aspects police forces of England, Wales and Scotland. One of the things it highlighted was the inconsistency in police pay. At the time there was no uniform pay structure for the police. Local Watch Committees were the sole arbiters of police pay. The pay of agricultural workers and unskilled labourers had out stripped that of the police. The Desborough Committee recorded that the pay for the average constable serving in a provincial force with five years service who was married with to children would earn 2 pounds 15 shillings , and this included all their allowances, which included rent and a child allowance. The Desborough Committee cited examples that a street sweeper in Newcastle-on-Tyne was on the same rate of pay as a constable in the provincial force. All the rest of the examples, of which there were ten, were paid more. Six of those were higher than the pay of the Metropolitan Police. Therefore, in respect of pay and conditions Lord Desborough was quite sympathetic to the plight of the ordinary policeman. So the pay awards recommended by his committee were quite generous for their day.

By the end of 1918 and into 1919 it seemed that all the unions, large and small, were active in disputes the length and breath of Britain . By mid 1919 there were strikes or the threat of strikes in the docks, the railways and the transport workers. There was a nation wide bakers strike, in Glasgow there was a rent strike by council tenants. In the press there were claims that Bolshevik revolution had arrived in Britain . The Government could not afford the possibility of the police aligning themselves with another union or the TUC. Police loyalty in such a dangerous time was paramount, and the Government was determined that it would not be caught napping a second time.

The Police Bill 1919 was the final piece of legislation the put and end to NUPPO. The Police Bill established the Police Federation to replace the NUPPO. Under the Bills provision NUPPO was outlawed as a representative body for the police. Furthermore the police were forbidden by law from belonging to a trade union. The reaction of the NUPPO was predictable; it was bound to be, considering the content of the Bill. The union had no option but to fight. However, this time it was the union that was to misread the mood of the men: they called for a strike. Out of a force of 18200 men in the Metropolitan Police only 1156 men went on strike.

The tale in Liverpool was a different one however Liverpool City Police supported the strike. In 1919 the complement of the Liverpool City Police was 1874 men of these 954 went on strike. The grievances of policemen in Liverpool were for many years ignored by a local Watch Committee which was noted for it disciplinarian attitude, which helped to fostered the mood for action. The poor conditions in the Liverpool Police were almost legendary amongst other forces in England . On the day the strike started in Liverpool striking policemen formed into ranks and decided to march on police stations around the city in an attempt to persuade those no on strike to join them. Firstly, the police strikers who found themselves coming to blows with fellow officers that had not joined the strike: some of who were union members.

The consequences for the people of Liverpool however were far greater than those in the capital. Left without an affective Police presence public order in some of the working-class areas of Liverpool broke down, and the locals went on a spree of looting and vandalism. This orgy of looting continued for around three or four days before the military aided by non-striking policemen brought the situation under control: at the cost of several lives and more than two hundred arrests for looting. The final outcome of the strike was that every man who had gone on strike, right across the country, was dismissed from their respective forces. Not one striker was reinstated anywhere, and all lost their pension entitlements.

The eventual outcome of the strikes of 1918 and 1919 were beneficial to policemen. Firstly, the police received an increase in pay that doubled their wages. More than this however was that the Government were force to take notice of the police, and their grievances, and in doing so established the Police Federation. Importantly the two strikes by the police had also made the government realise the importance of the police in terms of their own stability. After 1919 the police were never again taken quite as for granted, as they had been prior to 1918.

In architecture, a boss is a knob or protrusion of stone or wood, usually used in the ceilings of buildings, particularly at the intersection of a vault. 

In Gothic architecture, such roof bosses (or ceiling bosses) were often intricately carved with foliage, heraldic devices or other decorations. Many feature animals, birds, or human figures or faces, sometimes realistic, but often grotesque: the Green Man is a frequent subject.

KTFQ-TV channel 14 is a television station in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It runs a Spanish Entertainment format consisting of Spanish comedy shows, Spanish dramas, Spanish movies, and Spanish kids' shows. They run programming from TeleFutura the second network owned by Univision. The station however is owned by Entravision which also owns two other stations in Albuquerque: Univisión affiliate KLUZ and Home Shopping Network affiliate KTFA-LP.

History.
Channel 14 signed on as  KGSW-TV May 8, 1981. The callsign then was derived from the station's original owners, Galaxy Communications and Southwest Television. Initially the station on channel 14 carried drama shows, movies from the 40's through the 70's, sitcoms, and religious shows. In the Fall of 1983 KGSW added more sitcoms and began running cartoons in the 7-9 a.m. and the 3-5 p.m. weekday slots.

In 1984, the Providence Journal Company bought KGSW from the original owners. The station affiliated with the Fox network when the network launched on October 9, 1986. The station continued a general entertainment format with a lot of cartoons, sitcoms, and movies.

In the early fall of 1992 when Channel 2 KKTO went dark Providence Journal immediately folded Channel 2's programming into Channel 14's lineup. Shortly after they would buy the license of Channel 2 as well and on April 5, 1993 KGSW FOX14 would move to Channel 2 and would change call letters to KASA. The Channel 14 license was then turned into the FCC.

In 1997 Paxson Communications was awarded the Channel 14 license and in 1998 signed on as KAPX with infomercials during the day and Worship music on overnights. In the early Fall of 1998 they ran a brand new network known as Pax TV with a lot of Family entertainment shows. Originally Pax aired from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. but eventually pulled back to 4 to 11 p.m. and later 5 to 11 p.m.. This was due to financial problems at Paxson.

Another result of financial problems was that Paxson opted to sell some of its stations. They opted to sell 14 KAPX in 2003 to Entravision which already owned Univision affiliate Channel 41. Pax TV moved to cable only in the Albuquerque market. Channel 14 became KTFQ and took the Telefutura Spanish Network.

Rabbi Elyah Lopian (1872-1970)  was among the most prominent rabbis of the Mussar movement.

Lopian was born in Kelm  and immigrated to the Land of Israel after the Holocaust. He was known as a Rabbinical scholar with extensive knowledge of the Talmud and grew famous mostly for his contributions to Mussar.

Upon making Aliyah, he initially refused to lead Mussar seminars and sought to occupy himself with teaching and private moral work.  With the blessing of Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz (the "Chazon Ish"), he finally reconciled himself with leading Mussar courses.  Despite his old age, he agreed in the end to act as Mashgiach at the Knesset Hazakyahu Yeshiva (located originally in Zikhron Ya'aqov and then moved to Kfar Hasidim), headed by Rabbi Noah Shimonovitz. From the moment of his arrival, Rabbi Lopian became a magnet for the young men.  The yeshiva became firmly established and even drew many young people from neighboring Yeshiva high schools such as the Bnei Akiva Kfar HaRo'eh yeshivah and Midrashiat Naam in Pardes Hannah.

As a disciple of the Kelm Talmud Torah method, he was known for his strict keeping of order and strong self-control.   It is told that he would not turn his head without a reason and a structured decision.

After his death, a street was named in his honor in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood of Jerusalem.

<doc id="664030" title="Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme" nonfiltered="817" processed="809" dbindex="1480823">
The Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) is the governing body of motorcycle racing. It represents 90 national motorcycle federations that are divided into six regional continental unions.

There are five motorcycle-racing disciplines that FIM covers, encompassing 34 world championships and prizes: road racing, motocross, trials, enduro, and track racing (combining Grass Track and Speedway). FIM is also involved in many non-racing activities that promote the sport, its safety, and support relevant public policy.

History.

The FIM was born from the Fédération Internationale des Clubs Motocyclistes (FICM), which itself was founded in Paris, France on December 21, 1904. The British Auto-Cycle Union (ACU) was one of the founding members. In 1906, the FICM was dissolved, but reborn in 1912 with the headquarters now located in England. The Six Days Reliabilty Trial was held the next year, the first international event held by the new incarnation.

The name was changed to the Fédération Internationale Motocycliste (FIM) in 1949, the same year that also saw the first race of the famed Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix. The headquarters were transferred to Geneva, Switzerland in 1959.

1994 saw the headquarters relocated once again, this time to Mies, Switzerland, and occupy its own building for the first time, shaped like a stylized motorcycle. The name was changed again in 1998 to the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) at the congress in Cape Town, South Africa. The same year, the FIM was given provisional status of recognition by the International Olympic Committee, and gained full status in 2000 at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

2004 marked the centenary and celebrations were held at the congress in Paris in October.

<doc id="18544" title="Left-arm unorthodox spin" nonfiltered="819" processed="811" dbindex="1480825">


In cricket, left-arm unorthodox spin   often known as slow left-arm chinaman and abbreviated to SLC   is a style of bowling.  The bowler uses a wrist torsion action to spin the ball so that when it pitches it turns from off to leg for a right-handed batsman, i.e. from left to right from the bowler's perspective. The action and direction of turn exactly mirror those of a conventional right-handed leg spin bowler. Charlie 'Buck' Llewellyn, a South African all-rounder who played at the end of the 19th century, laid claim to inventing the delivery. Some chinaman bowlers occasionally bowl the mirror image of a leg-spinner's "googly" (or "wrong'un" in Australia), which turns in the opposite way in order to trick the batsman. In this instance the ball turns away from the batsman, as if the bowler were an orthodox left-arm spinner.

The chinaman style of bowling is very rare, as not only is it difficult to bowl accurately (in common with leg spin), but the turn into the right-handed batsman is seen as less dangerous than the turn away from the batsman generated by an orthodox left-arm spinner, so virtually all left-armers choose to bowl orthodox.  Very few specialist chinaman bowlers have played at Test level. The South African Paul Adams, well known for his unusual "frog-in-a-blender" bowling action, is perhaps the best known recent practitioner and has taken more Test wickets through chinaman bowling than any other player. The Australian Brad Hogg is the most successful ODI chinaman bowler, with over 100 wickets, but he does not regularly play in Tests. The young chinaman bowler Dave Mohammed of the West Indies has also played sporadically for his country since 2004. In recent times, Simon Katich and before him Michael Bevan have also bowled chinamen for Australia, although this role was secondary to their batting.  

Historically the most famous practitioner of the art was the West Indian all-rounder Garfield Sobers, but he performed it as a third bowling style after left-arm orthodox spin and left-arm fast-medium.  Previously, Johnny Wardle bowled both chinamen and orthodox left-arm spinners for England in the 1940s and '50s, and Leslie "Chuck" Fleetwood-Smith bowled chinamen for Australia in the 1930s.

Origin of the term "chinaman".
The term "chinaman" to describe this particular style of bowling is of uncertain origin, and Wisden has at different times given two explanations. 

In one version, the term is believed to relate to former West Indian spin bowler Ellis "Puss" Achong. in the 1933 Old Trafford Test match, Achong, a left-arm orthodox spinner and the first Test cricketer of Chinese ancestry, bowled an unexpected wrist-spin delivery turning from off to leg, and had the English batsman Walter Robins stumped by Ivan Barrow as a result. Legend has it that Robins, as he walked back to the pavilion, remarked "Fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman". The 1987 obituary of Achong in Wisden says that the dismissal of Robins gave the term currency in England.

But the 1968 Wisden obituary of Maurice Leyland has the following: "According to Bill Bowes, Maurice claimed he was responsible for the term 'Chinaman'. Because his chances of bowling were few, he began bowling the occasional left-hander's off-break instead of the normal and natural leg-break. Whenever two batsmen were difficult to shift or something different was wanted someone in the Yorkshire team would say, 'Put on Maurice to bowl some of those Chinese things'. Roy Kilner explained, 'It's foreign stuff and you can't call it anything else'." The plausibility of this explanation is perhaps compromised by the fact that when Kilner died Leyland had taken only 11 wickets in eight first-class seasons (no more than four in any single season)   he didn't really get going as a bowler until 1928, and it was probably Kilner's death in April that year just before the start of the season in England that opened up greater possibilities for Leyland to bowl than he had had before.

The Wallowa River is a tributary of the Grande Ronde River, approximately 30 miles (48 km) long, in northeastern Oregon in the United States. It drains a valley on the Columbia Plateau in the northeast corner of the state north of Wallowa Mountains. It rises in southern Wallowa County, in the Wallowa Mountains in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. It flows generally northwest through the Wallowa Valley, past the communities of Joseph, Enterprise, and Wallowa. It receives the Minam River from the south at the hamlet of Minam, then flows north another 10 miles (16 km) to join the Grande Ronde along the Wallowa-Union county line approximately 10 miles (16 km) NNE of Elgin.

The Wallowa Valley was home to Chief Joseph's band of the Nez Percé, from which they were expelled in 1877.

Alfred Werner (December 12, 1866 - November 15, 1919) was a German chemist who was a professor at the University of Zurich. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1913 for proposing the octahedral configuration of transition metal complexes. Werner developed the basis for modern coordination chemistry. He also discovered hexol.

Octet rule.
In 1893, Werner showed that the number of atoms or groups associated with a central atom is often 4 or 6, the  co-ordination number  in which other coordination numbers up to a maximum of 8 occur, but less often.  On these views, and other similar views, in 1904 Richard Abegg formulated what is now known as Abegg's rule which states that that the difference between the maximum positive and negative valence of an element is frequently eight.  This rule was used later in 1916 when Gilbert Lewis formulated the  octet rule  in his cubical atom theory.

<doc id="2366591" title="Caponiidae" nonfiltered="822" processed="814" dbindex="1480828">

Spiders of the ecribellate haplogyne family Caponiidae are unusual in that most species have only two eyes, which is unheard of in other spiders. Other species have four, six or eight eyes. Even in a single species, sometimes the number of eyes changes from spiderling to adult.

Description.
These spiders of about 2 to 5mm are rarely noticed, but generally look like somewhat faded woodlouse hunter spiders in the genus Dysdera.  The carapace (cephalothorax or prosoma) is orange and the abdomen (opisthosoma) light gray. 
The two-eyed species have their two eyes in the anterior middle of the carapace.

Eye numbers.
 Eight eyes: Calponia, Caponia;
 Six eyes: Caponina (but may also have two, three, four or five eyes);
 Four eyes: Nopsides, Notnops;
 Two eyes: Nops, Orthonops, Diplogena, Taintnops, Tisentnops;

Habits.
Their habits are for the most part unknown. At least some species are known to hunt other spiders.

Relationships.
The fact that they are ecribellate and haplogyne indicates that they are probably relatively primitive. Calponia harrisonfordi from California seems to be the most primitive member of the family. Their phylogenetic relationships have long been enigmatic, but in the early 1990s it was determined that they are probably a sister group of the Tetrablemmidae plus the four families inside the Dysderoidea superfamily.

The subfamily Nopinae consists at least of the genera Nops, Nopsides, Orthonops and Tarsonops. The remaining genera are unlikely to form a monophyletic group.

Distribution.
The family can be found in Africa and America from Argentina to the USA.

Names.
Calponia is a contraction of Californian Caponia, because the single species Calponia harrisonfordi has, like the African genus Caponia eight eyes. The species name is in honor of Harrison Ford, recognizing his efforts on behalf of the American Museum.

The Chilean caponiid fauna differs from that of the rest of the Neotropics in lacking members of the Nopinae (named after the genus Nops). Three genera newly described by Norman I. Platnick in 1994 were thus named Notnops, Taintnops and Tisentnops, emphasizing this fact. The only Taintnops species, T. goloboffi, is named in honor of one of the collectors, P.A. Goloboff.

Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel (May 1, 1285   November 17, 1326) was an English nobleman prominent in the contention between Edward II and his barons and second de facto Earl of the FitzAlan line.  He was born 1 May 1285 in the Castle of  Marlborough.  He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel and Alisia de Saluzzo (also known as Alice), daughter of Thomas I, marquis of Saluzzo in Italy. He succeeded to his father's estates and titles in 1302.  He was summoned to Parliament, 9 November 1306, as Earl of Arundel, and took part in the Scottish wars of that year.

Arundel bore the royal robes at Edward II's coronation, but he soon fell out with the king's favorite Piers Gaveston. In 1310 he was one of the Lords Ordainer, and he was one of the 5 earls who allied in 1312 to oust de Gaveston. Arundel resisted reconciling with the King after de Gaveston's death, and in 1314 he along with some other earls refused to help the king's Scottish campaign, which contributed in part to the English defeat at Bannockburn.

A few years later Arundel allied with king Edward's new favorites, Hugh le Despenser and his son of the same name, and had his son and heir Richard married to a daughter of the younger Hugh le Despenser. He reluctantly consented to the Despenser's banishment in 1321, and joined the king's efforts to restore them in 1321. Over the following years Arundel was one of the king's principal supporters, and after the capture of Roger Mortimer in 1322 he received a large part of the forfeited Mortimer estates. He also held the two great offices governing Wales, becoming justice of Wales in 1322 and warden of the Welsh marches in 1325.

After Mortimer's escape from prison and invasion of England in 1326, amongst the barons only Arundel and his brother-in-law Warenne remained loyal to the king. Their defensive efforts were ineffective, and Arundel was captured and executed at the behest of Queen Isabella.

Arundel married Alice Warenne, sister and eventual heiress of John de Warenne, 8th Earl of Surrey or Warenne and daughter of William de Warenne and Joan de Vere.  Alice was living in 1330 but died before 23 May 1338.  His estates and titles were forfeited when was executed, but they were eventually restored to his eldest son Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel.

Ravenous Records, a division of Ravenous Entertainment, was formed in 1998 by Jim Steinman and Steven Rinkoff. Rinkoff best explained the purpose of the label (and how it went wrong) in a May 2005 interview with BroadwayWorld.com, "Jim and I have a label called Ravenous Records where initially the idea was just to find great singers for Jim's songs, and as hard as that could be, we somehow got skewed into finding people that were writing their own songs, and then we became a label where we were putting out artists that had nothing to do with Jim's music."

Nicki French was signed to the label in 2000 during which time she recorded two tracks 'Lovers Again' (Bonnie Tyler cover) and 'Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad' (Meat Loaf cover),  both of which never got released comercially.

Currently, the label is pretty much inactive, but it is very active in the production of live events, such as the soon-to-be-released debut album by the The Dream Engine, containing songs mostly written by Steinman.  It is now owned by Sony BMG Music Entertainment.

<doc id="6041782" title="Saint John Stone" nonfiltered="828" processed="820" dbindex="1480834">
St John Stone was an English Reformation Augustinian friar, and Doctor of Sacred Theology, living in the Augustinian friary at Canterbury. The place where the Augustinian Friary once stood on St George's Street is still called Whitefriars.  Riceman's and Marks & Spencer's now stand where the friary once stood.

During the time of the Reformation Parliament, friar Stone publicly denounced the behaviour of King Henry VIII from the pulpit of the Austin Friars and publicly stated his approval of the status of monarch's first marriage - clearly opposing the monarch's wish to gain a divorce.   

On December 13, 1538, the civil powers of the British realm turn its attention to the outspoken friar. As a consequence of the Act of Supremacy, Bishop Richard Ingworth (a former Dominican, and by then Bishop of Dover) made a visitation to the Austin friary Canterbury as part of the process of the dissolution of monasteries in England. Ingworth commanded all of the Austin friars to  sign deed of surrender by which the King should gain possession of the friary and its surrounding property. They nearly all did, but John Stone refused to surrender church property to the civil state, and even further, he denounced bishop Ingworth for his compliance with the King's desires. John Stone was, in the end, executed at the Dane John(Dungeon Hill), Canterbury, for his opposition to the King's wishes.

"Behold I close my apostolate in my blood, In my death I shall find life, for  die for a holy cause, the defense of the Church of God, infallible and immaculate" he said as the executioners prepared to do their work. Stone was  hanged, drawn and quartered; his head and body placed on display to dishonour his corpse since he was considered a traitor for defying the king.

Subsequently, his name was placed at the top of the list of martyrs of the English Reformation which was presented to Rome for the process of beatification. St. John Stone was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886, and canonized by Pope Paul VI on October 25, 1970.

<doc id="4420675" title="Mariano Pernía" nonfiltered="829" processed="821" dbindex="1480835">

Mariano Andrés Pernía (born 4 May, 1977) is an Argentine-Spanish Football player.

Career Profile.
Early Years.
Pernía was born in Buenos Aires where he came through the ranks at San Lorenzo, although was never in the first team. Son of footballer Vicente Pernía (who was ironically left controversially out of the 1978 Argentina World Cup squad), he got his chance at professional football when he moved to Independiente, but found himself moving in and out of the first team. The beginning of 2003 saw his move to Spanish club Recreativo de Huelva, in the Spanish Segunda.

2004/05.
Although Pernía was 26 and yet to break into regular top-flight football, he made the most of his opportunity when he moved to newly promoted Spanish Primera side Getafe CF in 2004. Pernía made an immediate impact on La Liga as an offensive defender with a killer left foot. He scored three goals in his debut season with Getafe, including a 40-metre effort against Real Betis. He was a major part of the underrated Getafe side that survived their first season in La Liga, defying the expectations of several Football Pundits.

2005/06.
The 2006 season saw Pernía start 35 out of 38 games for Getafe in La Liga, and he finished the season with 10 goals and 2 assists, becoming the highest scoring defender in a season for 20 years. With such good form, Pernía s future was the source of much speculation. Despite a bid from Valencia, Pernía signed a four year contract with Atlético Madrid starting from 2006/2007, and will battle with fellow Spanish left-back Antonio López for that position. Unfortunately for Pernía, he was sent off in his last ever match for Getafe, in the final game of the season against Celta Vigo.

World Cup 2006.
Pernía s excellent form also made him a contender for international selection in Argentina and somewhat belatedly, Spain. Although born in Argentina, Pernía was granted Spanish Citizenship in May 2006. Luis Aragonés opted not to pick Pernia for the Spanish team to the World Cup - his reasoning was entirely legal and explained under current FIFA rules on squad selection. Asier del Horno remained the selected leftback for the World Cup. However, an ankle injury sustained by del Horno in the build-up to the tournament saw Pernía controversially called up as his replacement. In the last friendly match before the World Cup, Pernía made his debut against Croatia, and scored from a free-kick. Surprisingly, he replaced López as the starting left-back in group wins against Ukraine and Tunisia, and also in their Round of 16 loss to France.

<doc id="8636827" title="Snack Attack" nonfiltered="830" processed="822" dbindex="1480836">

Snack Attack is a 1982 computer game for the Apple II family of computers, created by Dan Illowsky and published by Datamost.

Gameplay.
Snack Attack closely imitates the well-known Pac-Man arcade game which had begun its rise to popularity two years earlier.  The player controls a small, white character, moving it through various maze-like levels, gobbling green and purple dots and avoiding the four roaming ghosts. The game's instructions refer to the dots as "gumdrops" and the ghosts as the "Gumdrop Guards." The player uses the J, K, W and S keys to move the character left, right, up or down.

Sequel.

A follow-up title, Snack Attack II, was co-authored by Michael Abrash and Dan Illowsky and published in late 1982 by Funtastic.  The game is quite similar to the original, but with various improvements and enhancements.

<doc id="1018814" title="Meta" nonfiltered="831" processed="823" dbindex="1480837">


Meta (Greek:      = "after", "beyond"), is a common English prefix, used to indicate a concept which is an abstraction from another concept, used to analyze the latter. For example "metaphysics" refers to the book that came after Aristotle's work on nature Physics in the classical ordering (and, by extension, to the philosophical domain of this book), but "meta language" refers to a type of language or system which describes (i.e. is about) language.

In epistemology, the prefix meta- is used to mean about (its own category). For example, metadata are data about data (who has produced it, when, what format the data are in and so on). Similarly, metamemory in psychology means an individual's knowledge about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. Any subject can be said to have a meta-theory, which is the theoretical consideration of its foundations and methods.

Another, slightly different interpretation of this term is "about" but not "on". For example, a grammar is considered as a metalanguage, a meta-answer is not a real answer but a reply, such as: "this is not a good question", "I suggest to ask your professor". Here, we have such concepts as meta-reasoning and meta-knowledge. 

From the Hypercomputing Dictionary: A prefix meaning 'one layer of information removed'. If X is some concept then meta-X is "data about or processes operating on X". The dual directionality of meta can be illustrated in the concept of an 'explanation'. If someone says, "what does that mean?" one can offer them either a definition and explanation or an example - either are accepted.

In organic chemistry, "meta" (along with "ortho" and "para") is used to distinguish the three types of isomer of disubstituted benzenes: it indicates that the substituents are at locants 1 and 3.  It is printed in italic type, and is often abbreviated as m in compound names. For example, the compound name meta-xylene is equivalent to m-xylene.


Etymology.
The prefix is derived by back-formation from the Ancient Greek preposition and prefix meta- (    ) which meant either "after" or "beside". This prefix occurred in the name of one part of Aristotle's works, the metaphysics, which originally meant simply "(the parts that come) after physics". The title was later understood to mean "(that which is) beyond physics", and meta- was thus re-analyzed as meaning "beyond".

Quine and Hofstadter.

The OED cites uses of the meta- prefix as "beyond, about" (such as meta-economics and meta-philosophy) going back to 1917. However, these formations are directly parallel to the original "metaphysics" and "metaphysical", that is, as a prefix to general nouns (fields of study) or adjectives. Going by the OED citations, it began to be used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929. A notable early citation is Quine's 1937 use of the word "metatheorem", where meta- clearly has the modern meaning of "an X about X" (Note that earlier uses of "meta-economics" and even "metaphysics" do not have this doubled conceptual structure, they are about or beyond X but they do not constitute an X). Note also that this modern meaning allows for self-reference, since if something is about the category to which it belongs, it can be about itself; it is therefore no coincidence that we find Quine, a mathemetician interested in self-reference, using it.

Douglas Hofstadter, in his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach (and in the less-popular sequel, Metamagical Themas), popularized this meaning of the term. This book, which deals extensively with self-reference and touches on Quine and his work, was influential in many computer-related subcultures, and is probably largely responsible for the popularity of the prefix, for its use as a solo term, and for the many recent coinages which use it. Hofstadter uses the meta as a stand-alone word, both as an adjective and as a directional preposition ("going meta", a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction, as in "This debate isn't going anywhere."). This book is also probably responsible for the direct association of "meta" with self-reference, as opposed to just abstraction. The sentence "This sentence contains thirty six letters." along with the sentence it is embedded in are examples of sentences that reference themselves in this way.

The Metacorder.
The Metacorder is a theoretical device described in the short story of the same name by Tristan Parker. As the story describes, the Metacorder is a computational device which does nothing other than monitoring its own activities. While in practice this would result in an endless loop similar to the print "print" quine, the story takes this idea and gives it a sort of intelligence which allows the Metacorder to consider and judge its own actions.

This is an example of constrained writing, both in that the story describes a single object over the course of several pages, and that it is done entirely in the voice of such an object being described. This double rule allows much playfulness, however, and the story ranges from realistic technical descriptions to vague, poetic musings while still keeping the same voice throughout.

Words using the term 'meta' or 'meta-'.
Common uses of the English prefix include:
 Metadata;
 Meta tag (or ), an HTML tag;
 Metacognition;
 Meta-discussion;
 Meta-ethics;
 Metafiction;
 Meta-joke;
 Meta-Knight;
 Meta-knowledge;
 Metalanguage;
 Metalogic;
 Metamathematics;
 Metamechanics;
 Metanarrative;
 Metaphilosophy;
 Metaverse;
 Metacharacter;
 Meta-modeling;

Other uses more closely follow the Greek meaning. For example:

Gardiners Island is a small island in eastern Suffolk County in the U.S. state of New York, located in Gardiners Bay between the two fluke-like peninsulas at the eastern end of Long Island. It is 6 miles long, 3 miles wide and has 27 miles of coastline.  The island is the largest privately owned island in the United States, and has been owned by the same family for nearly 400 years.

Geography.

The island is 3,318 acres in size, approximately 5 square miles (13 km²).  It includes more than 1,000 acres (4 km²) of old growth forest and another 1,000 acres (4 km²) of meadows.  Many of the buildings date back to the 17th century.   In 1989, the island was said to be worth $125 million.

The island has the largest stand of white oak in the American Northeast. Other trees include swamp maple, wild cherry and birch. The island is home to New York state's largest colony of ospreys, and is one of the few locations in the world where they build their nests on the ground, as there are no natural predators to the osprey on the island.

Its structures include the oldest surviving wood-frame structure in New York state, a carpenter's shed built there in 1639.

History.
First English Settlement in New York.
In 1639, the island was settled by Lion Gardiner from a grant by Charles I as the first colonial English settlement in present-day New York state.  The island was originally in its own jurisdiction affiliated with neither New York nor New England.  The island has been privately owned for over three hundred years by his descendants, and is the only real estate still intact as part of an original royal grant from the English Crown.

Lion Gardiner reportedly purchased the island in 1639 from the Montaukett Indians for "a large black dog, some powder and shot, and a few Dutch blankets."  The Indians called the island Manchonake, while the Gardiners initially called it Isle of Wight.  The Montauketts gave Gardiner title at least in part because of his support for them in the Pequot War.

The original 1639 royal patent gave Gardiner the "right to possess the land forever" with the island being declared a proprietary colony with the Gardiners getting the title of Lord of the Manor and thus able to establish laws for the island.

After it was decided that the British rather than Dutch would rule Long Island and that it would be part of New York rather than Connecticut a new patent was issued to Gardiner's son David Gardiner on October 5 1665 by Governor Richard Nicolls.

In 1688 when Govenor Donegan granted the patent formally establishing the East Hampton government, there was an attempt to annex it to East Hampton.  However the Gardiners resisted and the governor reaffirmed its special status..  The island's special status was to continue until after the American Revolution when it was formally annexed to East Hampton.

Gardiner established a plantation on the island for growing corn, wheat, fruit, and tobacco, as well for raising livestock.  
Captain Kidd.
The alleged pirate Captain Kidd buried treasure on the island in June 1699.  Kidd stopped while sailing to Boston to attempt to clear his name.  With the permission of the proprietor Mrs. Gardiner he buried $30,000 in treasure in  a ravine between Bostwick's Point and the Manor House. For her troubles he gave her a piece of gold cloth (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar as well as a bag of sugar.  Kidd warned that if it was not there when he returned he would kill the Gardiner.  Kidd was to be tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered by Governor Bellomont to deliver the treasure as evidence.  The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks, porringers.  Gardiner kept one of the diamonds which he gave his daughter.  A plaque on the island marks the spot but it is on private property.  
American Revolution.
The current manor house was built in 1774.  The Gardiners sided with the colonists during the American Revolution.  However a fleet of 13 ships sailed into Cherry Harbor and began a process of foraging the island and its manor house at will and were to turn it into a private hunting preserve.  Among the British guests were Henry Clinton and John André.  At one point Major Andre and Gardiner son Nathaniel Gardiner, who was a surgeon for the New Hampshire Continental Infranty, exchanged toasts on the island.  Gardiner would later be the American surgeon who attended to Andre when he was executed after being caught spying with Benedict Arnold.  

Following the revolution, the island was formally brought under East Hampton town jurisdiction.

War of 1812.
During the War of 1812 a British fleet of seven ships of the line and several smaller frigates anchored in Cherry Harbor and conducted raids on American shipping Long Island Sound.  Crews would come ashore for provisions which were purchased at market prices.  During one of the British excursions, Americans captured some of the crew.  The British came to arrest then Lord of the Manor John Lyon Gardiner.  Gardiner, who was a delicate man, adopted the "green room defense" where he stayed in a bed with green curtains surrounded by medicine to make him look feeble.  The British not wanting a sick man onboard let him be.  

The British were to bury several personnel on the island.  Some of the British fleet that burned Washington assembled in the harbor in 1814.

Gardiner's supply boats were manned by slaves during the war and this made it easier for them to pass through British lines.  Many of the Gardiner slaves were to live in the Freetown (East Hampton), just north of East Hampton (village), New York.
Birthplace of First Lady Julia Gardiner Tyler.
Julia Gardiner who was to become President John Tyler's First Lady was born on the island in 1820.
Gardiners Point Lighthouse and Fort Tyler.

From 1854 to 1894, the island was the site of the Gardiners Island Lighthouse.  Most proprietors lived in the island up until 1920, when it was leased and became a hunting preserve.  
Challenges to Private Ownership.
Owing to the high cost of upkeep, in 1937 the island was put up for sale but was bought at the last minute by a relative, Sarah Diodati Gardiner, for $400,000.  Upon her death in 1953, the island passed in trust to her nephew Robert David Lion Gardiner, and his sister, Alexandra Gardiner Creel. Their aunt had also set aside a trust fund for upkeep of the island, but it was exhausted by the 1970s.

When Creel died, her rights passed to her daughter, Alexandra Creel Goelet.

The two were to have a highly publicized dispute over ownership and direction of the island.

Gardiner accused Alexandra of wanting to sell and develop the island.  She accused him of not paying his share of the estimated $2 million/year upkeep and taxes of the island.  Gardiner said he would not oppose ownership by the government or a private conservancy group. 

The case went to court in 1980 and Gardiner was initially barred from visiting the island but in 1992  courts rule he could visit the island (although the Goelets and Gardiner were not on the island at the same time).

Gardiner, who claimed the title "16th Lord of the Manor of Gardiner's Island" and lived in East Hampton, married in 1961 but had no children, leaving him with no heir. In the 1990's, Mr. Gardiner attempted to adopt a middle aged Mississippi businessman, George Gardiner Green, as his "son"   Green was said to have been a descendent of Lion Gardiner.

Upon Gardiner's death in 2004 ownership totally passed to Alexandra.  

The Goelets have offered to place a conservation easement on the island in exchange for a promise from the town of East Hampton to not up-zone the island, change its assessment, or attempt to acquire it by condemnation.  East Hampton has granted the easement through 2025.  Thereafter the new owners could develop the island. 

Shortly before Gardiner's death he said:

We have always married into wealth. We've covered all our bets. We were on both sides of the Revolution, and both sides of the Civil War. The Gardiner family always came out on top.;

Gnégnéri Yaya Touré also spelt Yahya Toure ,English pronounced Yaa Yaa Toure, Arabic pronounced Yaheeyaa Tooray (born May 13, 1983 in the Ivory Coast) is an Ivorian footballer who currently plays for AS Monaco. He has 17 caps for the Côte d'Ivoire.

Himself a midfielder, Yaya Touré is the younger brother of Arsenal F.C defender Kolo Touré and has a younger brother Ibrahim Touré who plays for OGC Nice.

Touré joined a youth academy - ASEC Mimosas - in 1996. After two years in KSK Beveren (Belgium) and two more at FC Metalurh Donetsk (Ukraine), he moved to Olympiacos in 2005. He was nicknamed the new Patrick Vieira by his brother Kolo. He is said to have attracted the interest of clubs such as Olympique Lyon, Manchester United, Chelsea and A.C. Milan, but has since expressed a wish to play alongside his brother Kolo at Arsenal. He was also selected by Eurosport in 2005 as one of the most promising young players worldwide, where players as Javier Mascherano and Sergio Agüero were included as well. It has since emerged that Arsenal made a ¤7m bid in January 2006 which was rejected as the club wanted to wait to the summer to consider selling. Some said Yaya was annoyed by this.

Olympiakos decided to accept a mere 4.5 million euro proposal from A.S. Monaco as a result of the player's refusal to return to Greece for the team's pre-season training. The player accused Olympiacos of not paying his due salaries, while Olympiacos accused him of lying in order to get transferred. Yaya Touré has now signed for AS Monaco of France as of August, 15, 2006.

Yaya Touré is a centre midfielder who stands out for his physical abilities. Very capable in holding and protecting the ball, Yaya excels in a variety of passes, including long, short and direct. In difficult situations, when his team is on pressure, he has the ability of making forward runs, thus he has been recognised as a box-to-box player.

 Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law .

The Bazelon Center is a national legal-advocacy organization representing people with mental disabilities. Originally known as The Mental Health Law Project, the Center was founded as a national public-interest organization in 1972 by a group of specialized attorneys and mental disability professionals who were working to help the court define a constitutional right to treatment in terms of specific standards for services and protections. In 1993, the organization changed its name to the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law to honor the legacy of Judge David L. Bazelon, whose decisions as Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had pioneered the field of mental health law.

The Center's precedent-setting litigation has established important civil rights for people with mental illnesses or developmental disabilities. These include the right to treatment in Wyatt v. Stickney (decided in 1971 and successfully concluded in 1999), and the Supreme Court's 1999 Olmstead decision affirming the right of people with disabilities to receive public services in the most integrated setting consistent with their needs. 

The Center also engages in federal policy advocacy, working with Congress and the administrative agencies to ensure, for example, that people with mental disabilities are included under the protections of the Americans with Disabilities Act and amendments to the federal Fair Housing Act, and to generate resources such as SSI and Medicaid that can enable them to live and thrive in the community.

The Center provides extensive advocacy resources on its website, including excerpts or full texts of its publications. These range from an analysis of federal programs to assist children in transition out of foster care to a consumer-friendly booklet on how ex-offenders with mental illnesses can access federal benefits promptly upon their release from jail or prison.

Babayaga Ojo is a Polish underground punk rock band from Puszczykowo, near Poznan. The band was founded in 1985 but was disbanded from 1993 to 2005. The band was reanimated by "Kóbe ." Recently the guitarist "Domin" (son of Ma gorzata Ostrowska from the polish band Lombard) left and was replaced by Adrian Mróz, who currently is also the group's manager. Adrian and Domin are both playing on the group's first CD project. The group is currently working on completing the 14 track album "Si a." There are plans on creating 1000 Free Sample Works (titled Singles) from this album and releasing it to the market. The group is taking steps from leaving the Underground World in an attempt to step into mainstream Polish entertainment. 

 Biography .

The band was formed in 1985 by Bangolot, going by the name Cmentarna Elita, and after some time the name was changed to Babayaga Ojo, and it remained at that to today. They won first prize on the Poza Kontrole Contest in Warsaw in 1986 and also performed on the Jarocin festival in that same year. In 1987, their demo was recorded in the Student Radio Winogrady, where songs such as Za ogowcy, Co Wy Robicie, and Londyn were recorded.

Practices took place at Bangolot's home in different places, from the attic, to the garage, to the laundry room and bathroom, where the drummer because of a lack of space sat on the toilet, the bassist stood in the bathtub, and the rest somehow found their place. At each practice came many friends and guests, the happiest person of all was the local food salesclerk, because cheap wine was sold by the case load. At times practices lasted several days. 

After recording their next demo in 1992, with a new set-up and arrangement, the band gave out the cassette Zdusi Was Trupi Smród/Good Bye Nancy Spungen. Soon after Bangolot ended the band activity. Unfortunately in 2002, Bangolot died in a car accident, and with him his dream for Babayaga Ojo. 



In 2003, Ko , Kostek, and Kóbe  were deciding wether to reanimate Babayaga Ojo, or continue the silence. Finally in 2004 Kóbe  put together the band. The main assembly was and idea of the old punks joined with the ambitious youth. After a long search the band was finally put together.

<doc id="655338" title="Slender Inshore Squid" nonfiltered="840" processed="832" dbindex="1480846">


The Slender Inshore Squid, also known as the Arrow Squid (Loligo (Undetermined) plei), is a medium-sized squid belonging to the family Loliginidae. It occurs abundantly in coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean, from Argentina northward to North Carolina.

 Physical description .
As both common names imply, these squid have elongate, cylindrical bodies with a length to width ratio of 7:1. The arms are in contrast short and weak; the two tentacles are somewhat less than the mantle length. The rhombus-shaped fins are large, up to about 50 percent of the mantle length. Running the ventral length of the mantle is a noticeable ridge. The squid are a reddish orange colour with a large compliment of chromatophores.

The suckers of the arms possess blunt teeth. On the meaty ends (clubs) of the tentacles, there are four rows of suckers; the inner two (mesial) rows are three times as large as the outer two (marginal) rows. The larger suckers have horny rings with up to 45 teeth.

These squid reach a maximum mantle length of 33 centimetres in males and 22 centimetres in females. Sexual dimorphism is apparent, with the left ventral arm in males modified into a hectocotylus; this is used to facilitate fertilization during mating. Males also have a number of purple stripes running lengthwise on the ventral side of the mantle; along with other visual cues produced by chromatophores, these stripes are used in elaborate courtship displays.

 Ecology .
Due to their abundance, Slender Inshore Squid are important to both commercial and subsistence fisheries. During the annual summer mating season, the squid congregate in large numbers near shore. During the austral summer in waters off Brazil, annual catches may reach 763 metric tonnes.

While there may be safety in their numbers, the squid are an important prey item for large fish such as tuna and sharks and a number of cetaceans: Pygmy Killer Whales, Orcas, Atlantic Spotted Dolphins, Rough-toothed Dolphins, and Bottlenose Dolphins are all known predators of Slender Inshore Squid. Other predators include South African and Antarctic Fur Seals.

The squid prey upon several species of estuarine fish, including: killifish, mosquitofish and mollies. Small crustaceans such as grass shrimp are also taken.

It is exactly the opposite of another show, Beautiful Trio (   ,   ), also produced by Mediacorp. While Beautiful Trio talks about the problems that Singaporean women face, Measure of Man is the opposite, where the show talks about the problems men face. In Beautiful Trio, the 3 Mediacorp Actresses are the main leads, and in this show, 3 Mediacorp actors are the main leads. They are: Huang Wenyong, Ben Yeo and Zhang Yaodong. The 2 shows have the same director and executive produer. This show has a total of 25 episodes and it has also been rated as having the highest viewership drama rate for year 2006. Veteran actor and actress Huang Wenyong and Aileen Tan are seen as potential Star Awards Best Actor and Best Actress nominees in the upcoming Star Awards because of their excellent acting that the audience enjoyed.

The cast had received some good remarks and some critics for their acting. Aileen Tan, Huang Wenyong and Li Yinzhu (Cai Lianwei's sister-in-law) had received good remarks as they brought out the character very well, especially Aileen, who acted as a fierce woman, always scolding her husband. On the other hand, new actors and actresses who had just joined Mediacorp for less than 2 years such as Ben and Ezann were at the receiving end of critics for their lousy acting, and were not to the favour of the audience.

<doc id="2730373" title="Shell Lake murders" nonfiltered="844" processed="836" dbindex="1480850">

The Shell Lake murders is the name of a single mass murder incident committed by Victor Ernest Hoffman (b. 1946, d. May 21, 2004) in Shell Lake, Saskatchewan, during the early morning of August 15, 1967. Nine people, all members of James Peterson's family, were shot in the head by a man who was later called "Canada's worst random mass murderer."

Victor Hoffman was 21 years old at the time and had been released from a mental hospital just three weeks before the murders. In the morning of August 15 he entered the Peterson's farm armed with a .22-calibre Browning pump-action repeater rifle. He then proceeded to shoot all members of the Peterson family, seven of them children, at close range around the four-room house. According to police 28 shots were fired in total, of which 27 found their target. 

Mr. Peterson was shot in the kitchen, while his wife Evelyn and her one-year old baby were found in the backyard. The other six children were shot while sleeping in their bedrooms. Their ages ranged from 2 to 17 years old. Phyllis Peterson, then 4 years old, was the lone survivor of the massacre. She was sleeping under the bedclothes between her two sisters and thus was not noticed by Hoffman. However, Hoffman later declared that he spared her because "she had the face of an angel." 

The bodies were found by a neighbor who was to help Mr. Peterson with farm duties later that morning. He had to travel 6 km (3.7 mi) to the next telephone post before he could report the incident to the police. The police immediately started an extensive manhunt on the surroundings of the house.

Aftermath.

On August 19, 1967, Hoffman was arrested by the RCMP without putting up resistance. He was found at his parents' home in Leask, about 65 km (40 mi) southwest of Shell Lake. After his arrest he told the police that he had fought the devil before the murders and described him as being "tall, black and having no genitals." He was remanded to a mental hospital in North Battleford where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

Hoffman was found not guilty by reason of insanity on non-capital murder charges in February 1968. During the trial Crown prosecutor Serge Kujawa called Hoffman "the craziest man in Saskatchewan." He was put under the custody of the provincial Health Ministry and sent to a mental institution. He remained most of the time in an Ontario-based institution until December 2001, when he was granted supervised access to the towns of Penetanguishene, Port McNicol and Midland in Ontario. This decision was not without controversy since the hospital was only required to inform the local police of Hoffman's release.

Canadian journalist Peter Tadman wrote a book about the murders in 1992 and had the chance to interview Hoffman several times. According to Tadman, Hoffman felt no guilt about the murders and reported that he still saw the devil that compelled him to commit them.

Hoffman died of cancer under custody on May 21, 2004.

Hugh P. Coveney (; 20 July 1935   15 March 1998) was a senior Irish Fine Gael politician, and a noted yachtsman.

Hugh Coveney was born into one of Cork's prosperous "merchant prince" families in 1935. He was educated at Christian Brothers College, Cork, Clongowes Wood and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. He worked as a chartered quantity surveyor before entering politics.

Political career.
Coveney was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1981 as a Fine Gael TD for Cork South Central. He lost his seat in the first general election of 1982 but regained it in the second election in the same year. He lost his seat again in 1987 and didn't contest the 1992 election. He was elected to the Dáil again in 1994 in a by-election.

He was first appointed to the Cabinet in 1994 under John Bruton. Coveney was appointed Minister for Defence & Minister for the Marine. However, he was demoted to a junior ministry the following year after allegations of improper contact with businessmen.

He died on March 14, 1998, after falling from a seaside cliff while out walking alone. His son, Simon Coveney, was elected to succeed him as TD in the resulting by-election and is currently also a Fine Gael MEP for Munster.

Yachting.
Coveney's yacht Golden Apple of The Sun (designed by Cork-based designer Ron Holland) was a successful competitor in the Admiral's Cup in the 1970s.

A later 50-foot yacht Golden Apple was used by the family for the "Sail Chernobyl" project. The family sailed around the world to raise ¤650,000 for the Chernobyl Children's Project, a charity which offers assistance to children affected by the 1986 accident at the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, Ukraine.

Islington Green is a triangle of open land at the convergence of Upper Street and Essex Road (once called Lower Street) in the London Borough of Islington. It roughly marks the northern boundary between the modern district of the Angel with Islington Proper.

It has to be said that there is not much to Islington Green in modern times. But it is an important landmark that has given its name to the Screen on the Green cinema and a pleasant enough place to eat lunch in summer. Historically, it is not an old village green, like so many small green remnants in London (for example, Shacklewell Green), but a surviving patch of common land like Newington Green to the north, that was carved out of old manorial wasteland where local farmers and tenants had free grazing rights. (Before it became a part of London, Islington was a traditional pastoral, rather than an arable farming district.) The original land was far more extensive, but was largely built over in the 19th century.


Besides a dignified whitewashed memorial to the dead of both world wars, the green is notable for the statue of Sir Hugh Myddleton, designer of the New River that was so important to London's water supply from the 17th century onwards. The statue, fittingly, surmounts a fountain, but this, sadly, is no longer functioning. The New River itself once terminated about a kilometre to the south in Finsbury, but the section that can be still walked in modern times, the New River Walk, ends just to the north of the green off Essex Road. The north side of the green also carries a plaque to the once-famous Collins's Music Hall, which burned down in 1958. A Waterstone's bookshop now occupies the site.

Philip Effiong (November 18, 1925   November 6 2003), also spelled Efiong, was the first Vice President and the second and last President of the now defunct Republic of Biafra, during the 30-month Nigeria-Biafra civil war of  1967 to 1970. 

Born Obong Philip Effiong in the British West African colony of Nigeria, Effiong joined the Nigerian Armed Services on July 28, 1945. He quickly rose through the service ranks until January 11, 1956 when he received the Queen's Commission after his officer cadet training at Eaton Hall in Chester. England later commissioned him for duty in the Rhine in West Germany. Effiong was then transferred to the Nigerian Army Ordnance Corps and then to England for further training after a peace keeping stint in the Republic of Congo in 1961.

During the Nigeria-Biafra war, Effiong became Vice-President of Biafra under President Odumegwu Ojukwu. 

Even before the war, the area was net importer of food, depending on income from its oil fields to feed its populace.  The tactics of the Nigerian military during the war included economic blockade and deliberate destruction of agricultural land.    This led to mass dislocation and starvation of the populace.  Two to three million people are thought to have died in the conflict, mostly through starvation and illness.

When Biafra's military resistance collapsed, Ojukwu fled to the Côte d'Ivoire.

It was in this situation of turmoil, starvation, and collapse that Effiong assumed leadership.  Effiong became president of Biafra on 8 January 1970 and on 12 January announced surrender. 

At the time of the surrender, Effiong believed that the situation was hopeless and that prolonging the conflict would have led only to the further destruction and starvation of the people of Biafra. At that time Effiong said, "I am convinced now that a stop must be put to the bloodshed which is going on as a result of the war. I am also convinced that the suffering of our people must be brought to an immediate end." 

To the surprise of many in the outside world, threatened reprisals and massacres did not occur after the surrender, and genuine attempts were made at reconciliation.  At least part of the credit for this situation must go to Effiong's leadership and diplomacy at this crucial moment.

In a 1996 interview, Effiong reflected on those events:

I have no regrets whatsoever of my involvement in Biafra or the role I played. The war deprived me of my property, dignity, my name. Yet, I saved so many souls on both sides and by this, I mean Biafra and Nigeria.  . . . ;

I felt that I played a role which has kept this country united till today. . . .

At the end of it all when I saw they (Biafran soldiers) could no longer continue and Ojukwu had fled, I did what was ideal after wide consultation . . . ;

Effiong died November 6 2003, at the age of 78 years, not long before he would have turned 79 on 18 November.

A man from Glastonbury was betrothed to a girl from Wookey.  A witch living in Wookey Hole cursed the romance so that it failed.  The man, now having become a monk, sought revenge on this witch, who frequently spoiled budding relationships (having been jilted herself).

As kind of an entertainer he mixes a bit of comedy with his push up feats, thus making fitness fun for him and those around him who see him at shows, schools and even airport lobbies. Doug's best record is a Guinness world records record and that is for: 1781 back of hand push ups in one hour. Of course he had to do it twice and without laughing. Another one he tried was one arm back of hand push ups, he did 677 also setting a Guinness World Record in that one. Pruden's routine includes, walking, cycling, sit-ups, squats and of course push ups his favorite. His work out can last for hours. 
 
He is not in the military (but he wished he did) but often has mentored some military and even police people.  
Pruden has appeared in the Guinness World Records book, The Book of Alternative Records, and the Record Holders Republic.  
His records are also featured on many world records web pages. 

Doug holds more "current" world records in push ups than any other athlete.  Doug has challenged other athletes, and has many Alberta, Canadian, and world records in push ups.  His records are in 4 categories including; one arm, one arm back of the hand, back of the (two) hands, and fist(knuckles).  The most he has done in regular push ups is 10,000 in 8 hours!  And over 9 million in his lifetime so far.  A great guest speaker for schools and an awesome person of faith.  For now he is happy with doing push up record attempts.

Records.

Pigeon Spire may be one of the most climbed of the spires in The Bugaboos owing to its relatively low prominence from the Vowell Glacier and the existence of an easy route (the West Ridge; II, 5.4). It is not uncommon to have a couple dozen people on this route on a busy weekend. There are longer, harder routes on the spire's North and East faces.

Loutropoli Thermis (                 ) is a municipality located on the east coast of the island of Lesbos, in the Lesbos Prefecture, Greece. Population 3,809 (2001).  Thermis is the seat of the municipality that comprises Thermi, Pigi, Komi, Mistegna and Nees Kydonies.  

History.
The region of Thermi has a history going back five thousand years.  The region takes its name from the thermal springs located there for centuries.  Archaeological finds indicate that during antiquity, the goddess Artemis was worshipped as protector of the curative springs.  

After archaeological excavations in the past years next to the beach, the layers and traces of five cities built one over the other were revealed, the oldest of which dates back to the middle of the 3rd millennium. 
The magnificence and the radiance of the religious and therapeutic centre of Thermi is also testified by numerous archaeological finds, including the foundations of buildings and inscriptions.  Some of these relics are exhibited at the outdoor archaeological site of Horafa. At the beginning of the 20th century, the region of Thermi was popular for its luxurious hotel, Sarlitza Palace, which was built on the plans of French architects.  For about thirty years, it received great recognition, attracting visitors and celebrities from all over the world.  Today it is in decline and only the hot baths are operational.

Simplon Pass (Italian: Passo del Sempione) (2008 m./6589 ft.) is a high mountain pass at in the Lepontine Alps between Switzerland and Italy. It connects Brig in the canton of Valais with Domodossola in Piedmont. The pass itself is, together with the first villages across the border such as Gaby, still in Switzerland. 


The Simplon Tunnel is a railroad tunnel that likewise connects Brig with Domodossola, though its relatively straight trajectory does not run under the pass itself. It actually consists of two single-track tunnels built nearly 20 years apart. For more than half a century it was considered to be the longest tunnel in the world (see World's longest tunnels). 
Simplon tunnel was finally completed in 1906. The Italian king Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and the  president of the Swiss National Council Ludwig Forrer were opening the tunnel at the Swiss town of Brig in May 10.The builders of the tunnel were  Hermann Häustler and Hugo von Kager and the tunnel was 19,7 km long.The  second tube of the tunnel was opened in 1922 and it was 19,824 m long. 

The tunnel was subject to major structural renovation works from 1985 - 2003 following the goal to increase its structure gauge by lowering the trackbed to accommodate rolling highway trains transporting heavy goods vehicles (HGV).

The former Simplon département (the Swiss canton Valais) was named after the pass.

<doc id="414275" title="Prefecture (China)" nonfiltered="861" processed="852" dbindex="1480867">


Prefecture, in the context of China, is used to refer to several unrelated political divisions in both ancient and modern China.

In a modern context, prefecture-level (   , abbreviated   , "region") is used to refer to a level of division between the province and county levels. The prefecture level is the second level in the administrative hierarchy of the People's Republic of China. There are four kinds of prefecture-level divisions: prefectures, prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, and leagues.

The modern Chinese prefecture is a relatively recent creation. When the word "prefecture" is encountered in literature referring to ancient China, it refers to either the xian or the zhou, which are two other types of administrative division.

 Prefecture .
Prefectures (   pinyin: dìq ) are governed by administrative offices (     xíngzhèngg ngsh ), led by a head of office (     xíngzhèngsh uzh ng) appointed by the province.

At one point, prefectures were the most common type of prefecture-level division. Today they have been mostly converted into prefecture-level cities, and the trend is still ongoing.

There are 17 prefectures remaining in mainland China, mostly in Xinjiang and Tibet.

 Prefecture-level city .
Main article: Prefecture-level city

Prefecture-level cities (    pinyin: dìjíshì) are cities that are given prefecture status and the right to govern surrounding counties. In practice, prefecture-level cities are so large that they are just like any other administrative division, and not cities in the traditional sense of the word at all.

Prefecture-level cities are the most common type of prefecture-level division in mainland China today.

 League .
Main article: League (Inner Mongolia)

Leagues (  pinyin: méng) are the prefectures of Inner Mongolia. The name comes from an ancient Mongolian administrative unit, which were used during the Qing Dynasty in Mongolia. During the ROC rule, the leagues had status equivalent to provinces. Leagues contain banners, equivalent to counties.

Just like prefectures, most leagues have been replaced by prefecture-level cities. There are only 3 leagues remaining in Inner Mongolia.

 Autonomous prefecture .
Main article: Autonomous prefecture

Autonomous prefectures (    pinyin: zìzhìzh u) either have over 50% of the population with ethnic minorities or are historically resided by significant minorities. All autonomous prefectures are mostly dominated, in population, by the Han Chinese. The official name of an autonomous prefecture includes the most dominant minority in that region, sometimes two, rarely three. For example, a Kazakh (Kazak in official naming system) prefecture may be called Kazak Zizhizhou. 

Like all other prefecture-level divisions, autonomous prefectures are divided into county-level divisions. There is one exception: Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture contains two prefectures of its own.

Under the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, autonomous prefectures cannot be abolished.

 Development zone .
Development zones (    pinyin: k if q ) were temporary prefecture-level divisions. Chongqing was a development zone before it became a municipality, and two development zones were set up within Chongqing immediately after it became a municipality. These divisions were temporary and no longer exist.

 Legal status .

The constitution of the People's Republic of China does not endorse any prefecture-level division, except for autonomous prefectures. Prefectures and leagues are not at all mentioned; provinces are explicitly stated to be divided directly into counties.

The constitution does not explicit endorse the existence of prefecture-level cities; but it does mention that "comparatively large cities" (    ) are divided into counties and districts. However, there are only 49 prefecture-level cities that have been designated as "comparatively large". As a result, the vast majority of prefecture-level cities do not have the constitutional basis for governing districts and counties.

The wholesale conversion of prefectures into prefecture-level cities has resulted in the phenomenon of "cities containing cities"   prefecture-level cities containing county-level cities. There is no legal basis for this, not even for the 49 "comparatively large cities". Thus, the county-level cities technically do not "belong" to the prefecture-level city, but are instead "governed on behalf" of the province by the prefecture-level city, though in practice the county-level cities do indeed belong to their governing prefecture-level cities.

 Ancient sense .

In the history of the political divisions of China, the word "prefecture" has been applied onto two unrelated types of division: the xian and the zhou. In general the word "prefecture" is applied onto xian for the period before the Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty; for the period after, xian are called "districts" or "counties", while "prefectures" now refer to zhou.

 Xian .

Xian ( / ) were first established during the Warring States Period, and have existed continuously ever since. Today, they continue to form an important part of the political divisions of China.

Xian has been translated using several English language terms. In the context of ancient history, "district" and "prefecture" are the most commonly used terms, while "county" is generally used for more contemporary contexts.

See County (China and Taiwan) for more information.

 Zhou .

Zhou ( ) were first established during the Han Dynasty, and were abolished only with the establishment of the Republic of China.

Zhou is generally translated as "province" or "region" for the period before the Sui Dynasty, and "prefecture" for the period from the Sui Dynasty onwards.

The People's Republic of China has revived the word zhou as part of the term "zizhizhou" (   ), which is translated as "autonomous prefectures", as described above.

See Zhou (political division) for more information.

<doc id="3827918" title="Allan Moffat" nonfiltered="867" processed="857" dbindex="1480873">
Allan George Moffat, OBE, (born November 10, 1939 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) is an Australian racing driver known for his success in the Australian Touring Car Championship and his four wins in the Bathurst 1000.

Born in Canada, Moffat first came to Australia as a college student with his parents in the early 1960s and lived permanently in the country since the latter part of that decade, when he embarked on his record-setting racing career.  He had already raced in the United States before his move to Australia, his first race behind the wheel of a Triumph TR3.

1965 to 1971.
Moffat first entered the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) in 1965, driving a Lotus Cortina.  By 1969 he had become a regular competitor and his bright red Coca-Cola-sponsored Trans-Am Ford Mustang was unmistakable at circuits around Australia.  He would go on to win 101 ATCC races in this car between 1969 and 1972.

Although Moffat and many other drivers raced Mustangs for ATCC competition - the five ATCC titles from 1965 to 1969 were all won by Mustangs - this car was ineligible for the Bathurst 500 (later changed to Bathurst 1000) which was restricted to Series Production cars, and Moffat made his debut in that race in a Ford Falcon XW GTHO Phase I in 1969.  He and co-driver Alan Hamilton finished 4th.

The following two years would see Moffat come into his own as one of Australia's most dominant race drivers, and the Falcon GTHO as an almost unbeatable car.  For 1970, Ford had made significant improvements to the Falcon XW GTHO Phase II over the previous year's model and Moffat, racing without a co-driver, took the car to two crushing victories in the 1970 and 1971 Bathurst races.  In 1971 he became the first driver to lead the Bathurst 500 from start to finish while driving the famed Ford Falcon XY GTHO Phase III.

1972.
Moffat looked headed for an historic third straight Bathurst victory in 1972 when Ford unveiled plans for a "Phase IV" Falcon GTHO, even faster and more brutal than the Phase III which Moffat had taken to victory in 1971.  The Australian press caught wind of these plans, however, and headlines across the country screamed, "160mph Supercars On Our Roads!"  Facing pressure from the media and government not to produce this car, as entering it at Bathurst would also require at least 200 units to be sold at dealerships in Australia, Ford scrapped production of the Phase IV and forced Moffat and other Ford drivers to resort to year-old Phase III cars for Bathurst that year.  Peter Brock won the race that year for arch-rival manufacturer Holden, after wet weather and brake dramas hobbled the Fords, and he and Moffat would establish a rivalry of their own in the years to come.

1973 to 1980.
In 1973, the Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS) changed the rules for ATCC and Bathurst cars to allow racing modifications (prior to 1973, cars had to be showroom-standard and could not be modified).  Ford, smarting from the Phase IV controversy the year before, withdrew their factory teams from competition at the end of 1973, and forced Moffat and others to form their own privateer teams, despite having assisted Moffat to victory in both the ATCC title - his first ever - and at Bathurst (with co-driver Ian Geoghegan) that year. Moffat was the first winner of the Bathurst race following its conversion from a 500-mile event to 1000km. 

Moffat struggled through the 1974 and 1975 seasons.  He failed to finish Bathurst in those years, and was only moderately competitive in ATCC races. In 1975 he drove a BMW 3.0CSL with Brian Redman to win the Sebring 12-hour.

Although he failed to finish Bathurst again in 1976, Moffat returned to drive his Falcon GT full-time in the ATCC that year and won his second title, despite the setback of a transporter fire which destroyed his race car, with several rounds left to run.

Moffat re-established his dominance in 1977.  He won his second consecutive ATCC title that year, the third of his career, but this performance was overshadowed by the crushing 1-2 victory of Moffat and team-mate Colin Bond at Bathurst.  By the mid-point of the race, Moffat and Bond led by over six laps from the rest of the field.  Late in the race, Moffat's car encountered brake problems and had to slow, allowing Bond to catch up for the cars to complete the final lap of the race side-by-side and cross the finish line in tandem, with Bond allowing Moffat to stay barely in front.  This moment is remembered as one of the most famous in Australian motor sport history, and still regarded by many as Ford's finest hour. The following year Moffat received an Order of the British Empire in 1978 for exceptional services to motor sport.

Moffat was unable to repeat his 1977 successes over the following three years.  He retired from the 1978, 1979 and 1980 Bathurst races (his last in the local Ford product) and did not win the ATCC title in those years as Holden began to gain a manufacturer's edge with their Torana A9X, which was lighter and more nimble than the heavy Falcons.  

In 1980 he competed in various cars and in various countries.  He drove a Porsche 934 turbo to win the Australian Sports Car Championship.  He also drove at the LeMans 24-hour race, sharing a Porsche 935 turbo with Indycar legend Bobby Rahal, where they were forced to withdraw whilst in fourth place. He also did a guest drive for the Marlboro Holden Dealer Team taking 3rd place in the Sandown 400km race.  The event was marked by the fact that it was Moffat's second only time in a Holden and that he was driving in the same team as his arch rival Peter Brock.

1981 and beyond.
Much to the dismay of his mostly Ford-biased fans, Moffat left the "Blue Oval" brand in 1981 to drive a Peter Stuyvesant-sponsored Mazda RX-7 as both the ATCC and Bathurst began to exhibit a shift towards lighter touring cars with less raw power.  Moffat drove the RX-7 to four consecutive top-six finishes at Bathurst between 1981 and 1984, and won his fourth and final ATCC title in 1983.  Moffat also competed at the Daytona 24-hour race in an RX-7, taking a class win in 1982 with co-drivers Lee Mulle and Kathy Rude. That same year he again competed at LeMans in a factory RX-7-based sportscar, achieving taking a class win. In 1985 he took his own RX-7 that he campaigned previously in Australia to Daytona for the 24-hour race, sharing the car with Australian drivers Gregg Hansford, Kevin Bartlett and Peter McLeod.

After sitting out the 1985 Australian season Moffat returned to Bathurst for three more years in 1986, 1987 and 1988, the first in a Holden Commodore with Peter Brock and the final brace in Ford Sierras with Cosworth engines.  These cars dominated the ATCC circuits for most of the late 1980s and won Bathurst twice in 1988 and 1989.  In 1987, after Peter Brock split with Holden, Moffat purchased the VL commodore that  Brock had intended to take to Europe to compete in the World Touring Car Championship.  In the first round of the 1987 WTCC, held in Monza, Italy, Moffat and his co-driver, ex-HDT driver John Harvey, took a surprise opening round win as a result of the leading BMW M3's being disqualified.  Later that year Moffat and Harvey drove the same Commodore to 4th place outright and a class win at the Spa 24-hour race.

Moffat's last race was in 1989 driving with Klaus Niedzwiedz, winning the Fuji 500km race in Japan. He retired from competitive motor racing that year.  He has since worked as a TV commentator and a spokesman for BMW and appears at various Ford club events across Australia. 

On February 2, 2004, he received Australian citizenship in a ceremony at the Australian Grand Prix Corporation offices in Melbourne.  He had been eligible for citizenship since the early 1970s but, in his own words, "one way or another I never followed it through." The citation itself was given by his old friend and sparring partner, the late Peter Brock.

Trivia.
 Although Moffat has lived permanently in Australia for over 35 years, his broad Canadian accent has remained intact and continues to be his trademark.

A repmobile is a semi-derogatory British term used to describe cars that are popular on the fleets of sales representatives (or reps). This term is most commonly applied to large family cars produced by mainstream manufacturers and sold cheap to fleets, e.g. Ford Mondeo and Honda Accord.

These cars are typically bought for high mileage motorway use and passed on to auctions with 100,000 or more miles at three to four years old. The fact that these cars are very common, suffer from this negative image and are sold cheap to fleets ensure that depreciation is steep.

Robert Casadesus (April 7, 1899   September 19, 1972) was a French pianist and composer.

He was born in Paris and studied at the Conservatoire there with Louis Diémer, taking a premier prix in 1913 and the Prix Diémer in 1920. From 1922 he collaborated with Ravel on a project to create piano rolls of a number of works as well as sharing concert platforms with the composer in France, Spain and England.

As a soloist he toured widely and appeared on five continents and he frequently performed with his wife, the pianist Gaby Casadesus, whom he married in 1921. His pupils include Claude Helffer and Monique Haas. From 1935 he taught at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau and he spent the Second World War years in the United States. 

His style of playing was classical and restrained. He is especially noted as one of the greatest Mozart players of all time. Among his other highly-regarded recordings are those of the music of Ravel, and the Beethoven Violin Sonatas with Zino Francescatti (of which the Kreutzer Sonata was filmed and has been released on DVD).

Casadesus was joined by his wife Gaby and their son Jean in exemplary performances of Mozart's Concertos for 2 and 3 pianos. They recorded these works with the Columbia Symphony and Cleveland Orchestras conducted by George Szell as well as with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy which has been released on Sony Classical: CD 5033962 (google for: B00005KKNZ)

Jalal ud-Dawlah Mohammad Ghaznavi (died 1041) ascended the throne of the Ghaznavid Empire upon the death of his father Mahmud in 1030. He was the younger of a set of twins; this circumstance resulted in civil strife. His reign lasted five months before he was overthrown by his twin Ma'sud I, after which he was blinded and imprisoned. Nine years later he was reinstated for a year before being slain by his nephew Maw'dud.

Career.
His uncle Yusuf Sebuktugin initially supported his coronation but later formed a confederacy supporting Mas'ud I.

Later, when the Seljuks were overrunning the Persian and Central Asian parts of the Ghaznavid Empire, a troop mutiny placed him back upon the throne, and he had his brother imprisoned in turn. He promoted his son Ahmed, allied with Suleiman the son of Yusuf Sebuktigin, to the actual day-to-day running of affairs. They are reported to have been behind the assassination of Mas'ud I while imprisoned.

Mas'ud I's son Maw'dud, then stationed in Balkh, gathered his forces and marched upon Ghazni, capturing the throne and sentencing Mohammad to death.

pianist ~ photo:Nicolas Piet]]
Sandrine Erdely-Sayo, born October 11, 1968, in Perpignan , France, is a Jewish pianist. She was a child prodigy who could play Bach and read music before knowing how to read a book. 

Biography.
Sandrine Erdely-Sayo began studying piano at the age of four at the Perpignan Conservatory in France, with Michèle Puig (Pablo Casals 'Goddauther).  At ten, she was awarded first prize at the Bellan Competition in Paris.  Three years later she won gold medals in piano and chamber music and the following year, the "prix d'excellence à l'unanimité".
She continued her musical studies with Denyse Rivière and with Christian Manen (First Grand Prize of Rome) at the Conservatoire de Paris where she received first prize for specialization in solfège.   There, she pursued special studies in harmony, counterpoint and fugue.

She became the youngest recipient of the French minister of Culture Prize at the age of thirteen.  Four years later, she won first prize at the Scène Française International Piano Competition, in Paris, was a prize winner at the IBLA International Competition in Italy, and was semi-finalist at the "Torneo Internazionale di Musica" in Rome, Italy.

At the age of 14, she wrote three pieces for chamber orchestra which were played at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris.  She came to the United States in 1990 for graduate studies with Susan Starr at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia where she received a Master's Degree in piano and composition, and won the Orchestra Competition and the Strine Award scholarship.  

Sandrine Erdely-Sayo has played in many festivals such as Mozart, Bach Festival, Festival International des Arts, Festival de Prades, the Louvre, Jewish Film Festival with the American writer Cynthia Ozick, Festival of the "Hispanidad", and for radio and television in France, United States, Spain, Italy, and Argentina.

In 1999, Erdely-Sayo made her Chicago debut at Preston Bradley Hall for the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concert.
As a chamber musician, she has performed the major repertoire by Poulenc, Messiaen, and Bartok.

Her performances combine technical virtuosity, creative interpretation and a magical lightness that makes classical music accessible to all.  She communicates with the audience musically and verbally to share history, personal experience, and humor.

She has recorded the integral work of Primitivo Lazaro in two CDs.  She has given the world premiere of pieces by Argentinean composers and the modern world premiere of a discovered piece by Francis Poulenc at Towson University.

Erdely-Sayo is an honorary member of Darius Milhaud international Competition and she is member of the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry.

She is currently teaching at Temple University Music Prep  and at the well-known Lawrenceville School. 

She has been listed in several editions of Who's Who in America, Who's Who of American Women, and Who's Who of Emerging Leaders under the age of 40.

Erdely-Sayo's favorite scientists, philosophers and writers: Albert Einstein, Evariste Galois, Vladimir Jankelevitch, Emmanuel Levinas, Irène Frain, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust .

Reviews and quotes.
"An uninhibited and personal style" "No cookie-cutter pianist".  
Peter Dobrin, Philadelphia Inquirer, USA.

"An elegant, fantaisiste, and imaginative tone". "Sandrine Erdely-Sayo belongs to a very young generation of musicians who give us happiness, joy and pride." 
J.P., Midi Libre, France.

"A pianist with idealism, passion and lyricism." 
Marco Ruiz, La Prensa, Spain. 

"The interpretation of Fauré, Chopin and Liszt convinced us of her marvellous talent." 
Chopin Society.

"Sandrine Erdely-Sayo is comfortable with all musical styles. "She possesses a pure and excellent technique." 
Randolph Faget, Musica Hoy, Argentina. 

"In the transcendental Etude of liszt, of a great technical difficulty, the young pianist has given proof of a perfect mastery and sensibility "like the skin of a flower." 
L'Indépendant, France 

"An important talent." 
Jewish Exponent, USA 

"...plays in a passionate and electrifying manner." 
Philadelphia Inquirer, USA

"This young pianist made the piano tremble as well as the public who applauds in a standing ovation for this high caliber recital."  "The young virtuose is rebellious against her marathons-days." 
Ph. Salus, L'Indépendant, France

"Sandrine is a major talent. Her wonderful musicianship is so strong as to drow the listener into deep involvement with the music. Reminds me strongly of some of the great poet pianists I have heard in the past. I believe that few young artists today have her ability to communicate so intimately."   
Maestro Joseph Primavera, April 1991

"I can assure you that Sandrine Erdely-Sayo is an excellent young artist. With her training at the Conservatoire National Superieur de musique de Paris, she brings a fresh style which is clearly European approach. The exceptional quality of her playing is certainly recognizable from the many international prizes which she has received. I believe there is a cross-cultural benefit which can serve only for the general good of music in the United States."
Gary Graffman, October 1995

San Carlo ai Catinari is an early-Baroque style church in Rome. 

The attribute ai Catinari refers to the presence, at the time of its construction, of many dishmaker shops in the same street of the church. The church was commissioned by the Order of the Barnabites and funded by the Milanese community in Rome to honour their fellow Milanese San Carlo Borromeo.


The main design was by Rosato Rosati between 1612-20. The drab, travertine façade was designed by Giovanni Battista Soria and construction occured during 1635-38. 

Interior.
The chorus in the apse has canvases depicting San Carlo (1620) by Guido Reni and Andrea Commodi, as well as a Miracle of San Biagio (1669) by Domenico Cerrini. Behind the facade are frescoes by Gregorio and Mattia Preti, showing episodes from the Life of San Carlo (1642). The spandrels of the cupola are frescoed with the Cardinal Virtues (1627-30) by Domenichino. The bronze crucifix in the sacristy is attributed to Algardi and Christ derided (1598) by Cavalier d' Arpino. 

The first chapel on the right has an Annunciation (1624) by Lanfranco; in the second chapel, there is a Martyrdom of San Biagio by Giacinto Brandi; and in the third, an altarpiece of Santa Cecilia by Antonio Gherardi. 

The second chapel on the left has an altarpiece depicting the Martyrdom of Santa Anna by Sacchi. The third chapel was designed by Paolo Marucelli with frescoes of the  Persian Martyrdoms (1641) by Romanelli and lunettes by Giacinto Gimignani.

The National Crime Authority (NCA) was an Australian law enforcement agency established in 1984 .  

In 2003 it was superseded by the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) .

The NCA was set up in the wake of the Costigan Commission into tax evasion and organised crime. It was intended to lead a national law enforcement response to organised crime which could overcome the jurisdictional barriers of the Australian federal system . 

The NCA was frequently criticised for misusing its power, but also, on the other hand, for not being effective enough .  Businessman and former Liberal Party President John Elliott accused the NCA of running a vendetta against him inspired by the then Labor government.
The NCA was replaced by the ACC in 2003 with the stated aim of streamlining the legislative and governmental framework .


The Australian Crime Commission (ACC) is a Commonwealth statutory body working nationally with other federal, state and territory agencies to counter serious and organised crime. 
The aim of the ACC is to bring together all arms of intelligence gathering and law enforcement together to fight serious and organised criminal activity.
The ACC has both intelligence and investigative functions and capabilities .

Ty Fox (born Jeffrey Dion Bruton in Falls Church, Virginia) is an American pornographic actor (porn star) who appears in gay and bisexual pornographic movies. He has also performed under the name J. Steele.

Suppressing his sexual feelings while growing up, Bruton finally had a gay sexual encounter with a fellow student while attending Georgia Southern University.  During his last six months there, in 1992, he was approached by a modeling scout in a shopping mall.  Dealing with heavy credit card debt, Bruton began a career first as a fitness and calendar model and then as a porn star under the name Ty Fox.  

He quickly developed a huge fan following, largely due to his powerful, muscular build and enthusiastic screen performances.  Among his videos were Down On It, Hot Day In L.A., Manhattan Skyline (with Christian Fox), and Fox's Lair (with Steve Fox and Ryan Fox).  Ty Fox looked upon his videos not only as a job but also as a way to explore a part of his sexuality he had denied for years.   He continued to make videos not only after getting married but also after securing a job as a middle school physical education teacher in Ashburn, Virginia. 

In 1994, he shared the award for "Best Actor" with Zak Spears at the Adult Erotic Gay Video Awards.

Trouble came in 1996, first when a fellow teacher entered an adult video store and spotted Ty/Jeff's face on a video box, and reported his moonlighting activities to school authorities.  What happened next depends on which version is consulted.  Either his wife learned of his gay video performances after a friend showed her his picture in an ad for the video Hot Day in LA and she ordered and watched the video and saw her husband having sex with other men, or she saw the same video box in the same store, or she knew all along about his gay video career and caught him in bed with another woman.  Whatever the situation leading up to the event might have been, Melanie Bruton filed for divorce.  Shortly afterward, with the Loudoun County school board beginning procedures to fire him, Bruton resigned from his teaching  job and turned in his license.   

For five months he lived in seclusion with his sister, who urged him to return to porn.   In 1997, Fox Tale appeared, wrapping Ty Fox's sex scenes around a storyline which parodied his recent outing.   He also began making appearances at strip clubs in Washington, DC and other cities, and began living in the DC area to be close to his one-year old son, to whom he had been given visitation rights.  In 2001, he came out of retirement again to perform in a film for Jet Set Studios as J. Steele. At last report he still expressed hopes of returning to the teaching profession.

The photo appearing here shows a computer-generated Washington Monument, not visible in reality from the actual location of this photograph taken at the famed Tutorsky Mansion, 1720 16th Street NW at Riggs Place in the Dupont Circle neighborhood. The Tutorsky Mansion, under a previous owner, was the location for one of Ty's gay porn films.

BC-STV is a proposed voting system recommended by the Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform for use in British Columbia.  A member of the Single Transferable Vote family of voting systems, BC-STV was narrowly defeated in a referendum in 2005, but will likely be re-proposed in identical form in 2008.

Background.

The ruling Liberal Government put together the assembly and gave it a mandate to come up with new system of selecting MLAs. The assembly recommended this system, and the Liberal Government put it to a referendum at the same time as the provincial election.  

First referendum.



BC-STV required 60% of the popular vote and 60% of the ridings to support in order for it to be passed.  It received 97% of the ridings, but only 57% of the vote.

Second referendum.

In the Speech from the Throne made to open the first session of the legislature after the 2005 election, the Campbell government clarified its next steps on electoral reform as follows:
The issue of electoral reform remains following the results of the referendum put before the public in May.  Nearly 58 per cent of all citizens who cast a ballot in the recent referendum on electoral reform supported the proposed STV electoral system. A solid majority supported STV in all but two of B.C.'s 79 constituencies. And yet that was not enough to pass, according to the rules this Legislature unanimously established.;

Your government has been clear that it does not intend to rewrite those rules after the fact, or pretend that the vote for STV succeeded when it did not.  Nor can it ignore the size of the double majority that voted to change our current electoral system to the STV model.;

[ ];

Your government does not accept that the solution to a majority vote that failed to pass is to essentially ignore it and impose yet another electoral system.  It does not accept that the answer to the minority's rejection of the Citizens' Assembly's proposal is to redo its work. It does not accept that the 79 members of this assembly are any better qualified than the 161 members of the Citizens' Assembly were to choose the best electoral model.;

[ ];

One task that was never assigned to the Citizens' Assembly was to show precisely how its proposed STV model might apply on an electoral map. This was arguably a design flaw in its terms of reference that in retrospect may have impacted how people voted in the referendum.  Your government believes that establishing STV constituency boundaries may provide the public with a critical piece of information that was missing at the time of the referendum. The government will recommend that shortcoming be rectified.;

The Legislature is obliged to appoint an Electoral Boundaries Commission this session.  Your government will use that opportunity to take the challenge of electoral reform to its ultimate conclusion. [ ]  The commission will also be asked to identify the best and fairest way to configure British Columbia's electoral districts under the STV model.  [ ] The commission will be asked to submit its final report on electoral redistribution under both electoral systems by the spring of 2008.;

That information will be put before the public as part of an extensive effort to better inform British Columbians about the two electoral options   the current system and STV.  Equal funding will be provided to support active information campaigns for supporters and detractors of each model.  The two models will be put to a province-wide vote, along with the applicable electoral boundaries, in a referendum that will be held in tandem with the November 2008 municipal elections.;

That question will be crafted by the government and will be debated and voted upon in this Legislature.  All members, including cabinet ministers, will be free to speak to it and vote as they wish.  In establishing electoral boundaries, it has been the practice that all members are invited to make representations to the Electoral Boundaries Commission.  All members will be encouraged to also use that opportunity to comment on the relative merits of both electoral models under the boundaries proposed.  No one is obliged to support STV or remain silent if they have concerns.  The Premier will remain neutral, but all government members will be free to support or oppose either model.;

In the final analysis, the people will again decide   not the politicians   which electoral model and boundaries suit them best. The people will have their final say on STV. The same rules and thresholds that applied for passing STV in the recent referendum will apply in the November 2008 referendum. Whichever model succeeds is the model that will be employed to elect the next parliament, on May 12th, 2009.  The government intends to launch a province-wide enumeration prior to that date to ensure that the British Columbia voters list is both up to date and accurate.;

However on April 27 2006 Premier Gordon Campbell said the referendum on electoral reform will now be held in tandem with the next provincial election in May 2009.

System design.
Candidates.
Political parties may run up to as many candidates as there are available seats in each electoral district; major parties will typically run several candidates (though generally not more than they might expect to be successfully elected) while smaller parties might run only single candidates. The voter ranks their top choices (1,2,3,4, etc.) from the list of candidates and may rank, or vote, for as many or few candidates as they like.  A quota for the district is determined based on the number of valid ballots cast and the number of seats available in the district.  All the votes are counted and sorted by the voters' first preferences.  Those candidates with enough first-preference votes to meet or exceed the quota are elected.  A multiple-step vote counting and transfer process then ensues to determine the winners of the remaining seats in the district.

The new electoral districts would be formed by combining several of the current electoral districts. For example, Richmond and Delta's five current electoral districts might be combined into one electoral district which would produce five winners but not necessarily from the same party. An electoral district of that size might have between 10 and 25 candidates, whose names will be grouped by political party on the ballot paper.

Electoral districts.

Under the current FPTP system British Columbians elect members from 79 one-member districts. Elections BC uses census data to maintain a uniform population level across districts so that voters have equal weight. Currently, districts have a mean population of 50,000.  However, due to migration between census, consideration of population densities, and other factors there can be great discrepancies between electoral districts. Vancouver-Burrard has the largest population at about 67,000 people and North Coast has the least population at about 27,000 people.

One of the criticisms of this method of is that in many populous communities, in order to create districts with a population of approximately 50,000, it may be necessary to draw arbitrary boundaries which do not necessarily reflect a community of interest.

An Electoral Boundaries Commission would be charged with drawing up new electoral districts.  Much larger districts will be created that will elect multiple members. Proponents argue that this would create districts with a stronger sense of community and common interest.  For example, all the electoral districts within the municipality of Vancouver could be combined to form one electoral district with its borders running along the municipal borders. All the electoral districts within the Richmond and Delta could be combined to form one electoral district. The general ratio of one MLA per 50,000 residents would be used to determine the number of MLAs elected by a district.

Foreign comparisons.

The proposed BC-STV system was chosen by the members of the Citizens' Assembly to best suit B.C. However, it has specific similarities to and distinctions from STV electoral systems currently being used in other countries.

 unlike the Australian electoral system, voters will not be required to rank every candidate;
 if votes are transferred because a candidate has exceeded the quota required to win, all of that candidate's ballots are examined for transfer votes (Senatorial rules), unlike the method used for the Irish Dáil in which, after a candidate has reached the quota, only remaining ballots are examined for further preferences (the Hare method);
In the case of a vacancy, a by-election is held using the BC-STV system.  In a riding with a single vacancy, this is equivalent to the Alternative Vote system.  This is similar to the Irish system, but differs from the system used in Australia and Malta, where the original ballots are recounted with the departing members' votes transferred to their next preferences.

USS Independence (LCS-2), the class prototype for the Independence-class littoral combat ship, will  be the sixth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the concept of independence.  It is the design competitor produced by the General Dynamics consortium, in competition with the Lockheed Martin-designed Freedom class littoral combat ship.  

The contract to build her was awarded to Austal USA of Mobile, Alabama, on 14 October 2005 and her keel was laid down on 19 January 2006.

Description.

The General Dynamics Bath Iron works design is based on a high-speed trimaran hull proven by the Austal (Henderson, Australia) hull that is currently operating at sea. It requires only a crew of fewer than 40 sailors.  The trimaran hull enables the ship to reach sustainable speeds of nearly 50 knots and range as far as 10,000 nautical miles. 

The first trimaran LCS, INDEPENDENCE (LCS 2), is under construction at Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama. The 127-meter surface combatant ship is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in July 2009, with the original contract was awarded in July 2003.  

It is designed with twice the objective payload and volume, with 11,000 cubic meters of payload volume, so that it can carry out one mission while a separate mission module is in reserve.  The large flight deck will support operation of two SH-60 helicopters, unmanned vehicles, or large H-53 class helicopters. The stable trimaran hull will allow flight operations in high sea conditions.

The first hull has been named Independence LCS-2. Fixed core capabilities will be carried for self-defense and command and control. But unlike traditional fighting ships with fixed armament such as guns and missles, innovative and tailored mission modules will be used for specific mission duties, and  configured for one mission package at a time. Models may consist of manned aircraft, unmanned vehicles, off-board sensors, or mission-manning detachments, in an expandable open-systems architecture.

The design has an off-board vehicle launch and recovery system the tail for raising and lowering small boats and watercraft. The flight deck is 1,030 sq m for 2 H-60 or 1 H-53. The hangar is 351 sq m for 2 SH-60 helicopters.

The large interior volume and payload is much greater than larger destroyers. It is sufficient to serve as a high-speed transport and maneuver platform. The mission bay is 11,800 square feet, and takes up most of the deck below the hangar and 11,100 sf flight deck. In addition to cargo or container sized mission modules, the bay can carry four lanes of multiple Strykers, armored Humvees, and their associated troops. An elevator allows air tranport of TEU-sized packages that can be moved into the mission bay while at sea. A side access ramp allows for vehicle roll-on/roll-off loading to a dock. The habitability area is under the bridge with bunks for many personell. 

The bow contains retractable mine detection sonar.  A 57 mm Bofors gun is mounted at the bow, with a 50 cal gun at either corner of the stern and sides. 3 SRBOC rapid bloom chaff and countermeasure launchers, 2 Nulka decoy launchers are mounted on P/S.  The Nulka is a hovering rocket decoy which attracts anti-ship missiles. 2 torpedo decoy launchers are mounted P/S aft, with a Surface Ship Defence (SSTD) system. A Rolling Airframe Missle launcher for 21 is mounted above the hanger.

It has an intgrated LOS Mast, Sea Giraffe Radar and SeaFLIR. Side and forward surfaces are angled for reduced radar profile. In addition, H-60 series helicopters provide airlift, rescue, anti-submarine, radar picket and anti-ship capabilities with torpedoes and missles. The ship is not designed as a base for  AV-8B Harrier jets or the V-22, but the flight deck is large enough to hold them.

Specifications: Crew 40 Cruise Speed 51 kts Length 115.2 m 378-ft Max Range 18,600 km 10,043 nm Max Speed 60 kts Full Displacement 2,800 tons Span 17.4 m 57-ft Equipment Component Parts AN/WLD-1 1 Electronic Gear TRS-3D 1 Guns Mk 110 Mod 0

<doc id="3842969" title="Ayyarun" nonfiltered="887" processed="877" dbindex="1480893">
 

Áyy r n, Arabic plural is 'ayyarun, Persian plural is 'ayyaran'; Arabic for "scoundrel" or "vagabond". This word refers to a person associated with a class of warriors in Iraq and Iran from the 9th to the 12th centuries. They were associated with futuwa/futuwwa, or medieval Islamic organizations located in cities.

Emergence.
'Ayyarun fought for Islam in Asia, though most of the writing about them centers on their Baghdad activities of the 10th to the 12th centuries. Baghdad was ruled by the Buyids (945 1055), and was a very lawless city, caused by fighting between Sunnis and Shi'ites. They did many terrible things such as extorting taxes on roads and markets, burning wealthy quarters and markets, and looting the homes of the rich by night. For several years (1028 33), Al-Burjumi and Ibn al-Mawsili, leaders of the 'ayyarun, ruled the city due to governmental instability.

Reputation.
The 'ayyarun have been commonly called thieves and robbers, though these activities are highlighted during times of week government and civil war, when their role as a military force most likely made them fight on multiple sides, angering many. During times of more stable government, their unlawful activities decreased, and when the Seljuqs ruled in the 12th century, their activities almost ceased. The 'ayyarun also made war against much of society in reaction to social injustices.

Regional influence.
Outside of Baghdad, the 'ayyarun were closely allied with the middle class, and helped maintain the current order of disrupt it. The Saffarids (861-1003) of eastern Iran, in fact, were a 'ayyarun dynasty. They are thought by some historians to have contributed to the weakening of Baghdad, clearing the way for the horrific destruction of the city by the Mongols.

<doc id="7568448" title="Weather Report (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure)" nonfiltered="888" processed="878" dbindex="1480894">



Weather Report is a fictional character from the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Weather or Wes is one of Jolyne's allies in Part 6.



Story.
First introduced as suffering from amnesia, Weather aided Jolyne at Emporio's request. Distant and a little naive, he continues to assist Jolyne and her companions from there after. He serves as valuable back up for F.F., causing the sky to rain if she is too dehydrated. After Pucci absorbs Dio's bone, he mysteriously gains a Joestar birthmark. He joins Anasui -at the latter's insistence- in their search for Jolyne. Little is known about him as the story progresses until one of Dio's sons, Donatello Versace, stole his memories from Pucci's jacket. He regains his memories when Donatello's stand, Underworld, returns the disc to him.  

Weather was actually Pucci's long lost twin brother, stolen and replaced from his hospital bed by a women disappointed by her own sickly child. He was therefore raised separately from his brother, living an average, some-what poor life. While he was working part-time in a restaurant, Weather (known by his adopted name, Wes) stopped a thief by throwing cans at him, smashing a window and nailing the thief in the process. The women's purse that he had saved belonged to Belladonna Pucci, Enrico's younger sister. The two dated afterwards and even became sexually intimate. 

His happiness was short lived when Enrico hired a group of KKK-like men to attack him. Unfortunately, Belladonna was with him at the time, and the couple was savagely beaten. Unconscious and near-death, he was unable to prevent his girlfriend from committing suicide. Instead of joining her in death as he desired, he was ironically saved by the Stand creating Arrowtip that Dio had thrown. Bitter to his untimely savior, he first tried to commit suicide several times (some of which include shooting himself in the head, throwing himself off a cliff, drowning) only to be saved by his Stand time and time again. Vengeful, he turned to assaulting his attackers and was successful in killing the leader of the KKK group. Eventually, he tracked Pucci down as the man who had hired his demise. Before the fight had begun, Pucci ripped Weather's memory from him. Knowing that he (Pucci) didn't have the power to kill him, he had Weather arrested for the murders he had committed (one of which he was framed for as Belladonna's) and left him to rot in prison.

With his memories returned to him, Weather renewed his thirst for vengeance on Pucci. Anasui, demanding that they shift their focus on finding Jolyne, relented when he heard Weather's resolution. Weather felt that he was on his death bed and didn't want anyone else to join him. He wasn't afraid to face death, feeling cheated from death for the last thirty years. With the birthmarks, Weather hunted Enrico easily and the brothers finally fought. Although the fight was obviously in Weather's favor, Jolyne crashed a car nearby distracting Weather from the finishing blow. Pucci used this chance of weakness to stab Weather through the heart with his hand. In his last moments, he was able to wrestle his Stand disk away from Pucci, a gift he left for Jolyne. 

His vengeance was ultimately delivered when Emporio used Weather's Stand to defeat Pucci.

Personality.
When deprived from his memories, Weather was mellow and unfazed by close distances to people. He would boldly stand a few inches next to Jolyne's face to get her attention. He was trustworthy and compassionate, rescuing those in need without caring for his own safety. Unless someone he knew was in danger, Weather hardly panicked.

Upon his memories return, he reveals his true sinister colors. While still retaining his previous passion for his friends, he isn't afraid to flaunt his powers for his own amusement. Smiling when he shocks unsuspecting victims or even skipping in joy amongst his hazardous rainbows, Weather's newer personality frightened Anasui. His melancholy over his memories soon consumes him and drives him to settle things with Pucci.

Stand.

Weather Report (          wez  rip to): a versatile Stand that has control over weather. His stand is usually in a cloud humanoid shape. His stand can quickly formulate these vapors to stop or distort his enemies attacks, rivaling Star Platinum's speed in bullet catching. He can also use his Stand to bring otherwise unlikely elements of the weather to rain down on enemies. In such a case, he used poisonous frogs to protect Jolyne against Pucci. He can also instantly freeze liquids at the single touch.

Heavy Weather Report: When Weather restores his memories, his stand regained several abilities previously lost to it. In addition to the abilities stated above, his stand could create projections of rainbows to fill a vicinity. If someone were to graze their body against them, their bodies would morph into a snail, rendering them weak to salt and practically immobile. He can also electrocute anyone who comes in contact with his body. His stand can fill a room completely full with oxygen, paralyzing an opponent indefinitely.

Trivia.
 His real name, if he had stayed with the Pucci family, could have possibly been Domenico Pucci. ;
 At first, Weather was going to be the only male companion to Jolyne. However, this was changed when Anasui's character switched genders.
 As with everyone else, Weather has a Steel Ball Run counterpart at the end of Part 6, appearing as an unnamed hitchhiker. ;

<doc id="5735731" title="The Trap (Code Lyoko episode)" nonfiltered="889" processed="879" dbindex="1480895">
"The Trap" is the fourteenth episode of the French animated television series Code Lyoko.  It premiered in France on December 3, 2003 and in the United States on May 6, 2004.

 Summary .

A year after first discovering the supercomputer and Aelita, the group decides to throw a surprise party for the virtual girl. Sissi catches wind of the party, and follows Ulrich and Yumi to the Factory. On the way there, XANA possesses the abandoned manufacturing plant as a whole. Jeremie and Odd are the first to arrive at the Factory, finding the elevator to be inoperable. They head off to find the fuse box. Once Ulrich and Yumi arrive there, Sissi confronts them about it. They tell her to leave, but XANA's earlier possession allows him to trap all three in the elevator and drop them to the bottom of the shaft. Sissi and Yumi come out without injury, but Ulrich's arm is broken in the fall. Meanwhile, Jeremie and Odd have to deal with the possessed Factory equipment.

 Recap .



The episode begins in the Factory.  In the paper and wire-strewn executive office area (seen from the front of the Factory, that "ship's bow" full of bay windows), odd happenings are going on.  In the computer control room, an entire wall of monitors that haven't been activated in years suddenly flash to life, each one displaying the Eye of XANA.  In the room containing the Assembly Line below the Factory Floor the conveyor belts begin moving and various plugs, cranes and automated drills come to life.

It is night at Kadic Junior High School and Jeremie is talking to Aelita via his desktop computer.  He tells Aelita that it is her 'first birthday', explaining that it's been one year since they first discovered her and Lyoko -- the "birth" of their friendship.  Jim can be heard yelling at Odd and Ulrich in the hallway, asking if they're asleep. Realizing that Jim might yell at him too, Jeremie stops his work and gets to bed. 

Later the next day, Jeremie proposes that they throw a party for Aelita.  Ulrich and Yumi go to the Factory early, not realizing that Sissi, suspicious about their activities, has followed them. She confronts them on the Factory Floor and gets into the Factory Lift with them, which unexpectedly closes and traps them inside. The lift falls at rapid speed before finally stopping in the shaft a long way below the Lab. Ulrich's arm is broken in the fall, and Sissi is knocked out cold.  Ulrich is conscious and tells Yumi to use the shaft's maintenance ladder in order to reach the Lab.  As Yumi begins her ascent, she comments that she has a slight fear of heights. 

Jeremie and Odd arrive at the Factory and find the lift is not working. They take an alternate route through the machine rooms in the forefront of the Factory.  As the two descend the steps into the Assembly Line (cleverly shut down by XANA so that it looks inactive), Odd comments in wonder that he forgot what the machine rooms looked like.  Jeremie contemptuously calls the rusting machines pieces of junk.  Suddenly, the mechanical contraptions activate and attempt to kill the two.  A robotic plug on tractor treds picks up Jeremie by his shirt and deposits him a conveyor belt that ends with a mechanical crusher.  Odd rescues Jeremie, but is put on the conveyor belt by another automated plug.  He sees a ceiling crane running along its track.  Once positioned overhead, the plug comes down rapidly and tries to crush Odd's face.  Odd parries with a metal rod, which the plug wrenches out of his hands.  After escaping the conveyor belt with his friend's help, Odd and Jeremie evacuate the Assembly Line. They run for the Turbine Room, which is on the way to the Lab. Jeremie sees an excess amount of steam emitting from the boilers and sees them shaking and rumbling ominously.  The genious suspects the boilers are also part of the trap.  Odd asks Jeremie if he's good at running.  Jeremie replies by saying "I'm better at math than gym."  Odd says, "Math isn't going to help you here."  The two make a run for it and miraculously make it to the other side of the chamber before the boilers rupture and detonate, spewing shrapenel and steam that would have otherwise killed the two boys. 

After running the gauntlet they make it to the Lab. Jeremie sends Odd to the Scanner Room through a hatch in the floor, and transfers, scans and virtualizes him into Lyoko. Yumi makes it up to the Lab seconds later, and Jeremie sends her to Lyoko as well.   

In the lift, Sissi has awoken and is frightened. Ulrich comforts her, and she binds his broken arm in a sling, asking if she is a good nurse.  But as soon as the two start a conversation, water has started to leak into the lift shaft through a crack in the wall.  It enters the lift, gradually filling it up. Ulrich tries to hold the ceiling hatch closed, but finds it impossible with his broken arm and cannot stop the flow.  Under great strain, he lets go and allows the lift to flood. 

On Lyoko, Odd and Yumi destroy the attacking monsters with a barrage of laser arrows and Japanese war fan.  The two manage to get Aelita to the Tower just in time.  Aelita deactivates it as Ulrich and Sissi are about to drown, and Jeremie activates a time reversion. 

Back in the past, Jeremie, Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi are in Jeremie's Dormitory, crowded around Jeremie's computer. Aelita is on the screen, wondering what this is about. They reveal a cake with a single candle on it to celebrate Aelita's birthday. 

Sissi, Hervé, and Nicolas sneak to the open door to Jeremie's dorm to watch.  Aelita asks what is going on and is confused.  Yumi says they're sending her something from their world.  Jeremie holds up a birthday cake to the still-confused Aelita and the group says in chorus "Happy Birthday, Aelita!" Amid the festivities, Ulrich notices Sissi at the door and she tries to hide.  Ulrich, remembering her kindness before the time reversion, smiles at Sissi. Hervé comments to Nicolas, saying that it is idiotic to celebrate a computer's birthday.  Sissi, pleased by Ulrich's reaction to her presence, declares birthdays for inanimate objects a good idea, and tells Hervé and Nicholas to get a cake for tomorrow to celebrate the birthday of her make-up kit. 


 Memorable Quotes .

Aelita: And am I supposed to do something?
Odd: Yeah! Save me a piece of cake!
Yumi: One track mind!
Jeremie: Don't listen to that glutton.
Odd: Speak for yourself four-eyes!
Yumi: Calm down you guys! ;

Sissi:(After seeing the cake for Aelita) Well, I think it's a great idea!

Odd: Too bad this isn't Lyoko... at least I have super powers THERE ! ;

Ulrich: I swear, if we get out of here alive, I promise to be nicer to you in the future, Sissi.

 Trivia .

Escaping the Elevator.
In the elevator, Sissi and Ulrich could have floated on top of the water, something most people can do, especially ones with access to Kadic's pool. It could've worked even with Ulrich's broken arm. This way, they could have escaped the elevator and avoided drowning. (Although Ulrich would've needed Sissi's help to climb through the hatch.)
 Cinematic Notes .

 At one point, Jeremie tells Yumi that her point loss is too high, but Odd is the only one getting hit with enemy fire.
 During the battle on Lyoko, Jeremie reads that Yumi's lifepoint count is 10 and that Aelita's is 80. Aelita had used her creativity prior to this count, meaning that she would have had less than 80 lifepoints.

He studied under Drolling, a sound but second-rate artist, and carried off the Prix de Rome in 1850 by his picture of Zenobia found on the banks of the Araxes. His talent from the first revealed itself as strictly academical, full of elegance and grace, but somewhat lacking originality. In the course of his residence in Italy Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of Correggio, as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the Salon of 1857, which were purchased for the Luxembourg: The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child. His Leda, St John the Baptist, and a Portrait of Beul, exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being The Pearl and the Wave. Once only did he attempt an historical picture, Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat (1861); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: Guizot, Charles Gamier, Edmond About. 

]The works that crowned Baudrys reputation were his mural decorations, which show much imagination and a high artistic gift for color, as may be seen. in the frescoes in the Paris Court of Cassation. at the château of Chantilly, and some private residences the Hôtel Fould and Hôtel Paivabut, above all, in the decorations of the foyer of the Opera Garnier. These, more than thirty paintings in all, and among them compositions figurative of dancing and music, occupied the painter for ten years. Baudry was a member of the Institut de France, succeeding Jean-Victor Schnetz. Two of his colleagues, Dubois and Marius Jean Mercié, co-operating with his brother, Baudry the architect, erected a monument to him in Paris (1890). The statue of Baudry at La Roche-sur-Yonne (1897) by Grôme.

Frank Edward Wilson (11 April, 1924 - 24 October, 2005) was an Australian film, stage and television actor; musical comedy singer and director; and television game show and variety host.

Early life.
Frank Wilson was born in 1924 in the Melbourne suburb of Northcote.  He left school at the age of 13.  In 1943, he joined the Australian Army, where he served as a Signalman in Borneo and Papua New Guinea until his discharge in 1945.

He began acting in 1948, when he appeared at Melbourne's Tivoli theatre.

Career.
His best known film appearances were in The Club (by David Williamson; a role that Wilson had created on stage), Crackerjack, Breaker Morant, and Black Robe.  He also appeared in the 1956 Charlie Chaplin film A King in New York.  On television he appeared in Changi (mini-series written by John Doyle), SeaChange, Blue Heelers, Water Rats, Power Without Glory, A Country Practice, Bellbird and other programs.

His stage work included Guys and Dolls, Wonderful Town, Lola Montez, Damn Yankees, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (which he directed), and as Falstaff in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2.  

David Williamson wrote the character of Frank in Travelling North for Wilson, having admired his interpretation of Jock Riley in The Club.  However, after creating Frank on stage, Wilson was not given the role in the film adaptation - it went to Leo McKern instead.

<doc id="9120587" title="SpaceBall (game)" nonfiltered="903" processed="892" dbindex="1480909">
This article is about the phone game.  For other uses, see Spaceball.;
SpaceBall was a miniature video game appearing on several models of LG brand mobile phones.  The game was similar in concept to Snake, a title that was packaged with many Nokia brand cellular phones.

The cartoonish title scenes and cut screens featured the title character drawn in the Anime style.

Object.
The object of the game was to guide a small animal, the head of which resembled a rabbit with the horn of a unicorn, around a playing field gathering colored  balls.  The player had a set amount of time to clear the board without running into itself or a wall, or letting itself grow too long.  If a player did any of these, or ran out of time, he lost a life (referred to as a "fail" in the game) and had to restart the level from the beginning.  Failing three times ended the game; no extra lives were offered at any point in the game.

Levels.
Each of the game's twenty levels grew progressively harder.  The first level simply contained an open field, of which the character could leave one side and re-enter the screen immediately on the other.  Later levels introduced borders around the field to prevent such exit and re-entry; walls, blocks, and other obstacles in the middle of the screen; and finally all-out mazes with narrow paths that strictly limited the animal's range of motion.

Rules.
A level always began with three red segments attached to the creature's head.  Eating any red balls with only these segments attached would not cause the animal to grow.  Eating any other colored ball caused it to attach as a segment to the tail end of the creature, as did eating a red ball with segments of any other color already on the animal.

A player could clear segments off of the animal by attaching three balls of the same color to its tail.  This could be done by simply eating three of the same color in a row, or by eating one or two of one color, eating three of another (clearing them), then eating a third (or a second and a third) of the original color.  The importance of shortening the body was twofold: a longer creature ran a more dangerous risk of running into itself and dying immediately; also, if a player cleared the board while the character's body was too long (indicated by a number in the corner of the screen), the player failed (lost a life) and had to restart the level.

Bonus balls.
Occasionally, a flashing bonus ball appeared on the playing screen.  This ball was white with a red dot in the middle, and its appearance was marked by the player's phone vibrating.  If the animal ate the bonus ball, one of four random effects would occur:
 The timer resetting to full;
 The character's tail resetting to three red segments;
 All remaining balls on the field changing to the color of the last one eaten;
 All balls changing color and position.

Two of these bonus balls appeared per life, per level.

The first iron side ship.

It is often stated that ironclad warships were a product of the American Civil War.  Most maritime historians are aware of the powerful iron hulled H.M.S. Warrior of 1860.  While this ship is often given credit as the first iron hulled ocean going warships, another ship lies overlooked in history seventeen years before, though it never sailed the oceans.

Out of the United States- Canadian tensions of the 1830's came a growing demand for the United States Navy to reestablish a presence on the Great Lakes to protect U.S. interests in the region.  Though the Navy had a presence on the Lakes in both previous wars with Britain, all of the warships possessed at the end of the War of 1812 had either returned to merchant service, or had been sunk to preserve them.  When it was learned that the Canadians were building two war steamers, many in the region were alarmed.  One of these, the Minos, was reported as having sides that were over two feet thick, and strapped with iron, making her impervious to small cannon shot.

An amendment to a fortifications bill provided for a U.S. steamer for the defense of Lake Erie.  This was to be a modern ship, to challenge the Canadians.  Upshur stated in a letter to concerned congressmen that, "I am determined to build this vessel of iron instead of wood for two reasons... I was desirous to aid in... developing and applying to a new use the immense resources to ascertain the utility of building vessels of so cheap and indestructible material.  "All of the vessel's hull and engines were made and assembled at the Stackhouse and Tomlinson Iron Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, far from blue water.  After making sure all the parts fit, the hull was disassembled and shipped overland to Erie, Pennsylvania, and then re-erected on the ways.  The new ship was christened USS Michigan, and she was launched on 4 December 1863.  The ship was propelled by a set of paddle wheels, 21 feet in diameter.  

The paddle wheel houses were decorated with a large carving of an eagle and shield.  The engine had two cylinders, both of which had a 36 inch bore and eight foot stroke.  Two boilers consumed the ship's 120 tons of coal to obtain 330 horsepower.  The ship also carried three masts and was rigged as a barkentine for open lake sailing.  On trials, under engine alone, the ship made ten and a half statute miles an hour.  A full crew consisted of 106 officers and men.  

As originally designed, the ship could have carried bow and stern pivot guns and twelve broadside guns.  The tensions with Canada having eased by her launching, she was restricted by treaty to one 18 pounder cannon, which was placed on her forward pivot.  During the Civil War however, the treaty was politely disregarded and she was equipped with a 30 pounder Parrott Rifle, five 20 pounder Parrot Rifles, six 24 pounder smoothbores, and two 12 pounder boat howitzers.

She would never fire a shot in anger, but she was rammed by pirates on Lake Huron, became embroiled in the assassination of a Mormon leader, and ultimately arrested the Irishmen that had tried to take over Canada to hold it hostage for their native land.   But for the most part, she was involved in surveys and assisting vessels in distress.  With the start of the Civil War in 1861, the Michigan 's duties increased.  She would  become an important logistics link, ferrying would-be sailors from east coast ports between Buffalo and western Lake Erie ports where they boarded trains for Cairo, Illinois, and the fleet on the Mississippi River.  She also spent time at anchor, guarding the Confederate prisoners on Johnson's Island.  Two attempts were made by the Confederates to capture this vessel and wreak havoc on the midwestern states.  One was successful in capturing two US Merchant Ships in Canada.  Neither group would gain the decks of the Michigan however, and she remained untested in combat.

In 1905 she was renamed Wolverine, to free her original name for a new battleship.  In 1909, when she was taken on trials she was still able to obtain ten miles an hour.  At the age of seventy, she was given the honor of towing the original U.S.S. Niagara, which had been raised and rebuilt, on a great lakes tour.  In August of 1923, while on a cruise with the Pennsylvania Naval Militia, a connecting rod broke, ending her active career.

Despite the earlier personal pleas of President and former Navy man Franklin Delano Roosevelt, she was scrapped in 1949.  Her prow was given to the city of Erie, Pennsylvania, and was set in concrete and put on display in Wolverine Park just off the foot of State Street in Erie. 

On February 26, 1998, the prow was moved to its new home on the First Mezzanine Level of the Erie Maritime Museum.  The prow underwent an extensive restoration that included welding, scraping, painting, and refitting of her scrollwork.

 U.S.S. Wolverine (II) .

The name Wolverine was re-used on the large commercial side-wheeler steamship Seeandbee when she was converted into a training aircraft carrier in 1942, honoring the original vessel.  A unique ship herself, the second Wolverine was one of two coal-fired side-wheel aircraft carriers in history, and sailed Lake Michigan as a landing trainer for pilots from Glenview Naval Air Station.  Sailing Lake Michigan, they provided flight decks on which hundreds of student aviators qualified for carrier landings and many flight deck crews received their first practical experience in handling aircraft aboard ship.  After World War II, this ship was declared surplus and scrapped.

<doc id="4126676" title="Rugby union in Scotland" nonfiltered="912" processed="901" dbindex="1480918">

Rugby union is a popular team sport in Scotland.

The national side today competes in the annual Six Nations Championship and has appeared at every Rugby World Cup. Professional clubs compete in the Celtic League and the European Cup and a national league for amateur and semi-pro clubs also thrives.

History.

 

The world's oldest continual rugby fixture was first played in 1858 between Merchiston Castle School and the former pupils of The Edinburgh Academy. The Edinburgh Academy was also involved in the first ever international rugby union game when a side representing England met the Scottish national side on the cricket field of the Academy at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh on March 27, 1871, which Scotland won.

Governing body.


The governing body of the game in Scotland is the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU), who operate the national team.

Competitions.

Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but the dawn of professionalism changed the way in which the game was structured.  Previously there had been a domestic league that covered the country, the top division of which was essentially the elite of club rugby in Scotland.  This league was established in the early 1970s to replace the complicated "unofficial championship" that had been competed for previously. Starting in 1973-74 season, the clubs were organised into a league of six divisions.

The league that was established in the early 1970s does still operate though and is currently sponsored by the BT Group plc, making it known as the BT League Championship, which is split into a Premiership level of three divisions and a National League of ten divisions over five levels.  This league contains Scottish rugby union's traditional big name clubs, such as Melrose R.F.C. and Hawick R.F.C..

Below the League Championship, there are also a number of District Leagues in operation.  These are the Edinburgh and District; Glasgow and District; Caledonia - North District; and Caledonia - Highland District.  Scotland is also home to the oldest organised rugby union league in the world, the Southern Reporter Border League, which was formed in 1901.

When professionalism was introduced, and the Heineken Cup created for clubs across Europe the SRU decided that the existing clubs operating in the Scottish league were not competitive enough.  They therefore decided to create professional clubs to compete in the Celtic League, a competition featuring Scottish, Welsh and Irish sides, to ensure that Scotland had fairly competitive sides operating in the European competition and to drive up standards of rugby in the country.  Three of these sides are in operation today, the Glasgow Warriors; Edinburgh; and the Border Reivers.

Popularity.

Unlike in Wales, rugby union is not the national sport in Scotland. It certainly comes second after football, and possibly is lower than that.  The sport is more widely played than the sport rugby league which despite being very popular in the North of England, has not found wide popularity north of the border.  It is most popular in the border region, where it is played universally.  In the rest of the country it tends to be the preserve of private schools, although not exclusively so.  Despite not being so popular in the West of Scotland, the domestic league has been dominated in recent years by a Glasgow based club, the Hawks.

Whilst attendances at club matches in Scotland are fairly poor (certainly by comparison to football or to the attendances at club matches in neighbouring England or Wales) the national team draws a sizeable crowd, especially for the Six Nations matches.  Indeed, despite football generally being more popular than rugby in Scotland, Murrayfield is considerably larger than Hampden Park, the Scottish national football team's home ground, with space to hold around 15,000 extra spectators.

Statistics.

According to the IRB Scotland has 242 rugby union clubs; 350 referees; 54,000 pre-teen male players; 10,000 teen male players; 10,000 senior male players (total male players 74,000) as well as 23,000 pre-teen female players; 500 teen female players; 750 senior female players (total female players 24,250).

Demographics.

Rugby union is particularly popular in the Borders region.

Current trends.
The national team.


The first international rugby union match in the world was played between England and Scotland in Edinburgh in 1871. Scotland won 4-1.  The national side is considered by the IRB to belong in the top tier of nations, although they are not as competitive as the elite sides such as New Zealand or South Africa. They usually play their home matches at Murrayfield Stadium in the West End of Edinburgh.

Scotland contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the Six Nations Championship.

Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from Scotland as well as England, Ireland and Wales.

He is also a member of BSA's National Executive Board and the board of BSA's Mount Diablo Silverado Council. Much of that work is aimed at increasing minority involvement in Scouting.

Chuck is also a great speaker having the ability to inspire his audiences. Very recently he came to the University of San Francisco MBA Alumni Society Luncheon Series and gave a wonderful talk, covering not only the future of the Telecom industry but also business ethics and his vision for the future of the University. There was also a big surprise during the speech, when he announced his retirement for the first time in public! You can listen to the entire speech at The MBA Podcast.

Komt tie dan hè! is a humorous gabber track by DJ Norman vs Dark Raver released March 9 2005. The title of the track is based on a typical catchphrase in Dutch from DJ Dark Raver. The track plays with the expectation of the listener that is desperately waiting for the distorted gabber beat to kick in. 
The more commercial version of the track, that includes bubbling influences, reached the 4th place in the Dutch charts.

The Costa Rica Institute of Technology or Technological Institute of Costa Rica (Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica), also known as "ITCR" or "TEC", is a public educational institute in Cartago, Costa Rica. It has the mission of: "Contributing to the integral development of the country, by means of the formation of human resources, research and extension; keeping the scientific-technical leadership, the academic excellence and the strict attachment to the ethical, environmental and humanists norms, from a state university perspective of quality and competitiveness at national and international level".

The Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (TEC) is a national autonomous institution of higher education, dedicated to the teaching, research and extension in technology and associated sciences aimed at the development of Costa Rica. It was created by Law No.  4777 on June, 10, 1971. Its main campus is in Cartago, Costa Rica, 24 km east of San José, Costa Rica, the capital of the country.

The TEC offers both undergraduate and graduate studies in a wide range of fields, including engineering (construction, industrial production, electronics, industrial maintenance), computer science and business management.

History.

Recent Political Views.

By February 2006 the academic and student union authorities of the Institute had voiced frank opposition (http://www.semanario.ucr.ac.cr/de_la_u/articulos.htm) to the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA or TLC, Tratado de Libre Comercio) pending of discussion at the Legislative Assembly and already approved in Dominican Republic and the rest of Central America. 
Noteworthily, organized students from the TEC played an important role in the Protests of the Combo, in 2000, when massive and sustained uprisings of most various sectors from the civil society managed to overthrow a law already approved by the Assembly's two biggest party fractions, those of the PLN (National Liberation Party) and the PUSC (Social Christian Unity Party). During the protests of the Combo students from the TEC blocked many times the main road from Cartago to San José, doing as many over the nation's roads, following the example of the first onion and potato peasants who barricaded the Florencio del Castillo highway (linking San José to Cartago) in protest against the government of Miguel Rodriguez's neoliberal policies that in their view were ruining them (by lowering taxes on importation of heavily subsidized, foreign competing goods).

U.S. Route 350 is a northeast-southwest United States highway, signed as east-west.  Though it is only 80 miles (129 km) long, and entirely within the state of Colorado, it is a vital corridor in the isolated region. Its history predates the 1926 creation of the numbered US highway system -- the route parallels part of the Mountain Branch of the historic Santa Fe Trail.

Termini.
As of 2004, the highway's eastern terminus is in La Junta, Colorado at an intersection with U.S. Highway 50.  Its western terminus is east of Trinidad, Colorado at an intersection with U.S. Highway 160.

Historic termini.
Until the 1990s, US 350 continued on into Trinidad, where it intersected with Interstate 25 -- and before I-25, with U.S. Highway 85/U.S. Highway 87.

States traversed.
The highway passes only through Colorado.

Wotsits is a brand of cheese puffs sold by Walkers. The most common form are cheese flavoured curly shapes. However over the years various other shapes (such as waffle-shaped Wotsits) and flavours (such as prawn cocktail and BBQ beef) have also been sold.  The brand name occurs in the singular, "Wotsit", referring to an individual corn puff.  Like many such names, it is an allusion to a common word, in this case the slang term "", to which it is phonetically identical.  Wotsits packaging often come with a joke or trivia section on the back.

The brand was previously owned by Golden Wonder, but was sold off separately to Walkers when Golden Wonder changed hands in 2002. Prior to this, Walkers sold a rival known as Cheetos on the UK market.

In 2003, the advertising agency, Abbott Mead Vickers, made a public apology when the Parliamentary Select Committee on Health brought to light a private brief that it had made to Frito-Lay (Walkers' owners) where it proposed encouraging children (4 to 9 years old) to believe that  Wotsits are for me   I'm going to buy them when I get the chance and pester Mum for them when she next goes shopping. .

Another variety of Wotsits were "Mealtime Potato Shapes", made from potato and cheese and meant to be baked in the oven. They were launched in 2000. Mealtime Potato Shapes have been discontinued for many years.

The bloater (Coregonus hoyi) is a freshwater fish native to the Great Lakes. It is silver in color with a pink and purple iridescence and reaches an average length of 9 inches (23cm).

In British cuisine, the bloater is, like the kipper, a type of smoked herring, but is differentiated from the kipper by the fact that fish is smoked whole, with its innards intact. According to George Orwell in The Road to Wigan Pier, the Emperor Charles V erected a statue to the inventor of bloaters.

 For Chinese footballer, See Yan Song (footballer) 
Yan Song1 (Chinese:   ; pinyin: Yán S ng) (1481 - 1568) was a corrupt Ming Chinese prime minister who became a homeless pauper.
 courtesy name ( ): Weizhong (  );
 pseudonym ( ): Jiexi (  );

Born in Fenyi (  ), Jiangsu province, Yan was skilled in poetry and whose works are in The Collection at Ling Mountain House (     Lingshantang Ji).

Yan Song was the prime minister who had served under the emperor Jia Jing. He and his son Yan Shi Fan had dominated court politics with the tacit consent of the fatuous monarch who shirked his responsibilites as emperor and devoted much of his time to sensual pleasures and Taoist practices. Under Yan Song, the nation fell into an era of moral decadence and corruption, where righteous officers were sidelined and the Ming national strength fell rapidly. Yan Song's wealth is said to be so rich that it is said to be comparable to that of the emperor. However, his corruption and treachery had also raise the indignation of righteuos officers and created many political opponents. Yan Song was finally disgraced at his later years and died of poverty not long after that while his son the infamous Yan Shi Fan was executed for his crimes.

He was the subject of the Chinese opera called Beating Yan Song (    D  Yán S ng).

Linley Halt was a small railway station on the Severn Valley line in Shropshire, England. The single siding accessed by means of a ground frame was taken out of use in December 1957. The siding connected with the running line with a trailing connection in the up direction. The station closed in 1963 under the Beeching axe.

The station was built at the behest of Thomas C. Whitmore of Apley Park Estate. Apley House lies on the opposite bank of the River Severn to the station.

Table Mountain is a flat-topped mountain forming a prominent landmark overlooking the city of Cape Town in South Africa. It is a significant tourist attraction, with many visitors using the cableway to take a ride to the top. The mountain forms part of the Table Mountain National Park.

 Features .
The main feature of Table Mountain is a level plateau approximately 3 km from side to side, surrounded by steep cliffs.  The plateau, flanked by Devil's Peak to the east and by Lion's Head to the west, forms a dramatic backdrop to Cape Town and its Table Bay harbour, and together with Signal Hill form the natural amphitheatre of the City Bowl. 

The highest point on Table Mountain is towards the eastern end of the plateau and is marked by Maclear's Beacon, a stone cairn built in 1865 by Sir Thomas Maclear for trigonometrical survey. It is 1,086 m (3,563 ft) above sea level, about 19 m higher than the cable station at the western end of the plateau.

The cliffs of the main plateau are split by Platteklip Gorge ("Flat Stone Gorge"), which provides an easy and direct ascent to the summit and was the route taken by Antonio de Saldanha on the first recorded ascent of the mountain in 1503. 

The flat top of the mountain is often covered by cloud spilling over the top to form the "table cloth". 

Table Mountain is at the northern end of a sandstone mountain range that forms the spine of the Cape Peninsula. To the south of the main plateau is a lower part of the range called the Back Table. On the Atlantic coast of the peninsula, the range is known as the Twelve Apostles. The range continues southwards to Cape Point.

 Geology .

The upper part of the mountain mesa consists of Ordovician quartzitic sandstone, commonly referred to as Table Mountain Sandstone (TMS), which is highly resistant to erosion and forms characteristic steep grey crags. Below the sandstone is a layer of micaceous basal shale, which weathers quite readily and is therefore not readily visible. The basement consists of heavily folded and altered late precambrian Malmesbury shale, which has been intruded by Cape Granite. The basement rocks are not nearly as resistant to weathering as the TMS but significant outcrops of the Cape Granite are visible on the western side of Lion's Head.

 Flora .

The main vegetation of the mountain is the unique and rich Cape fynbos. An estimated 1,470 species of plants are found on the mountain and amongst them are many kinds of proteas. Remnant patches of indigenous forest persist in a few of the wetter ravines but not on the more exposed face above the city, where conditions there are too dry and harsh for forests. The mountain has also suffered serious invasions of alien plants for well over a century, with perhaps the worst invader being the cluster pine. Considerable efforts have been made to eliminate these alien plants.

 Fauna .
The most common animal on the mountain is the dassie, or rock hyrax. They especially cluster around the upper cable station, near the sources of junk food. There are also porcupines, mongooses, snakes and tortoises. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountain until perhaps the 1920's but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the rooikat (caracal) and the vaalboskat (also called the vaalkat or African Wild Cat) were once common on the mountain. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain.

Himalayan tahrs, fugitive descendants of tahrs that escaped from Groote Schuur zoo in 1936, used to be common on the less accessible upper parts of the mountain. As an exotic species, they were eradicated through a culling programme initiated by the South African National Parks to make way for the reintroduction of indigenous klipspringers. Until recently there were also small numbers of fallow deer of European origin and sambar deer from southeast Asia. These were mainly in the Rhodes Memorial area but during the 1960's they could be found as far afield as Signal Hill. The animals may by now have been eliminated or relocated.

 History .
Between 1896 and 1907, five dams, the Woodhead, Hely-Hutchinson, De Villiers, Alexandria and Victoria reservoirs, were opened on the Back Table to supply Cape Town's water needs. A ropeway ascending from Camps Bay via Kasteelspoort ravine was used to ferry materials and manpower (the anchor points at the old top station can still be seen). There is a well-preserved steam locomotive from this period housed in the Waterworks Museum at the top of the mountain near the Hely-Hutchinson dam. It had been used to haul materials for the dam across the flat top of the mountain. Cape Town's water requirements have since far outpaced the capacity of the dams and they are no longer an important part of the water supply.

The mountain became part of the new Cape Peninsula National Park in the 1990s. The park was renamed to the Table Mountain National Park in 1998.

In 2006, a devastating fire ran through the mountain, destroying large amounts of vegetation and resulting in the death of a tourist. A charge of arson and culpable homicide was laid against a British man who was suspected of starting the blaze.

 Cableway .

The Table Mountain Cableway takes passengers from the lower cable station on Tafelberg Road, about 302 m above sea level, to the plateau at the top of the mountain. The upper cable station offers views overlooking Cape Town, Table Bay and Robben Island to the north, and the Atlantic seaboard to the west and south.

Construction of the cableway was first started in 1926, and the cableway was officially opened in 1929. In 1997, the cableway was extensively upgraded, and new cars were introduced carrying 65 instead of 25 passengers. The new cars give a faster journey to the summit, and rotate through 360 degrees during the ascent or descent, giving a panoramic view over the city.

The top cable station offers viewpoints, curio shops, a restaurant and walking trails of various lengths.

 Activities .


 Hiking .
Hiking on Table Mountain is popular amongst locals and tourists, and a number of trails of varying difficulty are available. Because of the steep cliffs around the summit, direct ascents from the city side are limited. Platteklip Gorge, a prominent gorge up the centre of the main table, is a popular and straightforward direct ascent to the summit.

Longer routes to the summit go via the Back Table, a lower area of Table Mountain to the South of the main plateau. From the Southern Suburbs side, the Nursery Ravine and Skeleton Gorge routes start at Kirstenbosch. The route via Skeleton Gorge to Maclears Beacon is known as Smuts Track in memory of Jan Smuts, who was a keen hiker. The Bridle Path, or Jeep Track, makes a more gradual ascent from Constantia Nek along the road used to service the dams on Back Table. There are many other paths in popular walking ares on the lower slopes of the mountain accessed from Constantia Nek, Cecilia Forest, Kirstenbosch, Newlands Forest and Rhodes Memorial.

On the Atlantic side, the most popular ascent is Kasteelspoort, a gorge overlooking Camps Bay, while the Pipe Track is a level route popular with walkers.

The Hoerikwaggo Trails are four hiking trails on Table Mountain ranging from two to six days, operated by South African National Parks.

 Rock climbing .
Rock climbing on Table Mountain is a very popular pastime. There are well-documented climbing routes of varying degrees of difficulty up the many faces of the mountain. Only traditional climbing is allowed on Table Mountain; no bolting can be done. Commercial groups offer abseiling from the upper cable station.

 Caving .
Most of the world's important caves occur in limestone but Table Mountain is unusual amongst speleologists for having several large sandstone cave systems. The biggest systems are the Wynberg Caves, located on the Back Table, not far from the Jeep Track in ridges overlook Orange Kloof and Hout Bay. 

 "Mensa" constellation .
Table Mountain is the only terrestrial feature to give its name to a constellation   Mensa, meaning The Table.  The constellation is seen in the Southern Hemisphere, below Orion, around midnight in mid-July. It was named by the French astronomer Nicolas de Lacaille during his stay at the Cape in the mid eighteenth century.

HMAS Yarra (U77), the second ship to bear that name, was a Grimsby class sloop of the Royal Australian Navy that served during World War II. Yarra was laid down by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales 24 May 1934, launched 28 March 1935 by Mrs Parkhill, wife of Archdale Parkhill, Minister for Defence and commissioned 21 January 1936.

Early on 4 March 1942, HMAS Yarra, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Robert William Rankin RAN, was escorting a convoy near Tjilatjap in the Indian Ocean, South of Java. The Yarra was then attacked by the Japanese cruisers Atago, Takao and Maya accompanied by two destroyers of Destroyer Division 4, Arashi and Nowaki. Commander Rankin ordered the convoy to scatter and turned the Yarra to engage the enemy. Pitched against overwhelming odds, the Yarra defended the convoy for an hour and half, but was then sunk with the loss of 138 of her crew. There were only 13 survivors. It was more than five days before a Dutch submarine rescued the men from the water and took them to Ceylon. 

Australian War Memorial historian Daniel Oakman wrote that the defence mounted by the Yarra was "widely regarded as one of the bravest acts in Australian naval history".

<doc id="2774014" title="Puaiohi" nonfiltered="941" processed="929" dbindex="1480948">


The Puaiohi or Small Kauai Thrush, Myadestes palmeri, is a small, dark solitaire endemic to Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands. It is also known as the Palmer's thrush. The Puaiohi grows up to 7 inches in length. The male and female of the species look similar. The Puaiohi is dark brown above and gray below with pinkish legs. At close range, one can observe a pale eye ring and a dark malar streak. An immature Puaiohi looks similar to an adult above, and is is heavily scallopped brown-on-beige on the breast and parts of the underside.

The song of the Puaiohi is a slurred, whistled trill with upward inflection at the end. The call is a harsh "sher," delivered in short bursts. This bird prefers densely vegetated gulches, frequenting the understory where it often perches motionless in a hunched posture. Like other native Hawaiian thrushes, it quivers its wings and feeds primarily on fruits and insects. Two to three pale greenish-blue eggs with reddish-brown splotches are laid in nests usually placed on mossy cliffs.

This bird is classified as Critically Endangered due to having a small population in an extremely small range. The current population is estimated at between 200 and 300 individuals located in the Alaka i Wilderness Area abouve 3,500 feet. The Puaiohi is, however, making a comeback from the brink of extinction. A captive breeding program has been very successful lately, and the Puaiohi may be even more common now than when it was discovered. Breeding facilities that breed the Puaiohi are located in Olinda on the island of Maui, and on the island of Hawaii. Birds released into the wild from this breeding program have nested almost immediately after their release.

Agaiambo, swamp in Papua New Guinea where a nearly intact Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was rediscovered in 1972. The plane was nicknamed "The Swamp Ghost".

Inhabitants.

Agaiambo or agaumbu, a race of dwarf marsh-dwellers in British New Guinea, now almost extinct.  In his annual report for 1904 the acting administrator of British New Guinea stated that on a visit he paid to their district he saw six males and four females.  The Agaiambo live in huts erected on piles in the lakes and marshes.  Dwarfish in stature but broadly built, they are remarkable for the shortness of their legs.  They live almost entirely in their "dug-outs'"or canoes, or actually wading in the water.  

Their food consists of sago, the roots of the water-lily and fish.  The Agaiambo are believed to have been formerly numerous, but within the last few years have suffered from the raids of their cannibalistic Papuan neighbours.  In features, colour and hair they closely resemble the true Papuans.

The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles of Baron Camden, of Camden Place in the County of Kent (1765), Viscount Bayham (1786), Earl Camden (1786) and Earl of Brecknock (1812), all in the Peerage of Great Britain, except the Earldom of Brecknock which is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The latter title is used as a courtesy title for the Marquess's eldest son and heir apparent.

History.
The Pratt family descends from John Pratt, Lord Chief Justice from 1718 to 1725. His third son from his second marriage, Charles Pratt, was also a prominent lawyer and politician and served as Lord Chancellor between 1766 to 1770. In 1765 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Camden and in 1786 he was further honoured when he was created Viscount Bayham and Earl Camden. His son, the second Earl, was a politician and notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as Lord President of the Council. In 1812 he was created Earl of Brecknock and Marquess Camden. His son, the second Marquess, represented Ludgershall, Bath and Dunwich in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Brecknockshire. In 1835 Lord Camden was called to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Camden. His son, the third Marquess, briefly sat as a Member of Parliament for Brecon in 1866, before he succeeded his father and took his seat in the House of Lords. On his early death the titles passed to his three-month old son, the fourth Marquess. He was notably Lord Lieutenant of Kent from 1905 to 1943. As of 2006 the peerages are held by his grandson, the sixth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1983.  

The family live at Wherwell House near Andover in Hampshire.

Rosie the Clown Elston (Kingston and the Islands).

Rosie the Clown is the stage name of Laura Elston. She was 46 years old at the time of the election, and had been performing as Rosie in Ottawa and Kingston for fifteen years. She campaigned in a red wig, jumpsuit and face paint, in a novelty candidacy influenced by groups like the defunct Rhinoceros Party of Canada. She announced her candidacy by saying, "I've just been thinking wouldn't it be nice to lighten up just a little bit. The issues are serious, and it's a very momentous time and a difficult time for the world, but I find that when we get too totally stressed out and we take ourselves too seriously, we don't decide well about the serious issues." (Kingston Whig-Standard, 7 June 2004)

Elston was an aide to local Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Flora MacDonald for two years in the 1980s (KWS, 23 June 2004). She received 237 votes (0.44%), finishing sixth against Liberal incumbent Peter Milliken.

Elston should not be confused with Vicki Gabereau, who campaigned for Mayor of Toronto under the pseudonym of clown "Rosie Sunrise" in 1974 (Toronto Star, 23 January 2003).

<doc id="8444301" title="Algorithmics of sudoku" nonfiltered="947" processed="935" dbindex="1480954">
The class of Sudoku puzzles consists of a partially completed row-column grid of cells partitioned into N regions or zones each of size N cells, to be filled in using a prescribed set of N distinct symbols (typically the numbers ), so that each row, column and region contains exactly one of each element of the set. The puzzle can be solved using a variety of algorithms. This page provides algorithms and implementations, when appropriate.

Solving sudokus by backtracking.

The basic backtracking algorithm can be adapted to solve jigsaw sudokus. This is straightforward. Say a zone is a subset of N boxes of an N x N grid, which must contain the numbers from 1 to N. A standard sudoku contains 27 zones, namely 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 squares that are 3 x 3. In a jigsaw sudoku, the square zones are replaced by zones having irregular boundaries, like a jigsaw piece. 

One possible algorithm that uses backtracking to solve such sudokus constructs a graph on  vertices, one vertex for each box of the grid. Two vertices are connected by an edge if there exists a zone containing the two boxes. The problem is then equivalent to coloring this graph with N colors, where adjacent vertices may not have the same color. This is done by starting with an empty assignment of colors (for jigsaw sudokus) and assigning colors to vertices one after another, using some fixed order of the vertices. Whenever a color is being assigned, we check whether it is compatible with the existing assignments, i.e. whether the new color occurs among the neighbors of that vertex. If it doesn't, then we may assign it to the vertex and try to process another vertex. We backtrack once all N colors have been tried for a given vertex. If all vertices have been assigned a color, then we have found a solution. There are of course much more sophisticated algorithms to solve graph coloring. If the sudoku contains initial data, i.e. some boxes have already been filled, then these go into the color assignment before backtracking begins and the vertex sequence includes only the empty boxes.

A Perl implementation in just 86 lines of the above algorithm, which is easily translated into other programming languages, is shown below. It solves a 10x10 jigsaw sudoku that was proposed on Les-Mathematiques.net  A link to the proposal may be found in the section for external links. The first section of the program defines the 10 jigsaw pieces (zones), the second the row and column zones. Thereafter the graph is constructed as an adjacency list. The search procedure prints completed solutions (when all 100 boxes have been assigned). Otherwise it computes the set of colors present among the neighbors of the next vertex to be processed, and recursively tries those assignments that do not conflict with this set. The search starts with an empty assignment.

 Standard Sudoku solver and enumerator .


This section contains a reference implementation and discussion of a modified backtracking algorithm that can be used to create and solve large Sudokus even with modest computing resources. A standard Sudoku is an  Sudoku where  whose zones consist of the rows, columns and  subsquares as in the classic  Sudoku. The example implementation reads the initial state of the Sudoku from standard input and outputs all possible solutions on standard output. 

For example, the example Sudoku shown at right would be entered into a text file, including empty lines and comments:

host> cat wikipedia1.sdk
 wikipedia sudoku;

5 3 . . 7 . . . .
6 . . 1 9 5 . . .
. 9 8 . . . . 6 .
8 . . . 6 . . . 3
4 . . 8 . 3 . . 1
7 . . . 2 . . . 6
. 6 . . . . 2 8 .
. . . 4 1 9 . . 5
. . . . 8 . . 7 9


The solver solves the Sudoku and outputs the solution:

host> ./puzzle-vsort.pl 9 wikipedia1.sdk
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6
9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9
-----------------


The solver will enumerate all possible Sudokus when invoked with an empty input file, as in

host> ./puzzle-vsort.pl 25 /dev/null

 Key modifications to the algorithm .

Conceptually there is one modification only: the backtracking algorithm sorts the vertices by the number of colors already assigned among its neighbors before selecting the next vertex to try. The vertex with the largest number of assigned colors, and hence, the smallest number of choices, is tried first. (There may be more than one such vertex).

The data structures used during the backtracking search are chosen to make this easy and fast, although further optimization is possible. The search state is stored in three data structures: a hash table whose keys are the vertices and whose values are the colors that have been assigned to them. There is an array that contains the vertices that have not yet been assigned a color. Finally, there is a hash table whose keys are again the vertices and whose values are hash tables containing the colors present among the neighbors of the respective vertex, as well as a hint as to who assigned them.

 Discussion of the reference implementation .

The implementation follows this sequence of steps:

 Read the dimensions of the Sudoku from the command line and verify that .
 Provide a routine to map numbers to single-character codes (digits and uppercase letters).
 Create the row and column zones, then create the subsquare zones.
 Construct the adjacency matrix of the graph.
 The search routine:
 Print the solution if there are no more vertices to be assigned a color, and return.
 Sort the remaining vertices in descending order of colors present among their neighbors.
 Pick the/a vertex with the largest number of assigned colors.
 Try each of the remaining possible colors recursively.
 Update the hash table of vertex neighboring colors to reflect the assignment.
 Update the partial solution to reflect the assignment.
 Recurse.
 Remove the color from the partial solution.
 Undo the color assignments from the neighboring colors hash table.
 Before the search begins, read the initial color assignment from standard input (may be empty), skipping comments and empty lines. Assignments are separated by spaces, valid assignments are single-character digit or  letter codes.
 Compute the set of vertices to be assigned a color, i.e. not present in the initial assignment.
 Compute the initial state of the hash table of neighbor colors.
 Start the search.

<doc id="361904" title="Flash suppressor" nonfiltered="951" processed="938" dbindex="1480958">

A flash suppressor, also known as a flash hider, flash guard, flash eliminator, or flash cone, is a device attached to a rifle or other gun that directs hot escaping gases from the barrel end. It reduces the visibility of the brilliant muzzle flash which occurs upon firing to the shooter  and or other individuals. 

Muzzle flash is especially visible at night, making it easy to see the location of the shooter, and at the same time interfering with the shooter's night vision.  It is caused by incandescence of the expanding gases produced by burning gunpowder. Even during the day, the flash obscures the target view. The birdcage hider on the M16 rifle for example, directs the hot gases so they do not go directly up. 

Two common types of flash suppressors are the duckbill and birdcage suppressors. Duckbill flash suppressors have upper and lower "prongs" and directs gas to the sides. Early Mk 43 and some early M16 models featured this type. One disadvantage is that the prongs can get caught on things. Birdcage types still have prongs, but also feature a ring on the front to prevent obstructions from getting caught between the prongs. Another type of flash suppressor is a flash moderator, such as use on some XM177 models. An example of a cone shaped hider is on the Bren machine gun.

Earlier rifle designs from the 19th century tended to have longer barrels than modern rifles. A side effect of the long barrel is that the gunpowder is completely burnt before the bullet leaves the barrel, usually resulting only in a puff of smoke. However if the same weapon is "cut down", as is common in cavalry and jungle-combat versions, the bullet would often leave the barrel before the powder was completely burnt. In this case the unburnt powder would continue to burn in the air, giving off a bright flash.

When barrel lengths dramatically decreased with the introduction of various assault rifles, this flash became a serious problem.   Originally limited to "special purpose" roles, it was now expected that all infantry weapons would have short barrels with this problem, and thereby be of limited use in night combat.  Flash suppressors became common on late-World War II and later assault rifle designs, and are almost universal on these weapons today.

It is commonly thought that they are used on military rifles to reduce visibility to the enemy, but the size of a device necessary to completely hide the muzzle flash from an enemy during the night would be prohibitive.  Military flash suppressors are designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the shooter to preserve their night vision, usually by directing the incandescent gases to the sides, away from the line of sight of the shooter.  Military forces engaging in night combat are still quite visible, and must move quickly after firing to avoid return fire.

Limiting the amount of powder to what the barrel can burn is one possible solution, but differences between individual cartridges mean that some will always have too much, and the reduced powder load produces a lower projectile velocity.  Muzzle flash can also be controlled by using cartridges with a faster-burning gunpowder, so that the propellant gases will already have begun to cool by the time they exit the barrel.  Faster-burning powder, however, produce less projectile velocity, which reduces both the accuracy and lethality of the weapon.

Flash suppressors reduce, or in some cases eliminate, the flash by rapidly expanding and cooling the gases as they leave the end of the barrel. Although the overall amount of burning gunpowder is unchanged, the density and temperature are greatly reduced, as is the brightness of the flash.

A number of different flash hider designs have been used. The simplest is a cone on the end of the barrel, which was used on the late-World War II jungle-combat versions of the Lee-Enfield, the No. 5 variant, intended for use in the Pacific. More modern solutions tend to use a "basket" with several slits or holes cut in it, as seen on the M16 and other small-bore weapons. Cone-shaped flash eliminators are also evident on the Bren LMG and on the turret-mounted aircraft machine guns of British WWII heavy bombers, which were used mostly at night.

Flash hiders are often used as a muzzle brake as well by symmetrically cutting slits near the top, but not the bottom, of the hider, which then provides some down-force on firing as the gases escape upwards, thereby reducing muzzle climb, as well as dust kick up.

 Legality .
United States.
Flash suppressors, and barrel shrouds were seen as 'military' features, and were on the list of Federally defined features that, provided enough features were also present on the semi-automatic rifle, then the rifle was defined as illegal, if manufactured after the effective date of the Federal assault weapons ban that went into effect in 1994 in the United States. Muzzle brakes, on the other hand, were ruled "legal" by the BATF. This meant, in practice, muzzle brakes had to be certified by the BATF to prevent end-users from accidentally violating the law and installing a device that could later be found to be defined legally as being more of a flash suppressor than a muzzle brake, even if marketed and sold as a muzzle brake, if incidental flash suppression was deemed to be 'significant' by the BATF.  The Federal laws governing this sunsetted in 2004, and are no longer of concern, except in those few jurisdictions in which specific state laws still retain certain provisions of the earlier and now defunct Federal law.

The Inuit language is traditionally spoken across the North American Arctic and to some extent in the subarctic in Labrador.  It was also to some degree spoken in far eastern Russia, particularly the Diomede Islands, but is almost certainly extinct in Russia today.  The Inuit live primarily in three countries: Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark), Canada, and the U.S. state of Alaska. 

The total population of Inuit speaking their traditional language is difficult to assess with precision, since most counts rely on self-reported census data that may not accurately reflect usage or competence.  Greenland census estimates place the number of speakers of Inuit dialects there at roughly 50,000, while Canadian estimates are at roughly 30,000. These two countries count the bulk of speakers of Inuit language variants, as usage in Alaska is increasingly moribund - roughly 3,000 Alaskans speak Inuit dialects out of a population of over 13,000 Inuit - and the language is almost certainly extinct in Russia.  In addition, an estimated 7,000 Greenlandic Inuit live in European Denmark, but this is the largest group outside of Canada and Greenland.  So, the global population of speakers of Inuit language variants is on the order of 90,000 people.

What is the Inuit language called?.
 
The traditional language of the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible from one end of the Inuit world to the other, and some people do not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages.  However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member tongues, since it forms a continuum of close dialects.  Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely their neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.  

As a result, Inuit in different places use different words for their own variants and for the entire group of languages, and this ambiguity has been carried into other languages, creating a great deal of confusion over what labels should be applied to it.

In Greenland the official form of Inuit language, and one of the official languages of the state, is called Kalaallisut.  In other languages, it is often called Greenlandic or some cognate term.  However, neither the words Kalaallisut nor Greenlandic are generally used to refer to the variants of Canada or Alaska.  In Alaska the language is called Inupiatun, but the variants of the Seward Peninsula are distinguished from the other Alaskan variants by calling them Qawiaraq, or for some dialects, Bering Straits Inupiatun.

In Canada, the word Inuktitut is routinely used to refer to all Canadian variants of the Inuit traditional language, and it is under that name that it is recognised as one of the official languages of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.  However, one of the variants of western Nunavut is called Inuinnaqtun to distinguish itself from the dialects of eastern Canada, while the variants of the Northwest Territories are sometimes called Inuvialuktun and have in the past sometimes been called Inuktun.  In those dialects, the name is sometimes rendered as Inuktitun to reflect dialectical differences in pronunciation.  The Inuit language of Quebec is called Inuttitut by its speakers, and often by other people, but this is a minor variation in pronunciation. In Labrador, the language is called Inuttut or, often in official documents, by the more descriptive name Labradorimiutut.  Furthermore, Canadians - both Inuit and non-Inuit - sometimes use the word Inuktitut to refer to all of the Inuit language variants, including those of Alaska and Greenland.

The phrase "Inuit language" is largely limited to professional discourse, since in each area, there is one or more conventional terms that cover all the local variants; or it is used as a descriptive term in publications where readers can't necessarily be expected to know the locally used words. But, this means that while you can call the French language French, you cannot call the Inuit language Inuit.  Saying "Peter speaks Inuit" is a very strange usage that most people who are familiar with the Inuit language would recognise as suspect, comparable to asserting that Hispanics must speak "Hispanic". The word Inuit is generally reserved for the ethnic group, both from its Inuit language meaning - it refers specifically to a group of people - and in the way the word has been adopted in English.

Although many people refer to the Inuit language as Eskimo language, this is an ambiguous term that can also include Yupik (see Eskimo-Aleut languages), and is in addition strongly discouraged in Canada and diminishing in usage elsewhere. See the article on Eskimo for more information on this word.

Classification and history.
The language of the Inuit is an Eskimo-Aleut language. It is fairly closely related to the Yupik languages, and more remotely to the Aleut languages. These cousin languages are all spoken in Western Alaska and Eastern Chukotka, Russia. It is not discernibly related to other North American or northwest Asian indigenous languages, although some have proposed that it is related to Indo-European languages as part of the hypothetical Nostratic superphylum, and there are those who consider it a Paleo-Siberian language, although that is more a geographic than a linguistic grouping. 

Early forms of the Inuit language were spoken by the Thule people, who overran the Dorset civilisation, which had previously occupied Arctic America, at the beginning of the second millennium. By 1300, the Inuit and their language had reached western Greenland, and finally east Greenland roughly at the same time the Viking colony in southern Greenland disappeared. It is generally believed that it was during this centuries-long eastwards migration that the Inuit language became distinct from the Yupik languages spoken in Western Alaska and Chukotka. 

Until 1902, an enclave of Dorset people or Sadlermiut (in modern Inuktitut spelling Sallirmiut) existed on Southampton Island. Almost nothing is known about their language, but the few eyewitness accounts tell of them speaking a "strange dialect". This suggests that they also spoke an Eskimo-Aleut language, but one quite distinct from the forms spoken in Canada today.

The Yupik and Inuit languages are very similar syntactically and morphologically. Their common origin can be seen in a number of cognates:




The western Alaskan variants retain a large number of features present in proto-Inuit language and in Yup'ik, enough so that they might be classed as Yup'ik languages if they were viewed in isolation from the larger Inuit world.

Geographic distribution and variants.
The Inuit language is a fairly closely linked set of dialects which can be broken up using a number of different criteria.  Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Iglulik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example.  However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit language because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary.  This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic.  This article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum.  This scheme is not the only one used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.

In addition to the territories listed below, some 7,000 Greenlandic speakers are reported to live in mainland Denmark , and according to the 2001 census roughly 200 self-reported Inuktitut native speakers regularly live in parts of Canada which are outside of traditional Inuit lands.

Alaska.
See Inupiatun and Qawiaraq for more information.

Of the roughly 13,000 Alaskan Inupiat, as few as 3,000 may still be able to speak Inuit language variants, with most of them over the age of 40.   Alaskan Inuit speak at least two fairly distinct dialects: 

Qawiaraq is spoken on the southern side of the Seward Peninsula and the Norton Sound area. It was also in the past spoken in Chukotka, particularly Big Diomede island, but appears to have vanished in Russian areas through assimilation into Yupik, Chukchi and Russian speaking communities.  It is radically different in phonology from other Inuit language variants.  Some people consider the Bering Strait dialect to be separate from Qawariaq. ;
Inupiatun is spoken on the North Slope and in the Kotzebue Sound area.  The variants of the Kotzebue Sound area and the northwest of Alaska are sometimes called Malimiutun or Malimiut Inupiatun.  However, despite significant differences in phonology, Malimiutun is readily comprehensible to other Alaskan Inupiat. ;

Canada.
See Inuktitut for more information.

The Inuit language is an official language in the Northwest Territories, the official and dominant language of Nunavut, enjoys a high level of official support in Nunavik, a semi-autonomus portion of Quebec, and is still spoken in some parts of Labrador.  Generally, Canadians refer to all dialects spoken in Canada as Inuktitut, but the terms Inuvialuktun, Inuinnaqtun, Nunatsiavummiutut, (sometimes called Inuttut or Labradorimiutut) have some currency in referring to the variants of specific areas.

Greenland.
See Kalaallisut for more information.

Greenland counts approximately 50,000 speakers of Inuit language variants, of whom over 90% speak west Greenlandic dialects at home.
Kalaallisut, or in English Greenlandic, is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of Greenland. This standard national language is now taught to all Greenlanders in school, regardless of their native dialect. It reflects almost exclusively the language of western Greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from Danish, while Canadian and Alaskan Inuit language variants have tended to take vocabulary from English or sometimes French and Russian.  It is written using the Roman alphabet.  The dialect of the Upernavik area in northwest Greenland is somewhat different in phonology from the standard dialect. ;
Tunumiit oraasiat, (or Tunumiusut in Kalaallisut, often East Greenlandic in other languages), is the dialect of eastern Greenland.  It differs sharply from other Inuit language variants and has roughly 3,000 speakers according to Ethnologue.
Inuktun (Or Avanersuartut in Kalaallisut) is the dialect of the area around Qaanaaq in  northern Greenland.  It is sometimes called the Thule dialect or North Greenlandic.  This area is the northernmost settlement area of the Inuit and has a relatively small number of speakers.  It is reputed to be fairly close to the North Baffin dialect, since a group of migratory Inuit from Baffin Island settled in the area during the 19th and early 20th centuries.  It counts under 1,000 speakers according to Ethnologue.

Phonology and Phonetics.
See main article Inuit language phonology and phonetics.

Eastern Canadian Inuit language variants have fifteen consonants and three vowels (which can be long or short). 

Consonants are arranged with five places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular; and three manners of articulation: voiceless stops, voiced continuants and nasals, as well as two additional sounds   voiceless fricatives.  The Alaskan dialects have an additional manner of articulation, the retroflex, which was present in proto-Inuit language.  Retroflexes have disappeared in all the Canadian and Greenlandic dialects.  In Natsilingmiutut, the voiced palatal plosive  derives from a former retroflex.

Almost all Inuit language variants have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels.  The only exceptions are at the extreme edges of the Inuit world - parts of Greenland, and in western Alaska.

Morphology and syntax.
See Inuit language morphology and syntax for a more detailed description specific to Nunavut Inuktitut.

The Inuit language, like other Eskimo-Aleut languages, has a very rich morphological system, in which a succession of different morphemes are added to root words (like verb endings in foreign European languages) to indicate things that, in languages like English, would require several words to express.  (See also: Agglutinative language and Polysynthetic language)  All Inuit language words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed.  The language has hundreds of distinct suffixes, in some dialects as many as 700.  Fortunately for learners, the language has a highly regular morphology.  Although the rules are sometimes very complicated, they do not have exceptions in the sense that English and other Indo-European languages do.

This system makes words very long, and potentially unique.  For example in central Nunavut Inuktitut:

tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga;
I can't hear very well.;

This long word is composed of a root word tusaa- - to hear - followed by five suffixes:

-tsiaq-well-junnaq-be able to-nngit-not-tualuu-very much-junga1st pers. singular present indicative non-specific;

This sort of word construction is pervasive in Inuit language and makes it very unlike English.  In one large Canadian corpus - the Nunavut Hansard - 92% of all words appear only once, in contrast to a small percentage in most English corpora of similar size.  This makes the application of Zipf's law quite difficult in the Inuit language.  Furthermore, the notion of a part of speech can be somewhat complicated in the Inuit language.  Fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns.  The word ilisaijuq can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb - "he studies" - but can also be interpreted as a noun: "student".  That said, the meaning is probably obvious to a fluent speaker, when put in context.

The morphology and syntax of the Inuit language vary to some degree between dialects, and the article Inuit language morphology and syntax describes primarily central Nunavut dialects, but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to Yupik as well.

Vocabulary.
Toponymy and Names.
Exotic as traditional Inuit names sound, both the names of places and people tend to be highly prosaic when translated.  Iqaluit, for example, is simply the plural of the noun iqaluk - "trout".  Iglulik simply means place with houses, a word that could be interpreted as simply town; Inuvik is place of people; Baffin Island - Qikiqtaaluk in Inuit language - approximately translates to "big island".

Although practically all Inuit have legal names based on southern naming traditions, at home and among themselves they still use native naming traditions.  There too, names tend to consist of highly prosaic words.  The Inuit traditionally believed that by adopting the name of a dead person or a class of things, they could take some of their characteristics or powers, and enjoy a part of their identity.  (This is why they were always very willing to accept European names - they believed that this made them equal to the Europeans.) 

Common native names in Canada include "Ujarak" (rock), "Nuvuk" (headland), "Nasak" (hat, or hood), "Tupiq" or "Tupeq" in Kalaallisut (tent), and "Qajaq" (kayak).  Inuit also use animal names, traditionally believing that by using those names, they took on some of the characteristics of that animal: "Nanuq" or "Nanoq" in Kalaallisut (polar-bear), "Uqalik" or "Ukaleq" in Kalaallisut (Arctic hare), and "Tiriaq" or "Teriaq" in Kalaallisut (ermine) are favourites.  In other cases, Inuit are named after dead people or people in traditional tales, by naming them after anatomical traits those people are believed to have had.  Examples include "Itigaituk" (has no feet), "Usuiituk" (has no penis), and "Tulimak" (rib).  Inuit may have any number of names, given by parents and other community members.

Words for snow.
See a more thorough discussion at Eskimo words for snow.

A popular belief exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow. This is not accurate, and results from a misunderstanding of the nature of polysynthetic languages. In fact, The Inuit have only a few base roots for snow: 'qanniq-' ('qanik-' in some dialects), which is used most often like the verb to snow, and 'aput', which means snow as a substance. Parts of speech work very differently in the Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.

The Inuit language can form very long words by adding more and more descriptive affixes to words.  Those affixes may modify the syntactic and semantic properties of the base word, or may add qualifiers to it in much the same way that English uses adjectives or prepositional phrases to qualify nouns (eg. "falling snow", "blowing snow", "snow on the ground", "snow drift", etc.)

The "fact" that there are many Inuit words for snow has been put forward so often it is somewhat of a journalistic cliché (as evidenced by a collection of quotes from linguist Mark Liberman).

Writing.
Because the Inuit language is spread over such a large area, divided between different nations and political units and originally reached by Europeans of different origins at different times, there is no uniform way of writing the Inuit language.  Most Inuktitut in Nunavut and Nunavik is written using a scheme called Inuktitut syllabics, based on Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics.  The western part of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories use a Roman alphabet scheme usually identified as Inuinnaqtun.  In Alaska, another Roman scheme is used.  Nunatsiavut uses another variant devised by German-speaking Moravian missionaries, which included the letter kra.  Greenland's Roman scheme was originally much like the one used in Nunatsiavut, but has been reformed and modified in recent years. 

The Canadian syllabary.
See Inuktitut syllabics for more information.

The Inuktitut syllabary used in Canada is based on the Cree syllabary devised by the missionary James Evans. The present form of the syllabary for Canadian Inuktitut was adopted by the Inuit Cultural Institute in Canada in the 1970s.  The Inuit in Alaska, the Inuvialuit, Inuinnaqtun speakers, and Inuit in Greenland and Labrador use the Roman alphabet, although it has been adapted for their use in different ways.

Though conventionally called a syllabary, the writing system has been classified by some observers as an abugida, since syllables starting with the same consonant have related glyphs rather than unrelated ones.

All of the characters needed for the Inuktitut syllabary are available in the Unicode character repertoire. (See Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics character table.)

Chris Van Dahl (also known as Roxy Dahl) is a rock musician notable for singing on the L.A. Guns album American Hardcore. Van Dahl grew up in Detroit, Michigan, but moved to Los Angeles, California to try to make it in the music business. In the early 1990s, prior to joining L.A. Guns, Van Dahl was the singer in another Los Angeles band   the glam metal band Cherry St. At this time, Van Dahl went by the stage name Roxy Dahl. He left Cherry St. in 1991 to form a new band, Boneyard. This group recorded a four-track demo, but never released a full album. So, in 1993, Van Dahl rejoined Cherry St., bringing Boneyard bassist "Redd" Rosell with him. That year, Cherry St. released the album Squeeze It Dry on JRS Records. In 1995, Van Dahl was recruited to be the singer for L.A. Guns. Changing to his real name, Chris Van Dahl, he sang on their 1996 album American Hardcore. Van Dahl also sang on the subsequent tour, but was let go from the band in 1997. After this, he formed The Vow with his former Boneyard compatriots Pauly Alvarez and Bobby Holder. In 2000, he joined a short-lived incarnation of Jizzy Pearl's band Love/Hate as a bassist, but it did not last the year. Next, Van Dahl formed a band with former Kid Rock guitarist Kenny Olson. The band, named Pack of Wolves, also featured Adam Kurry (former Legs Diamond bassist) who Van Dahl had played with in The Vow. In 2005, Van Dahl moved to Austin, Texas and hooked up with former Cherry St. guitarist Taz to form a new band, Black Beauties. Chris has a nephew Josh Tomalia who also is in a band called Steal Vengeance which he cofounded with friend Mike Doyle. His cooler nephew Jeffrey Hancock has a friend equally as cool named Madison.

<doc id="1057235" title="Early history of Switzerland" nonfiltered="955" processed="941" dbindex="1480962">


The early history of Switzerland begins with the earliest settlements up to the beginning of Habsburg rule, which in 1291 gave rise to the independence movement in the central cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden.

Prehistory.
Archeological evidence from the Wildkirchli cave in Appenzell suggests that hunter-gatherers settled in the lowlands north of the Alps by the late Paleolithic. In the Neolithic period, the area was relatively densely populated, as is attested to by the many archeological findings from that period. Remains of pile dwellings have been found in the shallow areas of many lakes.

In Neolithic Europe, the Swiss plateau was dominated by the Linear Pottery culture from the 5th millennium BC; it lay on the south-western outskirts of the Corded Ware horizon in the 3rd millennium BC, evolving into the early Bronze Age Beaker culture. The first Indo-European settlement likely dates to the 2nd millennium, at the latest in the form of the Urnfield culture from c. 1300 BC. The Swiss plateau lay in the western part of the pre- or proto-Celtic Halstatt culture, evolving into the Celtic La Tène culture from the 5th century BC. In the 1st century BC (late La Tène), the Swiss plateau was occupied by the Helvetii in the west and by the Vindelici in the east, while the Alpine parts of eastern Switzerland were inhabited by the Raetians.

Roman era.

In 58 BCE, the Helvetii tried to evade migratory pressure from Germanic tribes by moving into Gaul, but were stopped and defeated at Bibracte (near modern-day Autun) by Julius Caesar's armies and then sent back. In 15 BCE, Tiberius and Drusus conquered the Alps, and the region became integrated into the Roman Empire: the Helvetii settlement area became part first of Gallia Belgica and later of the province of Germania Superior, while the eastern part was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia.

The following 300 years saw extensive Roman settlement, including the construction of a road network and the founding of many settlements and cities. The center of Roman occupation was at Aventicum (Avenches), other cities were founded at Arbor Felix (Arbon), Augusta Raurica (Kaiseraugst near Basel), Basilea (Basel), Curia (Chur), Genava (Genève), Lousanna (Lausanne), Octodurum (|Martigny, controlling the pass of the Great St. Bernard), Salodurum (Solothurn), Turicum (Zürich) and other places. Military garrisons existed at Tenedo (Zurzach) and Vindonissa (Windisch).

The Romans also developed the Great St. Bernard Pass beginning in the year 47, and in 69 part of the legions of Vitellius used it to traverse the Alps. (It is doubtful whether Hannibal, in the Second Punic War some 300 years earlier, had crossed the alps over the Great St. Bernhard. Historians believe today that he had traveled over a lower and more southerly pass in the Alps between Lake Geneva and the Mediterranean Sea.)

In 259, Alamanni tribes overran the Limes and caused widespread devastation of Roman cities and settlements. The Roman empire managed to reestablish the Rhine as the border, and the cities on Swiss territory were rebuilt. However, it was now a frontier province, and consequently the new Roman cities were smaller and much more fortified.

Christianization and post-Roman era.

In the late Roman period in the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Christianization of the region began. Legends of Christian martyrs such as Felix and Regula in Zürich probably are based on events that occurred during the persecution of Christians under Diocletian around 298.

The first bishoprics were founded in the 4th and 5th century in Basel (documented in 346), Martigny (doc. 381, moved to Sion in 585), Geneva (doc. 441), and Chur (doc. 451). There is evidence from the 6th century for a bishopric in Lausanne, which maybe had been moved from Avenches.

With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Germanic tribes moved in. Burgundians settled in the Jura, the Rhône valley and the Alps south of Lake Geneva; while in the north, Alamannic settlers crossed the Rhine in 406 and slowly assimilated the Gallo-Roman population, or made it retreat into the mountains. Burgundy became a part of the Frankish kingdom in 534; two years later, the dukedom of Alemannia followed suit.

The Burgundy kings furthered the Christianization through newly founded monasteries, e.g. at Romanmôtier or St. Maurice in the Valais in 515. In the Alaman part, only isolated Christian communities continued to exist; the Germanic faith including the worship of Wuodan was prevalent. The Irish monks Columbanus and Gallus re-introduced Christian faith in the early 7th century. The Bishopric of Konstanz also was founded at that time.

 Middle Ages .


 ]]
Under the Carolingian kings, the feudal system proliferated, and monasteries and bishopries were important bases for maintaining the rule. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 assigned the western part of modern Switzerland (Upper Burgundy) to Lotharingia, ruled by Lothair I, and the eastern part (Alemannia) to the eastern kingdom of Louis the German that would become the Holy Roman Empire. The boundary between Alamania, ruled by Louis, and western Burgundy, ruled by Lothar, ran along the lower Aare, turning towards the south at the Rhine, passing west of Lucerne and across the Alps along the upper Rhône to Saint Gotthard Pass.

Louis the German in 853 assigned a monastery in Zürich as the Fraumünster to his daughter Hildegard. According to legend this occurred after a stag bearing an illuminated crucifix between his antlers appeared to him in the marshland outside the town, at the shore of Lake Zürich. However, there is evidence that the monastery was already in existence before 853. The Fraumünster is across the river from the Grossmünster, which according to legend was founded by Charlemagne himself, as his horse fell to his knees on the spot where the martyrs Felix and Regula were buried.

In the 10th century, the rule of the Carolingians waned: Magyars destroyed Basel in 917 and St. Gallen in 926, and Saracenes ravaged the Valais after 920 and sacked the monastery of St. Maurice in 939. Only after the victory of king Otto I over the Magyars in 955 in the Battle of Lechfeld, the Swiss territories were reintegrated into the empire.

King Rudolph III of Upper Burgundy (r. 993 1032) gave the Valais as his fiefdom to the Bishop of Sion in 999, and when Burgundy and thus also the Valais became part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1032, the bishop was also appointed count of the Valais, but was dominated by the 12th century by the Duchy of Savoy.

Also in the 12th century, the dukes of Zähringen were given authority over part of the Burgundy territories, covering the western part of modern Switzerland. They founded many cities, the most important being Freiburg in 1120, Fribourg in 1157, and Berne in 1191. The Zähringer dynasty ended with the death of Berchtold V in 1218, and their cities subsequently thus became independent, while the dukes of Kyburg competed with the house of Habsburg over control of the rural regions of the former Zähringer territory. 

Under the Hohenstaufen rule, the alpine passes in Raetia and the St. Gotthard Pass gained importance. Especially the latter became an important direct route through the mountains. The construction of the "Devil s Bridge" () across the  in 1198 led to a marked increase in traffic on the mule treck over the pass. Frederick II accorded the Reichsfreiheit to Schwyz in 1240 in the Freibrief von Faenza in an attempt to place the important pass under his direct control, and his son and for some time co-regent Henry VII had already given the same privileges to the valley of Uri in 1231 (the ). Unterwalden was  realm-free, since most of its territory belonged to monasteries, which had become independent even earlier in 1173 under Frederick I "Barbarossa" and in 1213 under Frederick II.

The city of Zürich also became a realm-free liberty in 1218.

The rise of the Habsburg dynasty gained momentum when their main local competitor, the Kyburg dynasty, died out and they could thus bring much of the territory south of the Rhine under their control. Subsequently, they managed within only a few generations to extend their influence through Swabia in south-eastern Germany to Austria. Rudolph I of Habsburg, who became emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 1273, instituted a strict rule in his homelands and raised the taxes tremenduously to finance wars and further territorial acquisitions. As king, he finally had also become the direct liege lord of the "Forest Communities" (Waldstätten, i.e. Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden), which thus saw their previous independence curtailed.

In the Valais, increasing tensions between the bishops of Sion and the Counts of Savoy led to a war beginning in 1260. The war ended after the  Battle at the Scheuchzermatte near Leuk in 1296, where the Savoy forces were crushed by the bishop's army, supported by forces from Berne. After the peace of 1301, Savoy kept only the lower part of the Valais, while the bishop controlled the upper Valais.

Zhang Zhong Jing, author of "On Cold Disease", the Shang Han Lun was the Hippocrates of Chinese medicine.   He lived from 115-218 AD.  The Shang Han Lun or Shang Han Bin Lun provides the earliest framework for diagnosis and treatment of diseases from exterior wind-cold. This corresponds roughly to viral infections affecting the respiratory tract.  Although his famous classic does also discuss infections caused by invasions of wind-heat and their treatment, a comprehensive theory of exterior diseases from Wind-Heat was not developed until the late 1600s.  

The canonical Shang Han Lun lays out a sophisticated diagnostic technique for exterior wind cold diseases.  The book has 397 sections with 112 herbal prescriptions. The discussion is based on the Six Divisions: 1 The Six Divisions of the Shang Han Lun are: 


TAl YANG (greater yang): a milder stage with external symptoms of chills, fevers, stiffness, and
headache. Therapy: sweating

YANG MING (yang brightness): a more severe internal excess yang condition with fever without chills,
distended abdomen, and constipation. Therapy: cooling and eliminating

SHAO YANG (lesser yang): half outside, half inside half excess and half deficiency with chest
discomfort, alternating chills, and fever. Therapy: harmonizing

TAl YIN (greater yin): chills, distended abdomen with occasional pain. Therapy: warming with
supplementing.

<doc id="157333" title="USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)" nonfiltered="959" processed="945" dbindex="1480966">

The USS Shenandoah was the first of four United States Navy rigid airships. She was built from 1922 to 1923 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and first flew in 1923. She developed the Navy's experience with rigid airships, even making the first crossing of the North American continent by airship. She was destroyed in a crash in 1925.

 Design and construction .
The Shenandoah was originally designated FA-1, for 'Fleet Airship Number One' but this was changed to ZR-1. The airship was 680 feet long and weighed 36 tons. She had a range of 5,000 miles, and could reach speeds of 70 miles per hour. The Shenandoah was assembled in Lakehurst, New Jersey between 1922 and 1923, in the only hangar large enough for the ship to fit, Hangar Number One, built in 1921. (Her parts were fabricated beforehand at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia.) Lakehurst Naval Air Station had already served as a base for Navy blimps for some time, but the Shenandoah was the first rigid airship to join the Navy's fleet.   


The design was initially based on the L-49 (LZ-96) Zeppelin bomber, which was downed during World War I in the American sector of France. The L-49 was a lightened "height climber", designed for altitude at the expense of other qualities. The design was found insufficient and a number of the features of newer Zeppelins were incorporated into the design, as well as some structural improvements. The structure was built from a new alloy of aluminum and copper known as duralumin. Whether the changes introduced into the original design of L-49 played a part in its later breaking up is a matter of debate.

The Shenandoah had a significant edge in safety over airships that came before it in that it was the first rigid airship to use helium rather than hydrogen. A similar precaution would have prevented the Hindenburg disaster twelve years later. Helium supplies were relatively rare at the time, though, and the Shenandoah used much of the world's reserves just to fill its enormous volume.  The USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), the next rigid airship to enter Navy service, was at first filled with the helium from the Shenandoah until more could be procured.

The first frame of the Shenandoah was erected by 24 June 1922; and, on 20 August 1923, the completed airship was floated free of the ground. She was christened on 10 October 1923; sponsored by Mrs. Edwin Denby, wife of the Secretary of the Navy; and commissioned on the same day, Commander Frank R. McCrary in command.

 Early Naval service .
The USS Shenandoah took to the sky for the first time on September 4, 1923. 



Shenandoah was designed for fleet reconnaissance work of the type carried out by German naval airships in World War I. Her precommissioning trials included long range flights during September and early October 1923, to test her airworthiness in rain, fog, and poor visibility. On 27 October, Shenandoah celebrated Navy Day with a flight down the Shenandoah Valley and returned to Lakehurst that night by way of Washington and Baltimore, where crowds gathered to see the new airship in the beams of searchlights.



At this time, Rear Admiral William Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and staunch advocate of the airship, was discussing the possibility of using Shenandoah to explore the Arctic. Such a program, he felt, would produce valuable weather data as well as experience in cold-weather operations. With her endurance and ability to fly at low speeds, the airship was thought to be well suited to such work. President Calvin Coolidge approved Moffett's proposal, but on 16 January 1924, Shenandoah was torn from her Lakehurst mooring mast by a gale, and her nose was damaged. She rode out the storm and landed safely, but a period of repair was needed, and the Arctic expedition was dropped.

Shenadoah s repairs were completed in May, and she devoted the summer of 1924 to work with her powerplant and radio equipment to prepare for her duty with the fleet. On 1 August, she reported for duty with the Scouting Fleet and took part in tactical exercises. Shenandoah succeeded in discovering the  enemy  force as planned but lost contact with it in foul weather. Technical difficulties and lack of support facilities in the fleet forced her to depart the operating area ahead of time to return to Lakehurst. Although this marred the exercises as far as airship reconnaissance went, it emphasized the need for advanced bases and maintenance ships if lighter-than-air craft were to take any part in operations of this kind.

 Flight across North America .

In July of 1924 the oiler Patoka (AO-9) put in to Norfolk Navy Yard for extensive modifications to become the Navy's first Airship Tender. An experimental mooring mast some 125 feet above the water was constructed; additional accommodations both for the crew of Shenandoah and for the men who would handle and supply the airship were added; facilities for the helium, gasoline, and other supplies necessary for Shenandoah were built; as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes. Shenandoah engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with Patoka to determine the practicality of mobile fleet support of scouting airships. The first successful mooring was made 8 August 1924. During October of 1924, Shenandoah flew from Lakehurst to California and on to Washington to test newly erected mooring masts. This was the first flight of a rigid airship across North America. 

 Later Naval career .
The year 1925 began with nearly six months of maintenance and ground test work. Shenandoah did not take to the air until 26 June, when she began preparations for summer operations with the fleet. During July and August, she again operated with the Scouting Fleet, successfully performing scouting problems and being towed by Patoka while moored to that ship's mast.

 Wreck of the Shenandoah .


On 2 September 1925, Shenandoah departed Lakehurst on a promotional flight to the Midwest which would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs. Testing of a new mooring mast at Dearborn, Michigan was included in the schedule. While passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over Ohio early in the morning of the 3rd, the airship was torn apart and crashed in several pieces near Caldwell. Shenandoah s commanding officer, Commander Zachary Lansdowne, and 13 other officers and men were killed. Twenty-nine survivors succeeded in riding three sections of the airship to earth.

The fatal flight had been made under protest by Cmdr. Lansdowne (a native of Ohio), who warned of the violent weather conditions which were prevalent in the area and common to Ohio in late summer. His pleas for a cancellation of the flight only led to a postponement. His superiors were keen to publicize airship technology, and justify the huge cost of the airship to the taxpayers, so publicity, rather than prudence won the day. This event was the trigger for Army Colonel Billy Mitchell to heavily criticize the leadership of both the Army and the Navy, leading directly to his court-martial for insubordination and the end of his military career.

Shenandoah Elementary School and Shenandoah High School in Noble County, Ohio (where the crash occurred) is named in honor of the ship and crew. Its sports teams are nicknamed "The Zeps".

Ballavpur is a census town under Raniganj police station  of Asansol subdivision in Barddhaman district  in the state of West Bengal, India. The place is adjacent to Raniganj town. It on the northern bank of Damodar River and Mejia is across the river in Bankura District

Geography.
The Asansol-Durgapur region is composed of undulating latterite region. This area lies between two mighty rivers   the Damodar and the Ajay. They flow almost parallel to each other in the region   the average distance between the two rivers is around 30 km. For ages the area was heavily forested and infested with plunderers and marauders. The discovery of coal led to industrialisation of the area and most of the forests have been cleared.  

Demographics.
As of 2001 India census, Ballavpur had a population of 5391. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Ballavpur has an average literacy rate of 65%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 61% of the males and 39% of females literate. 10% of the population is under 6 years of age.

Economy.

Bengal Paper Mills was set up at Ballavpur in 1887. At the time of independence it was producing 11,760 tonnes of paper.    The mill was closed in 1999. The EMTA Group of Kolkata has taken over the assets and properties of the Bengal Paper Mills Co Ltd. The deal cost the group Rs 25 crore. The Rs 350-crore turnover EMTA Group is engaged in the coal mining business. It has been proposed that a new company would be formed and an industrial complex would be set up at the plant complex. Outdated machinery and technology will be discarded and new machinery for manufacturing specialty paper set up. It has also been proposed to set up an integrated steel plant, and a 300 MW capacity thermal power plant within the existing complex. The total investment in these projects would be Rs 1,600 crore and would be commissioned in phases by April 2009.  

Education.
Ballavpur has four primary and one higher secondary school.

Maurice Rioli (born 1957 at Melville Island, Northern Territory) is a former Australian rules football player for the Richmond Tigers in the Australian Football League and politician.

Rioli is regarded as one of the greatest players in the decades of the 1970s and 1980s and Aboriginal footballers of all time, being named as the center of the Indigenous Team of the Century.

The highly skilled and solidly built centreman was a known performer on the big stage.  He won consecutive Simpson Medals for best on ground for South Fremantle in 1980 and 1981.  In 1982, he debuted for the Richmond Football Club in the Victorian Football League.  He won the Norm Smith Medal as best on ground against the Carlton Football Club in the same year.   Rioli narrowly missed winning a Brownlow Medal when he came second to Ross Glendinning in 1983.  He won back to back Best and Fairest awards for Richmond in 1982 and 1983.

Hailing from a famous football family and originally from the Tiwi Islands Melville Island with a boxing background, Rioli began his football career at the St Marys Football Club before moving to Perth, Western Australia to further his footballing career with the South Fremantle Football Club in the WAFL, finishing 4th in the Sandover Medal in 1979.

He played a total of 118 VFL/AFL games, kicking 80 goals before returning to WA in 1988 to captain South Fremantle.  He played in a total of 5 WAFL grand finals for South Fremantle in 1975, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1989, as well as a VFL grand final for Richmond in 1982, but was only victorious once, in 1980.

During his career, Maurice Rioli represented Western Australia in State of Origin 13 times and also the Northern Territory on 8 ocasions, including 5 as captain.  He earnt selection in the VFL/AFL's Team of the Year in 1983, 1986 and 1988 and All-Australian selection in 1983 and 1986.  Rioli toured Ireland with the Australian International Rules Team in 1984.

Post Football Career.
As the NTFL's season operates in summer during the off-season of the southern leagues, Rioli was able to combine playing for South Fremantle in the WAFL and coaching the Waratah Football Club in the NTFL.

In 1992 Rioli was elected as the member for Arafura in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for the Australian Labor Party.  He held this position until 2001 when he retired from parliament.

Rioli is now a Community Services manager for the Tiwi Islands Council.  He recently turned down the offer of coaching the Super Tiwis side to enter the Northern Territory Football League.

Marine Aircraft Group 15 (MAG-15) was s United States Marine Corps aviation group established during World War II.  MAG-15, a transport and photo-reconnaissance training group,  was commissioned on March 1, 1942, headquartered at Camp Kearny, San Diego. In addition to radio and photographic training, the Group also conducted a navigation school.  Additional roles included West Coast aircraft acceptance and transport service for the Marine Corps.  

 History .
World War II.
Marine Aircraft Group 15 was commissioned on March 1, 1942 at Camp Kearney, San Diego, California.    For the next two years the group remained there as the transportation, observation and photo reconnaissance training group.  They trained pilots and crews to serve in the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT).   From its commission in 1942 until 1944, MAG-15 trained and dispatched the following unit for overseas deployment: VMD-154 and VMD-254; VMO-151 and VMO-155; and VMJ-152, VMJ-153, VMJ-353, VMJ-952, and VMJ-953.

MAG-15 shipped out from Camp Kearney to the South Pacific on March 2, 1944.  They arrived in Apamama on April 1 and operated from there as part of the Transport Air Group until Ocotober of 1944.  In October they were ordered to establish the Air Transport Group (ATG) in order to in order to provide transportation services to units in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands.  ATG was redesignated the Troop Carrier Group (TCG) in November of 1944.  MAG-15 then became part of Task Unit 96.1 which was disbanded shortly thereafter on March 25, 1945 as its responsibilities were assumed by the NATS. 

Headquarters Squadron 15 was sent to Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii in April 1945 and was quickly joined by VMR-953 and VMR-352.  They stayed there through the end of the war becoming part of the TAG again and controlling the transportation units for the Marines throughout the Pacific.  

In January 1947 the group became dual roled when they also had fighter squadrons attach and in May of 1947 they became all fighter squadrons.  In March of 1949 they returned to the United States and were based at Marine Corps Air Station Edenton, North Carolina.            

 Vietnam War .

MAG-15 moved to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in  July 1966 and included VMA(AW)-533, VMFA-334 and VMFA-232.

 Stand down .
In December 1989, MAG-15 stood down after 46 years of service. 

 Notable commanders .
 Peter Pace, current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff served as executive officer, 1972-1973.

<doc id="328051" title="New York Dragons" nonfiltered="968" processed="954" dbindex="1480975">


The New York Dragons are an Arena Football League team.

History.
The team is based in suburban Uniondale, New York at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, also home to the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League.

Iowa Barnstormers (1995-2000).
They had been based in Des Moines, Iowa from 1995 to 2000, as the Iowa Barnstormers. The team had been successful in Iowa, having reached the ArenaBowl in 1996 and 1997, but the need for a more modern venue as well as the league's desire for a larger market led to the move despite two failed past attempts in New York, the New York Knights (1988) and the New York CityHawks (1997-1998), both of which played at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The team was purchased by Charles Wang, who is also the Islanders' majority owner.



The Arena Football organization did award an af2 franchise to Iowa for the 2001 season also called the Barnstormers, but that team folded after that season.  The Barnstormers were noted for their unique uniforms, which in keeping with the aviation theme included the depiction of goggles on the helmets, wings on the shoulders of the jerseys, and propellers on the pants legs.  The primary figures in the original Iowa organization was Jim Foster, the inventor of Arena Football and Kurt Warner, the quarterback who won the both the NFL MVP award and the MVP for Super Bowl XXXIV. 

Aside from the league's desire to re-enter the New York market, another major reason cited for the team's relocation was the inadequacy of their Des Moines venue, the Iowa Veterans Memorial Auditorium, also known as "The Barn".  All seating in this venue was located directly along the sidelines as is typical of high school sports venues.  The Barnstormers organization constantly lobbied for the construction of a better facility during their time in Des Moines, to no avail. 

In 2005, the Wells Fargo Arena opened in Des Moines, directly across from what the locals call "Vets", as part of the Iowa Events Center. It was built too late to keep the Barnstormers, but could lure an Arena Football team to Des Moines in the future.

New York Dragons (2001-present).
Nassau Coliseum, where the franchise relocated, is generally regarded as one of the most marginal venues currently used in major American professional sports, and is often proposed for replacement, so the improvement of the situation with regards to a venue has been fairly minimal to this point. In late September of 2004, Islanders' ownership announced an ambitious project to renovate the Coliseum, surrounding it with housing units and construction of an adjacent tower, resembling a lighthouse, at a total cost of over $200 million (US).  Since, the lighthouse has been taken out of the design plan.

The New York Dragons currently compete in the Eastern Division of the National Conference.  They are coached by former Barnstormer defensive back Weylan Harding. In the 2006 season Weylan Harding became the most winningest Arena Football league coach in his first two seasons as a coach, winning twenty games throughout the 2005 and 2006 seasons.

The Dragons have one of the biggest stars in Arena Football today, Aaron Garcia. Garcia, a quarterback, has the honor of most touchdown passes in a game (11), and most touchdown passes in a season (104, set in 2001). Through his 10 year career, he has thrown over 750 touchdown passes. 

The Dragons set the league record for most points in a game, scoring 99 against the Carolina Cobras on July 7, 2001, surpassing the previous record of 91, which had been set by the New Jersey Red Dogs in 1997 against the Texas Terror.  It also set a record for the most points scored in one game (167).

On Saturday, February 11, 2006, the Dragons won against the expansion team Utah Blaze 84-81 on the road and they made AFL history for the second-most points scored in one game with 165.

The Dragons official mascot is a dragon named Sparky, who is also the mascot of the NHL's New York Islanders.

^Despite winning their division in 2004, the Dragons failed to make the playoffs.

Gemini 6A (officially Gemini VI-A) was a 1965 manned spaceflight in NASA's Gemini program. It was the 5th manned Gemini flight, the 13th manned American flight and the 21st spaceflight of all time (includes X-15 flights over 100 km).  It was the last U.S. spacecraft to be flown using batteries as the primary power source (except for the Apollo Lunar Module, which used batteries, but was augmented by the fuel cells on the Apollo Command Module while docked).  All remaining Gemini flights used fuel cells.

Objectives.
Gemini 6 was originally intended to be the first mission to dock with an Agena Target Vehicle.  However, after a failure in the Agena target 6 minutes after its launch (when the crew of Gemini 6 was already sitting in their capsule waiting for their launch), the mission was canceled.  Reviewing the situation, NASA decided to substitute an alternate mission: a meeting in space of two Gemini spacecraft.  The new mission would be known as Gemini 6A, and would launch eight days after the launch of Borman and Lovell's Gemini VII.   Schirra and Stafford tried to join them, but their Titan 2 launcher shut down on the pad (the cool-headed Schirra did not eject, even though the countdown clock had started ticking-he felt no motion, and trusted his senses). Three days later, Gemini 6A made it into orbit. Using guidance from the computer as well as his own piloting, Schirra performed the space rendezvous with the companion spacecraft in orbit on the afternoon of December 15. Once in formation, the two Gemini capsules flew around each other, coming within 0.3 meters of each other but never touching. The two spacecraft stayed in close proximity for five hours. One of Gemini's primary goals-orbital rendezvous-had been achieved.

The first launch attempt of Gemini 6A was on December 12. All went well right up to ignition--in fact the engines did ignite, but then a plug fell out of the bottom of the rocket, starting the onboard programmer.  This was not meant to happen until the rocket had actually lifted off, and the onboard computer detected that there was no upwards motion, causing it to abort the launch.  At this point mission rules dictated that the crew should eject from the spacecraft, as the rocket would explode on impact with the pad if it had lifted off by even an inch.

Schirra elected not to eject as neither he nor Stafford had detected any upwards motion, and the ejection seats were seen as a last resort.  In an early test of the system involving a dummy the hatch had failed to blow off and the dummy's head was rammed into the side of the spacecraft.   Also all ejection seats cause compression of the spine and these were designed to send the astronauts a couple of hundred metres away from an exploding rocket.

The Martin and Air Force teams who erected and tested the rocket found that some plugs on the rocket were able to pull out more easily than others.  They replaced them with the ones that were harder to pull out and on future missions, and a safety wire was added to make sure that the rocket had lifted off.

However, another problem was found as the engineers examined the thrust versus time graph.  They found that the thrust rose nominally but started to get lower before the plug had fallen out.   Through the night, engineers examined the rocket engine piece by piece until they found that a plastic cover had been left in the gas generator port. With this problem solved the rocket and spacecraft were recycled for a launch 72 hours after the first attempt.

Rendezvous.
The third attempt to launch Gemini Spacecraft Number 6 was finally successful on December 15. All went well through launch and ascent and the crew entered a 161 by 259 kilometers orbit. 

The plan called for the rendezvous to take place on the fourth orbit of Gemini 6A. Their first burn came 94 minutes after launch when they increased their speed by 5 meters per second. Due to their lower orbit they were gaining on Gemini 7 and were only 1,175 kilometers behind. The next burn was at 2 hours and 18 minutes when Gemini 6A made a phase adjustment to put them on the same orbital inclination as Gemini 7. They now only trailed by 483 kilometers.

The radar on Gemini 6A first made contact with Gemini 7 at 3 hours and 15 minutes when they were 434 kilometers away. A third burn put them into a 270 by 274 kilometer orbit. As they slowly gained, Schirra put Gemini 6A's computer in charge of the rendezvous. At 5 hours and 4 minutes he saw a bright star that he thought was Sirius, but this was in fact Gemini 7.

After several more burns the two spacecraft were only 40 meters apart. The burns had only used 51 kilograms of fuel on Gemini 6A, giving plenty of fuel for some fly arounds. During the next 270 minutes the crews moved as close as 30 centimetres to 90 meters, talking over the radio. At one stage the spacecraft were stationkeeping so well that neither crew had to make any burns for 20 minutes.

As the sleep periods approached Gemini 6A made a separation burn and slowly drifted out to 16 kilometers. This ensured that there wouldn't be any accidental collisions in the night. But before everyone went to sleep, the crew of Gemini 6A had a surprise for everyone. 

Gemini VII, this is Gemini VI. We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in polar orbit .  Looks like he might be going to reenter soon. Stand by one . You just might let me to pick up that thing . I see a command module and eight smaller modules in front. The pilot of the command module is wearing a red suit.

At that point, the sound of "Jingle Bells" was heard played on an 8-hole harmonica and a handful of small bells. The Smithsonian claims these were the first musical instruments played in space  and keeps the instruments on display.

Reentry.
Gemini 6A reentered the next day landing within 18 km of the planned site, the first truly accurate reentry. It was also the first to be televised live, through a satellite linkup from the recovery aircraft carrier USS Wasp.

The Gemini 7 & 6A missions were supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources; 10,125 personnel, 125 aircraft and 16 ships.

Insignia.
Walter Schirra explained the patch in his book All We Did Was Fly to the Moon:
The Gemini 6 patch is hexagonal in shape, reflecting the mission number; and the spacecraft trajectory also traces out the number "6". The Gemini 6 spacecraft is shown superimposed on the "twin stars" Castor and Pollux, for "Gemini".

I designed the patch to locate in the sixth hour of celestial right ascension. This was the predicted celestial area where the rendezvous should occur (in the constellation Orion). It finally did occur there.

The original patch had called the flight G-T-A-6 (for Gemini-Titan-Agena) and showed the Gemini craft chasing an Agena. It was changed when the mission was altered.

Capsule location.
The capsule is currently on display at the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City, after having been on display at the Omniplex Science Museum elsewhere in the city. It is on a long term loan from the Smithsonian Institution. Before coming to Oklahoma, the capsule was displayed at the St. Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.

<doc id="2542378" title="Cinema of Malaysia" nonfiltered="972" processed="958" dbindex="1480979">


The cinema of Malaysia revolves around a small film industry that dates back to the 1930s. At present, Malaysia produces about 15 feature films annually, and between 300   400 television dramas and serials a year apart from the in-house productions by the individual television stations. Malaysia also holds its own annual National Film Festival . There are about 250 movie theatres and cineplexes in Malaysia, showing not only local films but imported ones. Foreign film producers are welcome to shoot on location in Malaysia, undertake film co-production ventures so that local artistes and technicians have the opportunity of gaining exposure and experience. 

Early films, 1933-48.
Malaysian cinema began in 1933 with Laila Majnun, based on a classical Persian story of two ill-fated lovers. Directed by B.S. Rajhans and produced by the Singapore-based Motilal Chemical Company of Bombay, the cast was derived from a local opera group. Observing the success of this project, two brothers, Run Run and Run Me Shaw, were prompted in 1937 to import some equipment from Shanghai and start the production of Malay films from their small studio at Ampas Road in Singapore. However, they only managed to produce five or six movies prior to the Japanese invasion in 1941. 

Following the end of World War II in 1945, the Shaw Brothers resumed production in 1947 with a Rajhans-directed film called Singapura Di Waktu Malam (Singapore by Night) starring Siput Sarawak. Backed by their chain of theatres, which they either owned or rented, the film enjoyed a good response. The Shaw Brothers proceeded to produce more films and introduced new faces, including the Sumatran-born Kasma Booty. Her first film, Cempaka, revolved around the life of a native island girl. 

In 1948, P. Ramlee - who later became the living legend of the Malay film world, made his debut in the film Cinta (Love). P. Ramlee s talents in music composing and singing brought him prominence. He was very versatile as a leading actor, a comic, dramatic artiste, scripwriter and film director. Most of the early films carried plenty of singing and dancing scenes, a trend introduced by the Indian film directors. After Rajhans, Shaw Brothers imported many other Indian film directors, among them S. Ramanathan, Shastri, Phani Majumdar and D. Ghoss. There were also some local film directors such as L. Krishnan and K. M. Bashker who learned the trade and techniques through experience and apprenticeship. By the 1960s, many of the expatriates were replaced by local directors.

Development and decline, 1948-75.
The success enjoyed by the Shaw Brother s film studio, known as the Malay Film Productions (MPP), encouraged a few other entrepreneurs to venture into the same business. There was a Nusantara film company started. In 1951, Hsu Chiu Meng started the Nusantara film company. However, he depended heavily on independent theatres, and after producing about a dozen films Nusantara closed down in 1954. 

In 1952, Ho Ah Loke opened a studio in Tempines Road, Singapore, calling his company Rimau Film Productions. After producing one film, he changed its name to Keris Film Productions. Ho owned a few small theatres through his earlier venture as a film distributor. He managed to produce a number of films, and in 1956 merged with Cathay Organisation, owned by millionaire Loke Wan Tho. The company was renamed Cathy-Keris Film Productions with its studio in East Coast Road, Singapore. Supported by their own theatre chain throughout Malaya and Singapore, Cathay-Keris films posed a challenge to the films produced by Shaw s MFP studios. Shaw studios produced about ten films a year, while Cathay-Keris too produced about the same number. 

During those early years, all the films were in black and white. The studios had their own laboratories, recording and editing facilities. Direct sound recording was the practice from the beginning, until the advent of the 60s. Then, post-synching or dubbing system appeared and is still in use until today. 

The screenplays were mostly based on folk tales, stage plays, legends of fictional or real historical heroes or events. MFP made the movie about the legendary Melaka warrior Hang Tuah who lived during the heyday of the Melaka Sultanate. In response, Cathay-Keris produced Hang Jebat who was Hang Tuah s closest friend but due to unfortunate circumstances became involved in a life-or-death struggle with him. 

Hang Tuah, done in Eastman Color, was directed by Indian director Phani Majumdar, who was specially brought in to ensure that the film made it to the East Asia Film Festival. P. Ramlee acted as Hang Tuah and also composed the background music, for which the film won an award. 

Just before they ceased operations, both MFP and Cathay-Keris produced three colour films each. Shaw Brothers  produced Ribut (Storm), Hang Tuah and Raja Bersiong (The Fanged King). The latter, a legend from the state of Kedah, was written by Malaysia s first Prime Minister, the late Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra al-Haj. 

Cathay-Keris produced Buluh Perindu (The Magic Flute), Cinta Gadis Rimba (The Virgin Of Borneo) and Mahsuri (The Maid of Langkawi), another Kedah legend written by Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra. 

Although many companies emerged, such as Nusantara Films, Tan & Wong Film Company, Rimau Productions and Cathay-Keris, many closed down due to escalating production costs and diminishing audiences, leaving only MFP and Cathay-Keris both operating in Singapore. 

In 1961, H. M. Shah bought over a piece of prime land on the fringe of Kuala Lumpur and turned it into Merdeka Studio. It had a meagre beginning, but once the top stars started their exodus from the two Singapore studios, its growth surged dramatically. Located adjacent to the National Zoo on Hulu Kelang Road, is 13 kilometres from the city. Today, it is the headquarters of the National Film Development Corporation, Malaysia (FINAS). The Shaw Brothers dispatched some of their Singapore film directors, among them L. Krishnan, P. Ramlee and Salleh Ghani, Jamil Sulong, Omer Rojik, S. Kadarisman, Sudarmaji, Naz Achnas, M. Amin and Datuk Jins Shamsudin, to make films at Merdeka. 

Renaissance, 1975-present.
In 1975, a renaissance prompted a revitalised growth when Sabah Films grossed huge profits with its maiden offering, Keluarga Comat (Comat s Family). Soon, other companies mushroomed, such as Perfima, Syed Kechik Productions, Indra film Productions, Jins Shamsudin Production and others. 

The '80s saw numerous changes. A vital one was the setting up of the National Film Development Corporation of Malaysia in 1981 to develop and stimulate the growth and maintain the standards of the film industry by various means, including the provision of research and advisory services. FINAS has since set up numerous facilities to promote the industry, including a credit facility scheme which enables young and untiring film-makers to test their potential. The revival in the industry also made changes to certain formats of the local film productions. Nearly all the films were made in colour, some using the scope format and some the standard format. There were no fixed salaries for artists attached to a certain company or studio. A company can only do two of three functions: production, distribution or exhibition in order to avoid a monopoly by a certain party. The producers also might be able to recover part of their investment by the return of the entertainment tax as a way of incentive. A further incentive to local film-makers is that they are invited to make television programmes either in film format or video format. As a result, there are now more than 300 film companies registered with FINAS.

Heart and Soul is a popular song.  The music was written by Hoagy Carmichael, the lyrics by Frank Loesser. The song was published in 1938.  The original 1938 version was performed by Larry Clinton & His Orchestra featuring Bea Wain. Listen to the original: here.

The tune is very commonly played by two people side by side on a piano (). Virtually all beginner piano students (and even some people who cannot play the piano) know at least one of the two parts.

The film Big famously features the song being played on a giant foot-operated electronic keyboard.

The film Stuart Little features the song, played and sung by Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis.

The film Superman Returns also features the song being played on a grand piano inside of Lex Luthor's yacht. 

In episode 20 of the TV series, LOST, Heart and Soul is played by Jack Shepherd and his new wife in a flashback.

In 1939, three versions charted: Larry Clinton (reaching #1 on the chart), Eddy Duchin (reaching #12), and Al Donohue (reaching #16). The song later charted as #11 in 1952 by The Four Aces, as #57 in 1956 by Larry Maddox, as #18 in 1961 by The Cleftones, and as #25 in 1961 by Jan and Dean. Many other versions have been recorded.

<doc id="6263829" title="Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1940" nonfiltered="978" processed="964" dbindex="1480986">
The Louisiana gubernatorial election of 1940 was held in two rounds on January 16 and February 20, 1940.  Like most Southern states between Reconstruction and the civil rights era, Louisiana's
Republican Party was virtually nonexistent in terms of electoral
support.   This meant that the two Democratic Party primaries held on these dates were the real contest over who would be governor.  The election resulted in the defeat of Earl K. Long and the election of Sam H. Jones as governor of Louisiana on a reform platform.

 Candidates .
Incumbent governor Earl K. Long had succeeded to the office in 1939 after the resignation of governor Richard W. Leche and was running for a full term.  He was endorsed by the Louisiana Democratic Organization, which consisted of the machine created by his brother Huey Long as well as the powerful New Orleans Regular Democratic Organization.

Lake Charles attorney Sam H. Jones was recruited as a candidate by the anti-Long forces, who were gaining in strength in the aftermath of the 'Louisiana Scandals' associated with Leche.  He was endorsed by 'good government' groups, conservatives, and others opposed to the policies and actions of the Longs.  He campaigned on a platform of good government, opening of state books to public inspection, a merit-based state civil service, and the abolition of Long's 'deduct' system and patronage appointments.

State Senator James A. Noe ran as the "genuine Huey Long candidate" charging that Leche and Earl Long has betrayed the Long legacy with their corruption.  His campaign was particularly popular among North Louisiana farmers and former supporters of Huey Long disillusioned with the corruption of his successors.

Hammond attorney James H. Morrison had little support outside the Florida Parishes.  He ran a humorous anti-Long campaign, with campaign stops featuring a 'convict parade' of men in prison stripes representing Long, Leche, and Robert Maestri.

New Orleans attorney Vincent Moseley had no organized political backing and was not generally seen as a serious candidate.

 Campaign .
The focus of the campaign was the ongoing 'Louisiana Scandals' which implicated former governor Richard W. Leche - and by extension Earl K. Long - in widespread corruption.   Jones's main campaign focus was a moralistic crusade against corruption, and the state's newspapers featured him in overwhelmingly positive coverage.  Behind the scenes, though, Jones enlisted the aid of veteran politicos who were themselves implicated in questionable dealings.  He refused to criticize Huey Long, saying that "I am not running against a dead man.  I am running against a gang of rascals as live as any gang that ever lived, and I'm running to clean out every one of them."  Jones also promised to expand some of the Long programs, including teacher salary increases and a new old-age pension.

Earl Long made use of the Louisiana Progress newspaper he had inherited from his brother, as well as state publications like the Louisiana Conservation Review.  He also made extensive speaking tours throughout the state's rural areas, making colorful attacks on the big-city newspapers and calling Jones a tool of corporate interests.  

Jones got most of his funding from wealthy 'good-government' supporters, while Long's funding came from state employee deductions, oil and gas companies, and contributions from organized crime.

After the first round of voting, Noe endorsed Jones after the two struck a deal in which the 'good-government' Jones promised Noe half of the state's patronage appointments in exchange for his support.  Long called a special session of the legislature to pass several spending increases for social programs and some reform bills in an effort to influence runoff voters.  But Long refused to  include a pay raise for teachers, alienating a large voting bloc in the process. 

 Results  .
First Democratic Party Primary, January 16


Second Democratic Party Primary, February 20


Despite Long's promises of increased social programs, voters were still outraged over the recent corruption scandals and were unwilling to believe Earl Long's claims that he had had nothing to do with the scandals.   Jones's victory ended twelve years of Longite governors in Louisiana.

SH 9 was one of the original twenty six state highways proposed in 1917, overlaid on top of the 'Puget Sound-Gulf Highway.'  In 1919 the routing follows the present day U.S. Route 87 from Amarillo, through Canyon, Plainview, Lubbock, Big Spring, San Angelo, Brady, Mason, Fredericksburg, into San Antonio.  From San Antonio, it follows U.S. Route 181 from San Antonio, to Sinton and terminated in Corpus Christi.  

In 1919 the direct segment between San Angelo and Brady had not yet been built, so SH 9 was rerouted through Paint Rock for a short time (The segment would be completed by 1922).  Much like other highways at the time, multiple alternate routings has been created using the same number, and SH 9 was no exception.  From San Antonio, the second route left the city south via Pleasanton Road, merging with present day U.S. Route 281 from Las Gallinas through Pleasanton splitting off onto present day Interstate 37 into Oakville.  It continued west on SH 234 into Odem, and south on United States Highway 77 back to I-37 to its terminus in Corpus Christi.

By 1922 a third routing, signed as SH 9A was created alongside the previous two, overrunning the ambitious SH 12 route from Skidmore to Alice, and continuing south to its terminus in Pharr.

In 1926, U.S. Route 385 (Later US 87) was overlaid on the original routing from Amarillo to San Antonio.  From there, the original routing was resigned as SH 16 and had U.S. Route 181 overlaid on top of that.  The second routing retained the SH 9 designation, continuing the numbering into Corpus Christi that way.  The third routing was given its SH 12 assignment back from Skidmore to Alice, assigned SH 66 from Alice to Pharr, and both segments were overlaid with US 96 (Later SH 359 and US 281).  In 1933, an extension to SH 9 was being built from Amarillo to Stratford into Oklahoma.  This would eventually be overlaid with U.S. Route 287.

By 1939 most of SH 9 was cancelled, leaving only the Three Rivers-Corpus Christi segment to the old highway.  With the completion of I-37 in 1971, SH 9 was cancelled, and has never been reassigned.

Qur'an reading is the reading (tarteel, tajwid, or taghbir) aloud, reciting, or chanting of portions of the Qur'an. It is not considered music by Muslims and when recited the style  is structurally disimilar from music (even secular Arab music). The reciter is called a muqri' , t l , murattil, mujawwid, or most commonly a qari. (Touma 1996, p.153-154)

Recitation (singing of the Qur'an is strictly forbidden in Islam) must be done according to rules of pronunciation, intonation, and caesuras established by the Prophet Muhammad, though first recorded in the eight century CE. The most popular reading is that of Hafs on the authority of `asim. Qur'an reading may be based on one to three tones only. Similarly, each melodic passage centers on a single tone level, but the melodic contour and melodic passages are largely shaped by the reading rules, creating passages of different lengths whose temporal expansion is defined through caesuras. Skilled readers may read professionally for mosques in cities, although being paid for reciting the Qur'an is prohibited by Islam. 

The Qur'an is marked with twenty-six symbols, circles, rectangles, dashes and letters, some in color. These are written above, below, or beside the letters of the alphabet . They indicate the pronunciation of consonants, whether the blending of neighboring or adjacent consonants is allowed, and where recitation pauses and caesuras are forbidden and possible (ibid, p.155).
In this last respect their function is analogous to that of Biblical cantillation marks, but unlike these they do not constitute a word-for-word notation of musical motifs.

<doc id="8649979" title="Falling Apart (novel)" nonfiltered="982" processed="968" dbindex="1480990">
Falling Apart is a novel by Jacqueline Wilson aimed at teenage readers. It was published in 1989, and is now out of print. However, it can still be purchased on the internet; there are usually second-hand copies available.

The story concerns the relationship between Tina, a 15-year-old girl, and 17-year-old Simon. It is told in the present tense, and the third person. The plot runs along two timelines: the story begins in the present, but a great deal of the novel is retrospective, telling the tale of Tina and Simon's relationship in flashback form. 




 Main Characters .


Tina Brown is a 15-year-old girl from a working-class background, and the protagonist of Falling Apart. She is intelligent, but uninspired by education; she has fallen behind in her schoolwork. She is troubled by the death of her twin brother years beforehand, often experiencing nightmares, and has become withdrawn, with no close friends. Her mother's depression and lack of attention towards her has exacerbated her unhappiness.

Simon Trafford is the first boy Tina has ever loved. He attends the local public school and is studying for five 'A'-levels. He has a stable family background and good prospects. Tina is his first real girlfriend.

Adam is Simon's classmate; they have been best friends from a very early age. Adam is a bit of a troublemaker, though a very charming one, and disregards any emotions Tina feels, perhaps because he looks down upon her for attending the comprehensive school; perhaps because he is jealous of the attention and time she receives from his best friend.

Tim is Tina's deceased twin brother. When he was alive, they were very happy, popular, children, but his death in an accident when the twins were seven has cast a dark shadow over the family.

Jan is Tina's older sister. In contrast to Tina, she is very focused on schoolwork; she has academic ambitions that may be curtailed by her family's financial situation. She is opinionated and has some feminist ideals. She cares deeply for Tina and tries to encourage her to improve her schoolwork and to develop ambitions; she also tries to protect her from what she perceives as threatening forces.

Louise is Tina's oldest sister. She is married to Greg and has a baby, Carly. She became pregnant accidentally, which led to the marriage, and although she loves Carly a great deal, her relationship with Greg is sometimes strained, and Louise feels she has missed out on opportunities by having a family when she is so young. ;

Tina's mother relies on antidepressants and tranquilisers; she has never got over the death of her son, Tim, and appears to ignore Tina; perhaps even to resent her.

Tina's father tries to focus on the positives in their lives, and the surviving children in the family, but is unable to lift his wife's spirits.




 Plot Summary .


: Plot and/or ending details follow.














The present time.


At the beginning of the novel, Tina is preparing to kill herself. The trigger for her suicide attempt is the break up of her relationship with Simon, although there are other significant contributions to her unhappiness: her mother has been in a decline since the death of Tina's twin brother, Tim, and the family has crumbled as a result. Tina doesn't have any close friends at school, feeling unable to connect with the girls there. 

Tina watches television, and tries to eat a take away dinner, but all the while she is contemplating the nature of death, and the details of how she will take her own life. She has stolen medication, in the form of pills, from her chronically depressed mother. After deliberating over suicide notes, she takes an overdose of the pills and begins to hallucinate, believing that the lurid floral pattern on her bedclothes is spreading over her and strangling her.

At this point, a new chapter starts and the backstory is told by means of flashback.

The events of the recent past.

Tina and her sister Jan encounter two boys from the local fee-paying boys' boarding school, St. Christopher's, on their way to school one day. The boys wave at Tina, but Jan warns her to take no notice of them, believing that the boys from St. Christopher's only see girls from their comprehensive school as 'handkerchiefs' (i.e. to be taken advantage of), and not as people of value in themselves.

Tina meets the boys, Adam and Simon, again, by chance, and begins to talk to Simon. They bond over a conversation about pets and family, which is inspired by a delivery of new puppies to the local pet shop. Tina reveals that she doesn't get on well with her mother. Simon seems to be from a different world; he is upper-middle class, academic, and a sixth-former with prospects of attending Cambridge University. Despite the differences in background, the two get along well and arrange to meet again.

Simon and Tina forge a relationship; they sleep together, albeit outside in an enclosed section of the local cemetery, which becomes their special place. Tina tells Simon that she loves him, which takes him by surprise. She also confides in him the problems that she rarely discusses with anyone:  that her twin brother died in an accident several years earlier, and her mother has never recovered, almost failing to recognise Tina as a person at all. Simon is genuinely shocked and concerned at her troubles; they are far removed from his sheltered life, good prospects, and happy family. Tina is bright, but she lacks ambition, and finds herself unable to focus on schoolwork in the way in which teachers demand; she has fallen behind. Simon's rather old-fashioned use of language, and the way in which his speech is littered with academic and literary references, alienates Tina and makes her self-conscious.

We are told that although Tina has had plenty of interest from boys in recent years, she hasn't seen the point of relationships until meeting Simon; he's the only one she has felt affection for, and wanted to become involved with. 

One night, Tina offers to babysit for her oldest sister, 18-year-old Louise, so that Simon and she can have a place to themselves for the evening; they have always had to meet outside, because Tina can't face the prospect of taking Simon to her family home; she keeps him a secret from them for as long as possible. Simon is not allowed to take visitors into his school. Simon has expressed his surprise at Tina's sister being married and having a child at her young age, as though it wouldn't happen in his social circles. Tina is worried that he will find Louise's decor tacky and tasteless.

After a few weeks, the Christmas holidays are approaching. Simon fails to invite her to an end-of-term dance. Tina only learns of this event through Adam, who seems to want to cause trouble between them. Simon tells Tina that he will take one of Adam's female friends, Caroline, but that she isn't as pretty or charming or natural as Tina, and she is not under any threat of being replaced.

Simon, as a boarder, has to travel elsewhere in the country to his home. Tina is devastated that he is leaving, and asks him to contact her every day. He gives her an expensive toy dog as a Christmas present, and she buys him a sweater, and cross-stitches its label with a loving message, which takes her a long time. He responds at first but then his contact tails off completely, despite Tina's letters. She finds his family's telephone number through directory enquiries and calls, discovering that Simon has been away with a group of friends.

Simon continues to ignore her when he returns to Tina's town. After she pursues him, he does meet with her, but is ungracious and lacking the gentle manner he had before. He then tells her that he has met someone else and that their relationship is over. The other girl is Caroline, the girl at the dance. Simon tells Tina that Caroline is more on his wavelength, with the same interests, and also with prospects of attending Cambridge, and that Tina in comparison was good fun, but not nearly as significant. Tina is horrified. Simon is unable to cope with the intensity of her feeling, and the realisation of the huge impact he has made upon an already troubled girl; he cries, and leaves.

Tina is unable to accept that the relationship is over, and pursues Simon further. It transpires that Simon only became involved with Tina when Adam made a bet that he would be able to seduce her, which seems to prove Jan's theory regarding their attitudes to girls in a different social class. However, Simon then explains that he lost the bet, because he did develop genuine feelings for Tina and continued to see her. He admits that he was surprised by her depth of character, as though he had thought that local girls had no sensitivity or personality. 

Tina is inconsolable; Jan and Louise's extensive efforts to comfort her fail. Tina finds herself unable to stay in school, and unable to function, and in desperation begins to hoard her mother's antidepressants in preperation for her suicide bid.

Returning to the present.

When we arrive back in the present time, Tina is in hospital. She is found in time and is making a slow recovery. Jan is furious that Simon's carelessness led to her being in this state, and has showed him the suicide note addressed to him, but he is too distraught to visit her. Adam comes along instead, and despite his usual show of light-heartedness, it is clear that he realises the seriousness of the situation. 

Tina's mother is initially very angry with her, considering her to be selfish, but then appears to soften and feel a sympathy. Tina agrees to counselling. The ending of the novel is rather ambivalent; Tina appears to realise that she is a whole person, despite losing Tim and Simon, and she finds enough emotional energy to joke with her sisters, but she is still far from being completely healed, or completely over Simon.

 Parallels between Tina and Tess .

Simon has a habit of making literary allusions, and the one that Tina seizes upon is his comparison of herself with Tess of the d'Urbervilles. He is reminded of Tess when Tina wears a white dress and looks like an archetypal pure woman. He also draws attention to red shoes that Tina wears, explaining that there are little touches of red throughout Thomas Hardy's novel - "it's all very symbolic", he says.

Tina is keen to hear what becomes of the woman she resembles, and Simon laughingly recounts Tess's fate. Although Simon is merely playing with cultural references, as is no doubt encouraged within his social circle, Tina does indeed mirror Tess: Simon treats Tina fairly carelessly, without considering how his actions will affect her, in the same way that the men in Tess's life fail to see Tess as a whole person in her own right, and largely disregard the consequences of the way they treat her until it is 'too late'. 

In addition, Tina, like Tess, suffers more greatly because she is working-class - she is not, seemingly, expected to have as complex or intelligent a character as middle-class girls, and she is marginalised and exploited.

Buddhist art.

Buddhist art originated in the Indian subcontinent in the centuries following the life of the historical Gautama Buddha in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world.
A first, essentially Indian, aniconic phase (avoiding direct representations of the Buddha), was followed from around the 1st century CE by an iconic phase (with direct representations of the Buddha). From that time, Buddhist art diversified and evolved as it adapted to the new countries where the faith was expanding. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam.

Buddhist architecture.

Buddhist religious architecture most notably developed in the South Asia in the third century BCE.

Two types of structures are associated with early Buddhism: stupas and viharas. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the Buddha. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of Ajanta and Ellora (Maharashtra). Viharas were developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalised Buddhist monasticism. An existing example is at N land , (Bihar).

Buddhist temples were developed rather later and outside South Asia, where Buddhism gradually declined from the early centuries CE onwards, though an early example is that of the Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya in Bihar.

Buddhist music.

Buddhist music prominently includes Honkyoku, Buddhist chant, and Shomyo. Honkyoku are the pieces of shakuhachiyoku for enlightenment and alms as early as the 13th century.

Buddhist chant is the chant used in or inspired by Buddhism, including many genres in many cultures. It includes:
Repetition of the name of Amit bha in Pure Land Buddhism. ;
Shomyo in Japanese Tendai and Shingon Buddhism. ;
Throat singing in Tibetan Buddhist chant.

Musical chanting, most often in Tibetan or Sanskrit, is an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables.

Shomyo (  ) is a style of Japanese Buddhist chant; mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

Many ritual musical instruments are used in association with Buddhist practice including singing bowls, bells, tingsha, drums, cymbals, wind instruments and others.

Buddhist cuisine.

Buddhist cuisine is a kind of cuisine mainly for the believers of Buddhism. It is known as zh i cài (zh i means "purification" or "discipline", cai means "cuisine" or "vegetable") in China, and sh jin ry ri (sh jin means "devotion", ry ri means "cuisine") in Japan, and by many other names in other countries. Due to the understanding of animals as conscious and suffering beings, many Buddhists do not kill animals and many also do not eat meat (other than that from those who died naturally, and from species where the consumption of brethren is not troubling to the still living). Certain major Mahayana sutras show the Buddha forcefully denouncing meat-consumption and advocating vegetarianism (vegetarianism in Buddhism). Some Mah y na Buddhists in China and Vietnam also avoid eating strong-smelling plants such as onion, garlic, chives, shallot, and leek, and refer to these as wu hun (  , 'Five Spices'). Buddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as "seitan" or "wheat meat", soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, and other plant products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world.

You Better Shop Around, Part 1 is the 101st episode of Married... with Children during the 5th season of the long running series. The Original airdate of the episode was April 14, 1991. This episode's Production Code is 519.


 Plot . 
At the beginning of the episode the Bundy Family is caught in a rigorous Chicago heat wave. Al's solution to the problem is sitting in a kiddie pool while his other family members fan him. After denying his family's request to buy a good air conditioner, Al brings home a vintage Kaiser air conditioner from World War II Germany. His family is still not satisfied with the air conditioner Al brings home, and the excessive amount of power needed makes Al steal electricity from the City's transformer, which causes a black out in the neighborhood. Al sets Plan B into place, which is living in the local supermarket "Foodie's". Al encounters a beautiful young blonde woman, and makes her bend over constantly by throwing food on the floor and telling her she dropped it. A stockboy becomes suspicious of the Bundy's ways, so Al tells him that he is a cheese theft agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation going undercover to catch "The Velveeta Bandit of the Midwest". The stockboy is still uncertain of Al's motives since the suspected "Velveeta Bandit of the Midwest" is an elderly woman named Mrs. Gillis who has shopped at "Foodie's" for over ten years. Al frames Mrs. Gillis by placing a jar of nacho cheese in her purse, but the stockboy still turns Al in to the store manager. The manager tells Al that he has to buy something in cash due to the fact that Al's checks have been notorious to bounce, or he and his family would go to county jail. Al decides to buy a piece of gum for 18 cents, and finds that his neighbor Marcy D'Arcy is ahead of him in line. After asking if he could cut her because he only has a piece of gum, Marcy refuses, then in a last ditch effort by Al, he diverts her attention by pointing out a National Enquirer Headline and cuts ahead of her. The stick of gum is purchased and a siren sounds. The Bundys put there hands up in the air like they usually do when they hear a siren. Al then learns that he is the 1,000,000th "Foodie's" customer, giving him a $1,000 dollar shopping spree. Al decides that he can use the $1,000 to buy a new air conditioner. Marcy disagrees with Al being awarded the 1,000,000th customer prize and says that she was next in line, which would rightfully award her the $1,000 shopping spree. Marcy also complains that she has shopped at "Foodie's" for years, and that she knows the "Foodie's Jingle" by heart. The president of Foodie's tries to come up with a way to settle the problem. Marcy suggests that they both get shopping sprees. The president then claims that that isn't "fair for Foodie's". The conflict is then said to be resolved with Al and Marcy both going on the shopping spree, but whoever gets $1,000 worth of groceries first gets to keep them. The episode then ends abruptly with a "To Be Continued".

Trivia.
The method suggested to resolve the situation dealing with the winner of the shopping spree is similar to the main concept of the game show Supermarket Sweep, in which the contestants go on a shopping spree around a supermarket with the hopes of racking up the highest product value.
This marks the sixth time in Married... With Children's history where the episode is split into two separate parts.
The website TV.com lists "You Better Shop Around" as the 8th most popular episode ever, receiving a review of 9.2 out of a possible 10.

DVD Release.
The episode "You Better Shop Around, Part 1" is featured in the "Most Outrageous Episodes" DVD. Part 2 of the episode is also featured on the "Most Outrageous Episodes" DVD.

Marika Ninou (Greek:             ) was a Greek rembetiko and laiko singer, born Evangelia Nikolaidou (Greek:                     ) in the Caucasus, 1918.

Ninou emigrated to Athens from the Caucasus in 1947 and performed acrobatic feats with her troupe known as "the Ninou duo-and-a-half" that consisted of Ninou herself, her husband and their child.

In October, 1948, Stelakis Perpiniadis (Greek:                      ) brought her under his wing as a singer at the Florinda.

By 1949, Ninou began working with Vassilis Tsitsanis at Fat Jimmy's, a place that would serve to play a decisive role in both their lives. Ninou was a legendary post-rembetiko singer with a great influence on Tsitsanis, with the Tsitsanis-Ninou pairing coming to possess a very special place in the history of the laiko music of Greece.

In October, 1951, Ninou performed with Tsitsanis in Constantinople, but after this trip, they suddenly decided to go their separate ways. For Ninou, that meant heading to the USA where she performed with Kostas Kaplani (Greek:              ) for two years.

Before heading off to the USA, she underwent a cancer operation in Athens. Nonetheless, her cancer spread rapidly in the USA and she returned to Greece where she worked under great pain for a short while before succumbing to her illness at 38 years of age, on Sunday the 23rd of February, 1957.

Ninou possessed a high-pitced voice of substantial body and volume and impeccable tonality, and sang with emotional intensity.

Merrill Singer is a medical anthropologist known for his research on substance abuse, HIV/AIDS, health disparities, and minority health. Director of the Center for Community Health Research at the Hispanic Health Council  in Hartford, CT, he helped to develop the theoretical perspective within medical anthropology known as critial medical anthropology. Dr. Singer also developed the public health concepts of syndemics and oppression illness. 

The first of these terms refers to the clustering of diseases in populations and the biological interaction of diseases in individual bodies. Moreover, the term syndemics also points to the determinant importance of social conditions in disease concentrations, interactions, and health consequences. In syndemics, the interaction of diseases or other adverse health conditions commonly arises because of adverse social conditions (e.g., poverty, exploitative, stigmatization, oppressive social relationships) that put socially devalued groups at heightened risk. The term oppression illness refers to the internalization of social discrimination and the health consequences of coming to accept one does not deserve to be healthy. 

In addition to his work at the Hispanic Health Council, Dr. Singer is affiliated with the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) at Yale University and the Center for Health/HIV Intervention and Prevention (CHIP) at the University of Connecticut. Dr. Singer, in addition, is a senior research scientist in the department of anthropology at the University of Connecticut.

 Research .
Dr. Singer has been the Principal Investigator on a continuous series of federal and foundation funded drinking, drug use, and AIDS prevention grants since 1984, and currently is the Principal Investigator on a CDC-funded study designed to monitor emergent drug use trends and to build community health responses to identified public health risk. Additionally, he is Co-investigator on four studies:
Sexual  communication and risk among inner city young adults (CDC);
Assessing the implementation of oral HIV testing among injection drug users in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil (NIDA);
Ethical issues in research with active drug users (NIDA);
Testing the implementation of hepatitis B vaccination of injection drug users in Hartford and Chicago (NIDA).

 Family.
Dr. Singer is the father of two children, Jacob Hillis Singer and Elyse Ona Singer; both are in college.

 Publications.
Dr. Singer s three most recent books are Something Dangerous: Emergent and Changing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health, The Face of Social Suffering: Life History of a Street Drug Addict (Waveland Press, 2005) and New Drugs on the Street (Haworth Press, 2005). Additionally, he has published over 135 scholarly articles and 40 book chapters.  Dr. Singer was selected as the first recipient of the Practicing Anthropology Award by the Society for Medical Anthropology in 2004 and received a Career Recognition Award from the Society for the Anthropology of North America in 2005.  Previously he was awarded both the AIDS and Anthropology Paper Prize and the Rudoph Virchow Prize through the Society for Medical Anthropology. His other books include:

Lake Shala (also spelled Shalla) lies in Ethiopia south of Addis Ababa, in the Abijatta-Shalla National Park. According to the Statistical Abstract of Ethiopia for 1967/68, the lake is 28 kilometers long and 12 wide, with a surface area of 409 square kilometers. It has a maximum depth of 250 meters and is at an elevation of 1567 meters.

Known for the sulphur springs on the lake bed, its islands are inhabited by Great White Pelicans, one being known as Pelican Island.

Lake Shala is a beautiful and breathtaking Lake. On your way to the Lake, you will notice a unique blend of rich green and grassy fields. This area is frequented by various  sheep, donkeys and cows. The Lake is surrounded by hot springs filled with boiling water, and the earth surrounding the Lake is filled with cracks due to erosion and earthquakes. Due to the steam which evaporates from the boiling of water in the hot springs, the atmosphere is relatively foggy. 

At the far end of the Lake, you can see various types of flamingoes and birds that frequent the southern portion of the Lake Shala. Truly a breathtaking and naturally beautiful landscape of Ethiopia's environment.

Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, , was a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court found that Virginia's poll tax was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. The case was filed by Virginia resident Annie E. Harper.  After being dismissed by a district court, the case went to the United States Supreme Court.  In a 6-3 vote, the court ruled in favor of Ms. Harper.  The court noted that  a state violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth. 

This ruling reversed a prior decision by the court, Breedlove v. Suttles, , which supported poll taxes.

Frank McIntyre (January 5, 1865 - February 16, 1944) was an American military officer who served for many years as Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, responsible for federal administration of the Philippines and Puerto Rico.

McIntyre was born in Montgomery, Ala., and educated at the United States Military Academy.  He entered the United States army as a second lieutenant in the 19th Infantry, serving in various ranks until he attained that of brigadier-general in 1912.  Meanwhile he saw duty at different posts, chiefly on the Mexican border, until the war with Spain, in which he participated in the Porto Rico expedition in 1898.  McIntyre served in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, after which he served with the general staff.

McIntyre was attached to the Bureau of Insular Affairs in 1905 and became its Chief in 1912, relieving General Clarence Ransom Edwards.  During the War in Europe he was assistant chief of staff with the rank of major-general.  McIntyre served as Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs and played a significant role in the governance of the Philippines and Puerto Rico throughout this period.  With respect to Puerto Rico, McIntyre wavered on the wisdom of granting United States citizenship to Puerto Ricans but ultimately supported the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917. At times, McIntyre had strained relations with other officials in Puerto Rico, such as U.S. District Judge Peter J. Hamilton during the 1910's and Governor E. Mont Reily during the 1920's.  

McIntyre retired from the Army in 1929 and died in 1944. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Operation Agatha was a large scale military operation conducted by the British authorities in Palestine starting on Saturday, June 29, 1946. One objective was to dissuade the Haganah, and particularly its operational arm the Palmach, from undertaking further attacks against British troops and officials. In this, they were successful.
  
(Alan Cunningham, Palestine-The Last Days of the Mandate, International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944), Vol. 24, No. 4 (Oct., 1948), p. 485.)

However, the more extreme groups, the LEHI (Stern Gang) and the Irgun Tzvai Leumi, headed by future Prime Minister Menachem Begin, continued and even intensified their attacks. (http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/defense.html)

In a detailed account of the King David Hotel Bombing, Thurston Clarke asserts that the British government also wished to bolster army morale and forestall a coup d'etat in which community leaders would unilaterally proclaim a Jewish state.

(Clarke, By Blood and Fire, Putnam, 1981, Ch.6.)

The Agatha operation is sometimes called Black Sabbath or Black Saturday because it began on the Jewish sabbath. Soldiers and police searched for arms and made arrests in Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv, and Haifa, and in several dozen settlements. (The total number of British security forces is variously reported as 10,000, 17,000, and 25,000.) The semi-official Jewish Agency was raided. About 2,700 individuals were arrested. 

It was a tense time. On June 16, 1946 the Palmach blew up eight international roadway and rail bridges. On June 17, the LEHI attacked railway operations in Haifa. Shortly afterwards, the Irgun kidnapped six British officers. One officer escaped, and two were released. The Irgun announced that the remaining officers would be released only in exchange for the commutation of death sentences for two Irgun members.(http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/defense.html) (After Agatha ended, the officers were released, and High Commissioner Alan Cunningham commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment.)

The British operations were extensive. Low flying planes circled Jerusalem. Roadblocks were maintained, trains were flagged down, and passengers were evacuated and escorted home.  Special licenses were required for the operations of emergency vehicles. Curfews were imposed. Agatha triggered echoes of the Holocaust in the minds of many people. Women ripped their clothing to expose concentration camp tattoos. There were incidents of people in the settlements herded into cages while screaming that this was what the Nazis did. A minority among the British troops exacerbated the situation by shouting "Heil Hitler," scrawling swastikas on walls, and referring to gas chambers while conducting searches. (Clarke, ibid., pp.68-69) Arms caches were discovered. At Kibbutz Yagur, the troops found more than 300 rifles, some 100 2-inch mortars, more than 400,000 bullets, some 5,000 grenades and 78 revolvers. The arms were displayed at a press conference, and all the men of Yagur were arrested. (http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac09.htm)

The Irgun retaliated for Operation Agatha by bombing the south wing of the King David Hotel, which was the headquarters of the British government in Palestine.

<doc id="605116" title="L. Shankar" nonfiltered="995" processed="981" dbindex="1481004">
Lakshminarayana Shankar (born April 26 1950), or L. Shankar, is an Indian violinist. He was born in Madras, South India. Growing up in Sri Lanka where his father V. Lakshminaraya Iyer was a professor at the Jaffna College of Music, Shankar was exposed to Carnatic music from an early age. His father was an esteemed violinist, his mother L. Seethalakshmi played the veena and all his five older siblings were also proficient in music. The most well known of his brothers is L. Subramaniam who has released a number of records on his own.  

At the age of seven L. Shankar gave his first public concert. He gained considerable reputation in his early youth as an accompanist to some of the most eminent names in Carnatic music such as Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Chembai Vaithyanatha Baghavatar, Palghat Mani Iyer and Alathur Srinivasa lyer. Following the ethnic riots of 1953 his family moved back to India. 

After obtaining a bachelor's degree in physics in India, Shankar moved to America in 1969 and earned a doctorate in ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University, where he met jazz musicians like Ornette Coleman, Jimmy Garrison, and John McLaughlin while working as a teaching assistant and concert master of the university chamber orchestra. In 1975 Shankar and McLaughlin founded Shakti pioneering a groundbreaking and highly influential east-meets-west collaborative, fluid sound that managed to successfully combine seemingly incompatible traditions. After the disbanding of Shakti in 1978 Shankar founded his own band - The Epidemics. His first solo album, Touch Me There, was produced by Frank Zappa in 1979.

During the 1980s, Shankar recorded periodically as a leader, doing both jazz-based material and Indian classical music. His 1980 release of the album Who's To Know on ECM introduced the unique sound of his own invention, the ten-string, stereophonic double violin. This instrument, designed by Shankar and built by noted guitar maker Ken Parker, covers the entire orchestral range, including double bass, cello, viola and violin. He has recently developed a newer version of his instrument which is much lighter than the original. 

In 1994 Shankar won the Grammy for  in which he co-wrote 13 of the tracks with Peter Gabriel. Shankar has performed on several of Peter Gabriel's records such as So and Us. In 1996 Shankar, with fellow-violinist Gingger, who is his niece (daughter of his older brother L. Subramaniam) toured as the duo "Shankar & Gingger".

Shankar has played with some of the greatest musical contemporaries of his time, including Echo and the Bunnymen, Talking Heads, Frank Zappa, Peter Gabriel, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Bruce Springsteen, Van Morrison, Stewart Copeland, Yoko Ono, John Waite, Steve Vai, Ginger Baker, Toto, Nils Lofgren, and Sting. He has also effortlessly married Eastern and Western influences, assimilating Carnatic music with pop, rock, jazz and contemporary world music. "Ultimately, I would like to bring the East and West together. That, I think, is my role," says Shankar. Shankar has also provided the vocals for the opening credit music and various other themes in the hit TV series Heroes.

"The violin is no longer a secondary instrument...today, it is a very big solo instrument," says Shankar.

<doc id="353192" title="N8 road" nonfiltered="997" processed="983" dbindex="1481006">
In Belgium, the N8 is the old road from Brussels to Koksijde, passing Ninove, Oudenaarde, Kortrijk, Ypres and Veurne.



The N8 road is a National Primary Route in the Republic of Ireland connecting Cork with Dublin (via the N7). The motorway section bypassing Fermoy and Rathcormac is designated the M8 motorway. The route commences just south of Portlaoise along the M7 motorway (N7), and reaches Cork via the midlands and Golden Vale of Ireland, through counties Laois, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick and Cork. As of 2006 the general specification of the northern part of the route would be regarded as below the western European standard for such a priority route.

Route through Laois and Tipperary.



Junction 17 on the N7 route (M7 motorway from Naas to past Portlaoise) at Togher marks the start of the N8 (see thumbnails).  Abbeyleix, some 20km (12.5 miles) south of this, is the first major settlement along the route. Indeed, the N8 passes through the centre of the town, via Stucker Hill, Market Square and Main Street. Further south again, the N8 passes through Durrow, County Laois, via The Square, Castle Street and Patrick Street. At Durrow, the N77 joins the N8 from the south. After Cullahill, the route enters County Kilkenny, running through Johnstown via Chapel Street, The Square and Urlingford Road. Urlingford is the last town in County Kilkenny for the N8, before it enters County Tipperary.

The N75, leaving the N8 at Turnpike provides access to nearby Thurles to the west.  The N8 continues southwest through Littleton and Horse and Jockey, meeting the N62 from Thurles at the latter. Cashel is bypassed to the west by a 4.4-mile (7km) dual carriageway opened in October 2004 (see thumnail). South of Cashel, the N8 joins the N74 to Tipperary Town, it then passes through New Inn, and follows the single-carriageway Cahir Bypass around the north and west of Cahir, where it crosses the Limerick Waterford railway line, and the corresponding N24 road.

N8/M8 through Limerick and Cork.

County Limerick is entered briefly at Kilbeheny, before the N8 enters County Cork on the approach to Mitchelstown. As of 2006, traffic on the N8 follows a relief road, opened in July 2006, around the north and west of the town, where it meets the N73 from Mallow. A more direct dual-carriageway bypass around the southeast of the town is planned.

South of Mitchelstown the N8 passes through Kilworth. A section of tolled motorway commences just south of this; the 17.5km (11 miles) M8 Rathcormac - Fermoy Bypass bypassing Fermoy and Rathcormac. The project opened on 2 October 2006 and includes a 450 metre long viaduct over the Blackwater Valley. The toll for cars currently costs ¤1.60. However, Direct Route (who operate the toll road) have said that only 11,000 vehicles per day use the road. Many motorists, in particular lorry drivers, drive through Fermoy, Rathcormack and Watergrasshill so as to avoid the toll. The Irish Road Haulage Association has advised its members not to use the toll road, as they claim it is too expensive. In Watergrasshill, traffic has increased by about 6,000 vehicles per day, of which 1,100 vehicles are lorries.  The reclassified former N8 is now the R639 road. Further south is the dual carriageway (non motorway) bypass of Watergrasshill (opened in September 2003). The dual carriageway continues into Cork city, bypassing Sallybrook and Glanmire. At Dunkettle Intake, the N8 meets the N25, the latter running south via the Jack Lynch Tunnel to a southern bypass of the city, and west to Waterford.

The N8 continues into Cork city via the Lower Glanmire Road, Water Street, Horgan's Quay, Penrose Quay, Brian Boru Bridge and Merchant's Quay (and the route returns via St. Patrick's Bridge, Bridge Street and McCurtain Street). The N8 ends where it meets the N22 at St. Patrick's Street.

M8 motorway and upgrades.


As of November 2006, four road schemes will complete the upgrade of the N8 (bypass of existing route) to dual carriageway/motorway. These schemes will provide new routes between Portlaoise and Cullahill, Cullahill and Cashel, Cashel and Mitchelstown, and Mitchelstown to Fermoy.

As regards the section of route between Portlaoise and Cullahill; a project is in planning as of 2006 to build motorway south of Portlaoise, with the N8 diverging from the M7 as the M8 motorway. This project, the Portlaoise/Castletown/Cullahill PPP Scheme, will extend motorway from Naas outside Dublin, to Cullahill on the N8 (the scheme is also on the N7, extending it from Portlaoise to Castletown). The motorway will be subject to toll south of Portlaoise on the M7 before the junction for the M8. Construction is due to begin in 2007.

A further 25 miles (40km) of high quality dual carriageway is under construction since 5th October 2006 between Cullahill and Cashel, connecting to the Cashel bypass opened in 2004. Of this 7 miles (11km) of the high quality dual carriageway between Cashel and Cullahill will be motorway. This stretch of motorway will be located between the two towns of Cullahill and Urlingford.

Construction started on 22nd May 2006 on 23 miles (37km) of high quality dual carriageway between Cashel and Mitchelstown, the Cashel/Mitchelstown Road Improvement project. The fourth remaining project on the N8/M8 corridor comprises 13.5 miles (22km) of "high quality" dual carriageway. This is to be built from east of Mitchelstown to north of Fermoy, as part of a Mitchelstown/Fermoy project in planning.

<doc id="959314" title="Boulton Paul Sidestrand" nonfiltered="998" processed="984" dbindex="1481007">
The Boulton Paul P.29 Sidestrand was a twin-engine biplane medium bomber of the Royal Air Force.  Named after a village on the Norfolk coast near Boulton & Paul's factory in Norwich, the Sidestrand first flew in 1926 and entered service in 1928.  It remained in service until 1936, only ever equipping one squadron; No. 101 Squadron RAF.  It was an agile and relatively fast aircraft that was capable of aerobatic manoeuvres such as loops, rolls and spins.

Only 20 Sidestrands were ever built.  The first two, essentially prototypes, were designated the Sidestrand Mk I.  Originally intended to be powered by two Napier Lion inline engines, the Mk I was eventually fitted with 425 hp (317 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI radial engines which also powered the first six production Sidestrands, designated the Sidestrand Mk II.  The remaining 12 aircraft were powered by 460 hp (343 kW) Jupiter VIIFs and were designated the Sidestrand Mk III.  The six Mk IIs were also re-engined to bring them up to the Mk III specification.

The Sidestrand had three open defensive gun positions; nose, dorsal and ventral.  The crew usually consisted of three personnel; pilot, nose gunner and a single gunner for the dorsal or ventral positions, the choice depending on where each individual plane was intended to fly in a formation.  Armament for each position was a single .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis gun.  The Sidestrand's bombload was limited to 1,050 lb (476 kg) which did not compare favourably with its contemporaries such as the Martin B-10.

In the early 1930s a Sidestrand Mk III was fitted with Bristol Pegasus IM3 engines.  This was intended to become the Sidestrand Mk IV, but eventually became the prototype for the redeveloped Boulton Paul Overstrand which would begin replacing the Sidestrand in service in 1936.

Nathan McKinnon (b. November 17, 1981) is a celebrated Canadian political scientist, comedian, author, philanthropist, and producer of works.  

In all disciplines, McKinnon's output is acknowledged for its ingenuity, obliquity, and consummate equivocality.  In 2005 and 2001 respectively, he was nominated top finalist for both the Giller and Ford-Mercury Prize.  


 Biography .
Nathan McKinnon was born to third-generation Turkish-Armenian parents in Regina, Saskatchewan, the setting for many of his graphic novels.  He attended the University of Saskatchewan for five years, where he is said to have made some of his most significant contributions to the field of political science.

 Feuds and Controversies .
McKinnon has publicly rebuked fellow Saskatoon artist John Shelling in numerous interviews, columns, and public lectures.  Their rivalry dates back to the mid-90s, when the two fell into conflict over the artistic direction of The Days of Yore, their intermittently successful industrial techno outfit.

Beyond his horiffic smell, the only blemish of his career came in 2000 when reports emerged that McKinnon had made antisemitic remarks in a University cafeteria. After investigation, officials concluded it was a simple misunderstanding. The final report stated that McKinnon, while eating his lunch, remarked that he hated "acidic juice". A passerby mistook his comment for "I hate Hasidic Jews."  No charges were pressed; to this day McKinnon maintains only a minor criminal record. 

Recently developed a feud with Saskatoon recording artist Maybe Smith over  moats. Mckinnon was quoted as saying "Smith is incorrigible!". 

 Recent Works .
His collaborative novelette 40, 000 Watts of Solid-State Power was overwhelmingly received by regional critics.  Many among the literary community consider the work his most imposing achievement to date.

McKinnon has been artistically associated with Vintage Wolf, an ambitiously influential art rock collective based out of Montreal, Canada.

 Current Status .
McKinnon currently resides in Saskatoon with his wife Alana, and his girlfriend Beatrix.

Bagnolet is a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 5.2 km. (3.2 miles) from the center of Paris. Its inhabitants are called Bagnoletais. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. 

History.
On January 1, 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, a small part of the commune of Bagnolet was annexed to the city of Paris. At the same time, the commune of Charonne was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Bagnolet, and Montreuil. Bagnolet received a small part of the territory of Charonne.

On July 24, 1867, a part of the territory of Bagnolet was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Romainville and a part of the territory of Pantin to create the commune of Les Lilas.

Transport.
Bagnolet is served by Gallieni station on Paris Metro line 3.

The Guaynabo Mets were a BSN professional basketball team from Puerto Rico.

The Mets began to play as basketball's original Santurce Crabbers. Before the 1976 season, they moved to Guaynabo. At first, they had to play at a local gymnasium in Isla Verde, a San Juan area somewhat far from Guaynabo.

The Mets were a force in Puerto Rican basketball during the 1980s. With such players as Fico Lopez, Mario Morales, José Sosa, Nestor Cora and many more, the Mets won championships in 1980, 1982 and 1989, while reaching the finals in 1981, 1983, and 1985. The reached the playoffs every year during that decade.

In 1983, their new home, the Mario Morales Coliseum, was inaugurated. Apart from the Mets' home games, the coliseum is also used for boxing, roller derby and musical acts. It features a large painting of Morales on the entrance.

The Mets reached the finals again in 1990 and 1993, losing both times to the Ponce Lions.

Economical problems forced the team out of the league by the early 2000s.

 1961 - Robert Dicke argues that carbon-based life can only arise when the gravitational force is small, because this is when burning stars exist; first use of the weak anthropic principle;
 1963 - Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar show that the steady state theory can explain the isotropy of the universe because deviations from isotropy and homogeneity decay exponentially in time;
 1964 - Fred Hoyle and Roger Tayler point out that the primordial helium abundance depends on the number of neutrinos.
 1965 - Hannes Alfvén proposes the now-discounted concept of ambiplasma to explain baryon asymmetry.

 1977 - Gary Steigman, David Schramm, and James Gunn examine the relation between the primordial helium abundance and number of neutrinos and claim that at most five lepton families can exist.
 1981 - Viacheslav Mukhanov and G. Chibisov propose that quantum fluctuations could lead to large scale structure in an inflationary universe;
 1981 - Alan Guth proposes the inflationary Big Bang universe as a possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems;
 1990 - Preliminary results from NASA's COBE mission confirm the cosmic microwave background radiation is an isotropic blackbody to an astonishing one part in 105 precision, thus eliminating the possibility of an integrated starlight model proposed for the background by steady state enthusiasts. ;
 1990s - Ground based cosmic microwave background experiments measure the first peak, determine that the universe is geometrically flat.
 1998 - Controversial evidence for the fine structure constant varying over the lifetime of the universe is first published.
 1998 - Adam Riess, Saul Perlmutter and others discover the cosmic acceleration in observations of Type Ia supernovae providing the first evidence for a non-zero cosmological constant. ;
 1999 - Measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation (most notably by the BOOMERanG experiment see Mauskopf et al., 1999, Melchiorri et al., 1999, de Bernardis et al. 2000) provide evidence for oscillations (peaks) in the anisotropy angular spectrum as expected in the standard model of cosmological structure formation. These results indicates that the geometry of the universe is flat. Together with large scale structure data, this provides complementary evidence for a non-zero cosmological constant.

Since 2000.

 2003 - NASA's WMAP takes more detailed pictures of the cosmic microwave background radiation than were obtained by the BOOMERanG experiment. The image can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error) and confirm that the Lambda-CDM model and the inflationary theory are correct.

 2006 - The long-awaited three-year WMAP results are released, confirming previous analysis, correcting several points, and including polarization data.

Vida is an unincorporated community in Lane County, Oregon, United States. It is located on Oregon State Route 126 and the McKenzie River.

According to Oregon Geographic Names, Vida was originally named "Gate Creek", but this caused confusion with a community of "Gates Creek" in Washington County, so the name of the postmaster's daughter was selected instead. The Vida post office was established in 1898.

Vida is home to the historic Goodpasture Bridge, a covered bridge that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  It is the second longest covered bridge in Oregon.

Hole-in-the-Ground is a large maar (explosion crater) in Lake County, central Oregon, 43°24.67'N,121°11.92'W, northeast of Crater Lake, near Oregon State Route 31.  

It is about 1600 meters (nearly a mile) across, a little longer N-S than E-W.  Its floor is about 150 meters below the surrounding ground level and has a rim that rises 35 to 65 meters above, the highest point on the east side.  The crater formed during the late Pleistocene, between 13,500 and 18,000 years ago, at which time the Fort Rock Basin was a lake and the location was near the shore.  Basaltic magma intruding near the surface flashed ground water to steam, which blew out overlying rock and soil, along with some juvenile material.  As material slid into the hole formed, it closed the vent and the process repeated, eventually forming the huge hole.  To the West is an even bigger maar, 1820 meters, but older and more eroded, called Big Hole.

<doc id="8945503" title="Bernhard von Gudden" nonfiltered="1008" processed="994" dbindex="1481017">
Johann Bernhard Aloys von Gudden (June 7, 1824 - June 13, 1886) was a German neuroanatomist and psychiatrist. He earned his doctorate from the University of Halle in 1848 and became an intern at the asylum  in Siegburg. From 1851 to 1855 he was a psychiatrist in the mental asylum at Illenau in Baden. From 1855 to 1869 he was director of the Unterfränkische Landes-Irrenanstalt mental institution in Werneck. In 1869 he was appointed director of the Burghölzli Hospital, and also a professor of psychiatry at the University of Zürich. Later in his career he was professor of psychiatry at the University of Munich.

Gudden made many contributions in the field of neuroanatomy, especially his work of mapping and describing the paths, connections, origins/termini and neuroanatomical centers of the cranial and optic nerve networks. The commissural fibers of the optic tract are eponymously called the commissure of Gudden. He is also credited for developing a specialized microtome for sectioning the brain for pathological study. Among his well-known students and assistants are Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), Franz Nissl (1860-1919), Auguste-Henri Forel (1848-1931), Sigbert Josef Maria Ganser (1853-1931) and Oskar Panizza (1853-1921).

As director of mental institutions, Gudden advocated a no-restraint policy, humane treatment of the mentally ill, communal social interaction amongst patients, and a well-trained medical staff. These were considered innovative, if not revolutionary ideas concerning mental health treatment in the mid-19th century. Gudden was a respected psychiatrist in Germany and was appointed personal physician to King Ludwig II of Bavaria. On June 13, 1886, Ludwig and Gudden were both found dead in the water near the shore of Lake Starnberg at 11:30 p.m. that night, allegedly drowned, possibly murdered. To this day the details of their deaths remain a mystery.

Gonville Bromhead (29 August 1845-9 February 1891) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Details.

He was a 33 years old lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Bromhead had a profound deafness, which had restricted his promotion opportunities to this point, it was this disability that prompted Bromhead to defer command to Chard during the Rorke's Drift Siege. 

On 22 and 23 January 1879 at Rorke's Drift, Natal, South Africa, Lieutenant Bromhead shared the command of the defenders of the post with an officer of the Royal Engineers (John Rouse Merriott Chard), setting a fine example and conducting himself with great gallantry in most trying circumstances.

Further information.

He later achieved the rank of Brevet-Major.  He was considered to be Irish, despite being born in Versailles, France, August 29, 1845.  His mother, Judith Christine Wood, was certainly Irish, being a native of Woodville, Co. Sligo.  However, his father's home was Thurlby Hall, north of Bassingham, near Lincoln.  He was known to be very hard of hearing.

In the 1964 film Zulu Gonville Bromhead was portrayed by Michael Caine, in his first starring role.

He died in India where he is buried in a military cemetery.  The church at Thurlby in Lincolnshire has a stained glass window dedicated to him. His grandfather, who fought at the Battle of Waterloo, is buried in its churchyard.  His Victoria Cross is displayed at the South Wales Borderers Museum (Brecon, Powys, Wales).

The personal journals kept by Bromhead, including those recorded during his action in the Zulu War and the defence of Rorke's Drift were burned by his family at some point between the 1940s and 1950s. The reason given was that they had become mouldy and nobody would have any interest in reading them.

Opera San Jose is the professional opera company in San Jose, California, USA,  founded in 1984 by Irene Dalis.  In 1988, it formed a resident company of principal artists, for which it has purchased fourteen apartment units to provide rent-free accommodation. Until 2004, the company performed in the Montgomery Theater in San Jose's Civic Auditorium complex.  One of the keys to the company's success over the years has been its fiscal prudence.

California Theatre.
The company opened its 2004 2005 season in the 1,100-seat California Theatre, a vaudeville and film theater that was originally built in 1927.  The theatre had been left vacant for many years and had decayed, but reopened in 2004 after a major restoration project done expressly for Opera San Jose and as the result of large donations. This came as a large relief to local historians, who feared that the building would be demolished, like many of the other historic buildings in the city center. It has been called one of the most beautiful theatres in the state.

Resident company.
In 1988, Opera San Jose formed a resident company of principal artists, for which it provides rent-free accommodation.  These artists are typically promising singers in the early years of their career.  They are given annual contracts & coaching and are expected to fill leading roles in the company's performances.  This program is modeled after similar programs in German regional opera companies.

Current resident artists.
The following artists are current members of the resident company:

Takleef is an Arabic word referring to the concept of accountability in Islamic legalism. In the Hindi and Urdu languages, the word also means difficulty.

There are five levels of requirements in Islam. The Muslim s accountability depends on the level of each requirement. 

Levels of Takleef.

 Fard (obligatory): Rewarded for doing the requirements and punished for not doing the requirement.
 Sunnah or mustahub (preferred): Rewarded for doing it while not punished for not doing it.
 Har m (forbidden): Rewarded for not doing it and punished for doing it.
 Makrouh (undesirable): Rewarded for not doing it but not punished for doing it.
 Mubah (permissible): No reward or punishment.

Accountability by Age.
A Muslim is accountable for his or her actions depending on his/her age, there are three major age groups: 

 Child (Birth to approx age 7): Nothing counts for or against. If the child dies they go to heaven. Only Hajj is counted as Sunnah (does not satisfy Hajj requirement). Children are not obliged to pray or fast.
 Tamayez (Age of Distinction) - (age 7 to Puberty): Rewarded for good deeds while bad deeds are not counted. However, intentionally avoiding bad deeds is rewarded.
 Balugh (Puberty/adult): Fully accountable except whilst sleeping or if mentally ill. It is obligatory upon the parents to remind their children who reach puberty of these obligations.

Teenagers are not regarded as an age group. If they have stepped into puberty, then they are regarded as adults.

Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745 - 1812;                   ), was an Orthodox Rabbi, and the founder and first Rebbe of Chabad, a branch of Hasidic Judaism, then based in Liadi, Imperial Russia. He was the author of many works, and is best known for Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Tanya and his Siddur compiled according to the Arizal. He is also known as Shneur Zalman Baruchovitch of Liadi, or Reb Schneur Zalman or Baal HaTanya veShulchan Aruch or Alter Rebbe ("Old Rebbe" in Yiddish) or The Rav. 

Biography.

Rabbi Shneur Zalman was born in 1745 in the small town of Liozno, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (White Russia). He was a descendent of the mystic and philosopher Rabbi Judah Loew, the "Maharal of Prague". He was a prominent and youngest disciple of Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch, the "Great Maggid" who was in turn the successor of the founder of Hasidism, Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer known as the Baal Shem Tov ("Master the Good Name"). 

Until the age of twelve, he studied under Rabbi Issachar Ber, in Lyubavichi (Lubavitch); he distinguished himself as a Talmudist, such that his teacher sent him back home, informing his father that the boy could continue his studies without the aid of a teacher.  At age fifteen he married Sterna Segal, the daughter of Yehuda Leib Segal, a wealthy resident of Vitebsk - and he was then able to devote himself entirely to study. During these years, Shneur Zalman was introduced to mathematics, geometry and astronomy by two learned brothers, refugees from Bohemia, who had settled in Liozna. One of them was also a scholar of the Kabbalah. Thus, besides mastering Rabbinic literature, he also acquired a fair knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and Kabbalah.  

He became an adept in Isaac Luria's system of Kabbalah - and it is thought that this is when he became an admirer of Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch. For twelve years he lived in Rabbi Dovber's house, and took an active part in the propagation of Hasidism. During the latter portion of Rabbi Dovber s life, his students dispersed over Europe, and after Rabbi Dovber's passing, Rabbi Shneur Zalman became the leader of Hasidism in Lithuania. 

At the time Lithuania was the center of the misnagdim (opponents of Hasidism), and  Shneur Zalman  faced much opposition. In 1772, together with Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, he attempted to create a dialogue with the Vilna Gaon who led the Misnagdim and had launched a ban ("Cherem") against the Hasidim - this unfortunately failed. See Vilna Gaon: Antagonism to Hasidism; Hasidim and Mitnagdim.  Undaunted by this antagonism, he succeeded in creating a powerful network of Hasidic centers. He also involved himself in opposing Napoleon's advance on Russia by recruiting his dispiples to the Czar's army, and canvassing financial support for the Jewish settlements in the Land of Israel, then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. 

In 1797 following the death of the Gaon, leaders of the Vilna community falsely accused the Hasidim of subversive activities - on charges of supporting the Ottoman Empire, since he advocated sending charity to the Ottoman territory of Palestine. He was then imprisoned in St. Petersburg.  For three months he remained imprisoned in a fortress and was then subjected to an examination by a secret commission. Ultimately he was released by order of Paul I of Russia in 1798. The day of his acquittal and release, 19 Kislev, 5559 on the Hebrew calendar, is celebrated as the "Hasidic New Year" by Lubavitch Hasidim, who have a festive meal and communal pledges to learn the whole of the Talmud known as "Chalukat Ha'Shas." Two years later he was again imprisoned based on false denunciation. He was released immediately after the accession of Alexander I of Russia, and he was then  given full liberty to proclaim his religious teachings  by the Russian government.

It was after this that he moved his base to Liadi, Imperial Russia: rather than returning to Liozna, he took up his residence in the town of Liadi at the invitation of Prince Stanis aw Lubomirski, Voivod of the town. In Liadi, his movement grew immensely - and he is still associated with Liadi to this day. Rabbi Shneur Zalman has since been accepted as one of the greatest Hasidic leaders inasmuch as the books that he authored studied and respected by all Hasidic groups.  In 1812, fleeing the French Invasion, he left Mogilev, intending to go to Poltava, but died on the way in the small village of Pyen, near Kursk.

He was succeeded as Rebbe by his oldest son, Dovber.  According to David Assaf, his youngest son, Moshe, converted to Catholicism, however this is disputed  

Philosophy.
See Hasidic philosophy;

As a Talmudist, Rabbi Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In his seminal work, Tanya, he defines his approach as "               " ("mind ruling over the heart/emotions"). He chose the name Chabad for this philosophy - the Hebrew acronym for the Sefirot  Chochma ("wisdom"),  Bina ("understanding"), and  Da'at ("knowledge ). 

Both in his works and in his sermons he  indicated an intelligent and not a blind faith , and assumed an intellectual accessibility of the mystical teachings of the Kabbalah. This intellectual basis differentiates Chabad from other forms of Hasidism. Chabad refers to these as "Chagat"   being the emotional attributes (Sefirot) of  Chesed ("kindness"),  Gevurah ("power"), and  Tifereth ("beauty").

Subsequent history of Chabad.
See Chabad-Lubavitch: History of the movement;
 
After he passed away, his son and successor, Rabbi Dovber Schneuri, moved the movement to the town of Lubavitch (Lyubavichi) in present-day Belarus. In 1940, under the leadership of the previous Rebbe, Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn, the Chabad Lubavitch movement moved its headquarters to Brooklyn, New York in the United States.  Under the leadership of, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Chabad established branches all over the world staffed by its own Lubavitch-trained, and ordained, rabbis with their wives and children. 

Another follower of his, Rabbi Aharon HaLevi Horowitz, established a rival Chabad school in Strashelye

Descendants of Rabbi Shneur Zalman adopted the names Schneersohn or Schneerson to accommodate Napoleonic edicts that required all subjects to take permanent surnames. (Prior to Napoleon's conquests and the winds of Enlightenment he brought in his wake, Jews only had their traditional names such as Shneur ben (son of) Boruch.) The last two Rebbes of Chabad Lubavitch, Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn (1880-1950) and Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson  (1902-1994), adhered strictly to their family surnames.

Works.
Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi was a prolific writer; but only a few of his works have been published. He produced works of both mysticism and law, reflecting his intellectual stance on Hasidism; to this day his works form the cornerstone of Chabad-Lubavitch. His ability to explain even the most complex issues of Torah made his writings popular with Torah scholars everywhere. 

He is probably best known for his systematic exposition of Hasidic Jewish philosophy, entitled Likkutei Amarim, and more popularly known as the Tanya, first published in 1797. (The fuller and more authoritative version of this work dates from 1814.) Due to the popularity of this book, Hasidic Jews often refer to Shneur Zalman as the Baal HaTanya. The Tanya deals with Jewish spirituality and psychology, from a Kabbalistic point of view, and expounds on such profound themes as the Oneness of God, Tzimtzum, the Sefirot, and many other mystical concepts. 

He is equally well known for the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, his version of the classic Shulkhan Arukh, an authoritative code of Jewish law and custom commissioned by Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch. The work states the decided halakha, as well as the underlying reasoning. The Shulchan Aruch HaRav is considered authoritative by other Hasidim, and citations to this work are many times found in non-Hasidic sources such as the Mishnah Berurah used by Lithuanian Jews and the Ben Ish Chai used by Sephardic Jews. Rabbi Shneur Zalman is one of three authorities on whom Shlomo Ganzfried based his Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh.

He also edited the first Chabad siddur - Siddur Torah Or. It was based on the Ari Siddur of the famous kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria (Arizal) of Safed - altered for general use, and correcting textual errors. Today's Siddur Tehillat HaShem is based on Shneur Zalman's Siddur Torah Or.

Rabbi Shneur Zalman's other works include:
Torah Or and Likutei Torah, reflections on the weekly Torah portions, Shir HaShirim, and the Book of Esther - based on the Hasidic Discourses of the Alter Rebbe and published by his grandson, the Tzemach Tzedek.
Hilkot Talmud Torah, on the study of Torah.

Nat Hentoff (born June 10, 1925) is an American historian, jazz critic, and columnist for the Village Voice, Legal Times, Washington Times, The Progressive, Editor & Publisher, Free Inquiry and Jewish World Review.

Hentoff was educated at Boston Latin School, Northeastern University, and Harvard University. Hentoff is known as a civil libertarian, free speech activist and anti-death penalty advocate, but he is often critical of the ideological left. He also supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and he is pro-life on abortion. Hentoff was named as one of six 2004 NEA Jazz Masters, the first non-musician to win this award.

In recent years, Nat Hentoff has become a vocal critic of the American Civil Liberties Union (an organization he once supported) for its advocacy of government-enforced campus and workplace speech codes and its support of affirmative action, which he considers to be state-sponsored racial and ethnic discrimination. He now serves on the board of advisors for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, another civil liberties group. Hentoff's book, Free Speech for Me   But Not for Thee, outlines his views on free speech and excoriates those who he feels favor censorship in any form.

Hentoff is critical of Bush Administration policies such as the Patriot Act and other civil liberties implications of the recent push for "homeland security." He was also strongly critical of Clinton Administration policies such as the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.

In February 2003, Hentoff signed a letter circulated by Social Democrats, USA advocating the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq on human rights grounds, citing reports detailing Hussein's disregard for fundamental liberties. In March and April of that year Hussein was deposed by a US-led invasion, launching the ongoing Iraq war. In summer 2003, Hentoff wrote a column for the Washington Times in which he supported Tony Blair's humanitarian justifications for the war. He also criticized the Democratic Party for casting doubt on President Bush's pre-war assertions about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction in an election year.

Despite what are generally considered liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, Hentoff developed views opposed to abortion, voluntary euthanasia and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants in the 1980s. Hentoff declared that his views had nothing to do with his Jewish faith. Hentoff said that shortly after he "came out" as an opponent of abortion, several of his colleagues at The Village Voice stopped speaking to him. In October 2005, Hentoff was honored by the Human Life Foundation at the Third Annual Great Defender of Life dinner.

Dr. Stewart Lynn "Stu" Blusson OC (born 1939) is a multimillionaire and philanthropist. He co-discovered billion-dollar Ekati Diamond Mine, 300 kilometres from Yellowknife, Canada. He is President of Archon Minerals Ltd. Blusson donated $10 million for the Archon X Prize to develop a quick and inexpensive way to sequence the human genome. 

 Biography .
Blusson was born in Vancouver, BC in 1939. He completed an undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia (1960) and a doctorate in geology at the University of California, Berkeley (1964). 

After school, he joined the federal Geological Survey of Canada, leading regional geological mapping and research programs in the central Yukon and parts of British Columbia. During that time he survived a serious helicopter crash and a Grizzly bear attack. In 1969, Chuck Fipke, a geologist, needed to be rescued from the side of a mountain where he had been stranded for close to a week. Blusson was the helicopter pilot that saved him. From this first encounter, Fipke and Blusson became friends and prospecting partners. In 1980, Blusson married his wife, Marilyn. 

He left the Geological Survey in 1979 to explore the modes of formation of mineral deposits from Mexico to the Arctic. He discovered a number of important occurrences of gold, copper and other metals. 
In 1981, he and Fipke began searching for diamonds in the Northwest Territories, concentrating their search on indicator minerals commonly associated with kimberlite, a host rock for diamond. They found kimberlitic indicator minerals near Lac de Gras in the Northwest Territories in 1985, and their first kimberlite at Pointe Lake in 1991. 

In 1998, Ekati opened, a joint venture between BHP Diamonds Inc. (51%), Dia Met Minerals (29%), Fipke (10%), and Blusson (10%). Blusson's net worth in 2002 was estimated to be $295 million (US). 

In 2004, he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada and was presented with the Logan Medal, Geological Association of Canada's highest honour. 

 Archon X Prize .
In 2006, Blusson donated the largest medical prize in history, $10 million (US), for the Archon X Prize. The prize is named after the ancient Archean Craton core plate beneath Canada where diamonds were discovered. The prize will go to the person or group that can develop a quick (100 people in 10 days) and inexpensive way to sequence a human genome. 

 Philanthropy .

The Hon Michael Lavarch was the federal Attorney-General of Australia between 1993 and 1996.

Micheal is married to Linda Lavarch and the couple have two children.

He commenced his legal career in Brisbane as a Solicitor.

On July 11, 1987 he was elected to Australian Federal Parliament for the Queensland electorate of Fisher.

A Courier Mail article, "Labor's foot soldier" written by Hedley Thomas on 4 November 2000, alleged the 1987 electoral victory in Fisher had been achieved fraudulently, but that Lavarch himself had no knowledge of the underhand tactics employed.

During his political career he was particularly interested in human rights and native title issues. He was responsible for instigating the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families in 1995, culminating in the publication of the Bringing Them Home Report.

In 1998 he was elected as a Queensland delegate to The National Constitutional Convention.

He was Secretary-General of the Law Council of Australia from 2001 to 2004.

In 2004 he was appointed Dean and Professor of Law at Queensland University of Technology, of which he is also a graduate.

History.
Since opening Fat Beats in 1994, the stated mission of the company was to be the "last stop for hip hop" and that remains to be true today.
 
What does "the last stop" mean, exactly? Why the last instead of the first stop? That is a question we hear often. Let us explain how we see it. Fat Beats is the last stop for hip hop because our goal is to be the place that hip hop is safe to express itself in all its forms as it would as if it had a home, as you are similarly safe when you reach your "last stop" each day after you've done what you needed to do to feed your family, after you've navigated the socio-political minefield of the real world, after you've had to fight and scratch and claw for your respect from people who don't know you, who don't love you, and who don't understand you. At Fat Beats, we feel that hip hop needs a place like that.
 
Fat Beats is the last stop for hip hop - where the dj, where the b-boy, where the graf writer, where the emcee can come and feel secure that they are among family who love and support the hip hop culture as much as they do. At Fat Beats Records, it isn't about being old or new school and it isn't about being a backpacker or a thug. We're down with and support hip hop legends like DITC's Lord Finesse or EDO.G. & Pete Rock as strongly as we are down with and support the creative expression of today's hip hop explorers such as Atmosphere, J-Zone, J-Live, and Soul Position. 2006 looks to be a banner year for Fat Beats Records with a heavyweight roster including Count Bass D, Akrobatik, Glue, Louis Logic, Ugly Duckling and El Da Sensei. Also look for the debut album from newcomers Pseudo Slang and the sophomore effort from One Be Lo.
 
Fat Beats Records, the last stop for hip hop, is open. We hope we're successful in helping keep alive an avenue of expression for the artists and culture that we've loved since day one.

Beinn an Dothaidh  (Scottish Gaelic:  'hill of the scorching or singeing'), is a mountain located in the Bridge of Orchy hills of Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is located beside the more popular Beinn Dorain. The two hills are frequently climbed together from the bealach between them, which is easily accessed from the Bridge of Orchy railway station.

Alternatively, Beinn an Dothaidh may be climbed via its northwest ridge, or combined with an ascent of Beinn Achaladair to the northeast.

<doc id="5938454" title="Leaping Michaels" nonfiltered="1031" processed="1017" dbindex="1481041">

 
In the game of bridge, Leaping Michaels is a conventional overcall made in defense to an opposing 2-level or 3-level preempt. Leaping Michaels is played by many pairs as it provides a means to show strong two-suited hands (5-5 or longer) that are less suitable for a takeout double.
 
To do so, Leaping Michaels, utilises the 4 and 4 bids. Similar to Michaels cuebid, in case this minor suit overcall is in the opposing suit, both major suits are implied. In case the overcall is not a cuebid, the suit bid plus a major suit is indicated. So, on preempts of the opponents (indicated between brackets), the following applies when playing Leaping Michaels: 

(2/3) - 4 : Clubs and spades;
(2/3) - 4 : Diamonds and spades;
(2/3) - 4 : Clubs and hearts;
(2/3) - 4 : Diamonds and hearts;
(3) - 4 : Majors;
(3) - 4 : Diamonds and an undisclosed major;
(3) - 4 : Clubs and an undisclosed major;
(3) - 4 : Majors ;

After (3) - 4, a bid of 4 asks for the major. The bids 4 and 4 are to play.
 
Following (3) - 4 the bid of 4 is played as pass-or-correct.

Some partnerships prefer to interchange the meanings of the 4 and 4 bids following a 3 preempt so that 4 denotes diamonds and an undisclosed major. This has the advantage that the 4 becomes available to ask for the major suit. The 4/4 responses can then be played as natural (to play).

Leaping Michaels can be utilised after natural two-level preempts, but also after conventional preempts such as Muiderberg. Even after a Multi 2 diamonds preempt, Leaping Michaels can be utilised to good effect:

(2) - 4 : Clubs and an undisclosed major (4 asks for the major);
(2) - 4 : Diamonds and an undisclosed major (4 is pass-or-correct);

Frankford Township is a township in Mower County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 358 at the 2000 census.  The largest town located partially within the township is Grand Meadow with a population of 945 people.  The eastern half of Grand Meadow is in Frankford Township and the western half is in Grand Meadow Township.  All other areas of the township are unincorporated.  There was a village called Frankford on Deer Creek in the far eastern part of the township near Fillmore County.  It almost became the county seat but lost this distinction to Austin.  
Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 77.7 km² (30.0 mi²).  77.6 km² (30.0 mi²) of it is land and 0.03% is water.
Demographics.
As of the census2 of 2000, there were 358 people, 125 households, and 101 families residing in the township.  The population density was 4.6/km² (11.9/mi²).  There were 131 housing units at an average density of 1.7/km² (4.4/mi²).  The racial makeup of the township was 100.00% White. 
There were 125 households out of which 38.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 76.0% were married couples living together, 4.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.4% were non-families. 16.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 5.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.86 and the average family size was 3.24.
In the township the population was spread out with 28.2% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 26.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.9% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 114.4 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.7 males.
The median income for a household in the township was $56,250, and the median income for a family was $61,250. Males had a median income of $31,641 versus $31,771 for females. The per capita income for the township was $21,845.  About 4.0% of families and 5.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.4% of those under age 18 and 11.9% of those age 65 or over.
Frankford Village, the old county seat.
The village was settled along the banks of Deer Creek in 1854 by Lewis Patchin, Bartlett Leathers, and Byron Woodworth.  The town was  in 1856 and it was declared the county seat.  At one time is was a bustling frontier village that had three stores, a schoolhouse, a cemetery, three blacksmith and wagon shops, a grist mill, a chair and coffin factory, a shoe shop and the Patchin Hotel which also served as the post office.  County court was held here and the county's records were stored in an upstairs room of Patchin's Hotel.  After being passed over as the county's seat, its population slowly dwindled.  When the Southern Minnesota Railroad was laid in 1870 it ran four miles south of the village and this development is what ultimately spelled doom for the once-thriving community.  Rather than move the city to the railroad as the citizens of Le Roy did, the citizens simply relocate to other parts of the township and county.  All that is left of the old village is a cemetery, which is still used, that can be found in the northeast quadrant of section 24 of Frankford Township.

Showdown at Patchin's Inn.
Cemeteries.
Frankford Cemetery is located in the northeast quadrant of section 24 of the township.  It is directly south of the Old Frankford Village.
Bear Creek Cemetery is located in the southeast quadrant of section 7 of the township.  Its oldest known burial dates to 1872. ;
Methodist Norwegian Cemetery is a deserted cemetery located in the southeast quadrant of section 7 of the township.  Its last burial dates to 1940. ;
Sever Temanson Cemetery is located in the southwest corner of the northwest quadrant of section 8 of the township.  It is now not used, but it was used for burials between 1854 and 1870.

History.


Kill Devil Hills is the site of the Wright Brothers National Memorial, comemorating Orville Wright's historic first flight in a machine powered heavier than air vehicle. This historic event occurred on Thursday, December 17, 1903. The Wrights returned in 1911, and on October 25, Orville  Wright reached an elevation of 225 feet and remained in the air 10 minutes and 34 seconds in a glider, setting a new world record. 

Perhaps one of the most popular questions in reference to Kill Devil Hills is the origin of the name. Kill Devil Hills, like many of the other local towns, received its name due to the pirates who once called these shores home. One night while taking shore leave various pirates were sitting in the hills of the area (in reality sand dunes) and drinking moonshine that they said was "strong enough to kill the devil."

This story sounds suspiciously like folklore, yet is entirely true.

Popular culture.
The 2005 solo album, Tyranny of Souls by Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson features a track named Kill Devil Hill.  The song is a reference to the discovery made by the Wright Brothers.

Kill Devil Hills is listed as the home of Dennis Anderson and the popular Grave Digger monster truck team.

In computing, the X Window System (commonly X11 or X) is a network-transparent windowing system for bitmap displays. This article details the protocols and technical structure of X11.

The X client-server model and network transparency.

X is based on a client-server model. An X server program runs on a computer with a graphical display and communicates with various client programs. The server accepts requests for graphical output (windows) and sends back user input (keyboard, mouse).

In X Window, the server runs on the user's computer, while the clients may run on a different machine. This is the reverse of the common configuration of client-server systems, where the client runs on the user's computer and the server runs on a remote computer. This reversal often confuses new X users. The X Window terminology takes the perspective of the program, rather than the end-user or the hardware: the remote programs connect to the X server display running on the local machine, and thus act as clients; the local X display accepts incoming traffic, and thus acts as a server.


The communication protocol between server and client runs network-transparently: the client and server may run on the same machine or on different ones, possibly with different architectures and operating systems. A client and server can communicate securely over the Internet by tunneling the connection over an encrypted connection.

Design principles.
Bob Scheifler and Jim Gettys set out the early principles of X as follows (as listed in Scheifler/Gettys 1996):

Do not add new functionality unless an implementor cannot complete a real application without it.;
It is as important to decide what a system is not as to decide what it is. Do not serve all the world's needs; rather, make the system extensible so that additional needs can be met in an upwardly compatible fashion.;
The only thing worse than generalizing from one example is generalizing from no examples at all.;
If a problem is not completely understood, it is probably best to provide no solution at all.;
If you can get 90 percent of the desired effect for 10 percent of the work, use the simpler solution. (See also Worse is better.);
Isolate complexity as much as possible.;
Provide mechanism rather than policy. In particular, place user interface policy in the clients' hands.;

The first principle was modified during the design of X11 to: "Do not add new functionality unless you know of some real application that will require it." X has largely kept to these principles since. The reference implementation is developed with a view to extension and improvement of the implementation, whilst remaining almost entirely compatible with the original 1987 protocol.

X Window core protocol.


Communication between server and clients is done by exchanging packets over a network channel. The connection is established by the client, which sends the first packet. The server answers by sending back a packet stating the acceptance or refusal of the connection, or with a request for a further authentication. If the connection is accepted, the acceptance packet contains data for the client to use in the subsequent interaction with the server.
 
After connection is established, four types of packets are exchanged by the client and the server over the channel:

Request: The client requests information from the server or requests it to perform an action.
Reply: The server responds to a request. Not all requests generate replies.
Event: The server sends an event to the client, e.g., keyboard or mouse input, or a window being moved, resized or exposed.
Error: The server sends an error packet if a request is invalid. Since requests are queued, error packets generated by a request may not be sent immediately.

The X server provides a set of basic services. The client programs realize more complex functionalities by interacting with the server.

Windows.


What is usually called a window in other graphical user interfaces is a top-level window in the X Window System. The term window is also used for windows that lie within another window, that is, the subwindows of a parent window.  Graphical elements such as buttons, menus, icons, etc. are all realized using windows.
 
A window can only be created as a subwindow of a parent window. This makes the windows to be arranged in a tree, that is, a hierarchy. The root of this hierarchy is called the root window, which is automatically created by the server. The top-level windows are exactly the direct subwindows of the root window. Visibly, the root window is as large as the screen, and lies behind all other windows.

Identifiers.

All data about windows, fonts, etc. is stored in the server. The client knows identifiers of these objects integers it can use as names for them when interacting with the server. For example, if a client wishes a window to be created, it requests the server to create a window with a given identifier. The server creates a window and associates it with the identifier. The identifier can be later used by the client to request, for example, a string to be drawn in the window.
 
Identifiers are unique to the server, not only to the client; for example, no two windows have the same identifier, even if created by two different clients. A client can access any object given its identifier, even if the object has been created by another client.

Attributes and properties.

Every window has a predefined set of attributes and a set of properties, all stored in the server and accessible to the clients via appropriate requests. Attributes are data about the window, such as its size, position, background color, etc. Properties are pieces of data that are attached to a window. Contrary to attributes, properties have no meaning at the level of the X Window core protocol. A client can store arbitrary data in a property of a window.

A property is characterized by a name, a type, and a value. Properties are similar to variables in imperative programming languages, in that the application can create a new property with a given name and of a given type and store a value in it. Properties are associated to windows: two properties with the same name can exist on two different windows while having different types and values.
 
Properties are mostly used for inter-client communication. For example, the property named WM_NAME is used for storing the name for the window; window managers typically read this property and display the name of the window at the top of it.

The properties of a window can be shown using the xprop program. In particular, xprop -root shows the properties of the root window, which include the X resources (parameters of programs).

Events.

Events are packets sent by the server to the client to communicate that something the client may be interested in has happened. A client can request the server to send an event to another client; this is used for communication between clients. For example, when a client requests the text that is currently selected, an event is sent to the client that is currently handling the window that holds the selection.

The content of a window may be destroyed in some conditions (for example, if the window is covered). Whenever an area of destroyed content is made visible, the server generates an Expose event to notify the client that a part of the window has to be drawn.
 
Other events are used to notify clients of keyboard or mouse input, of the creation of new windows, etc.

Some kinds of events are always sent to client, but most kinds of event are sent only if the client previously stated an interest in them. This is because clients may only be interested in some kind of events. For example, a client may be interested in keyboard-related event but not in mouse-related events.

Color modes.
The way colors are handled in the X Window Systems sometimes confuse users, and historically several different modes has been supported. Most modern applications use TrueColor (24-bit color, 8 bits for each of red, green and blue), but old or specialist applications may require a different color mode. Many commercial specialist applications use PseudoColor.

The X11 protocol actually uses a single 32-bit unsigned integer for representing a single color in most graphic operations, called a pixelvalue. When transferring primary colors intensity, a 16 bits integer is used for each colour component. The following representations of colors exist; not all of them may be supported on a specific device.

DirectColor: A pixel value is decomposed into separate red, green, and blue subfields. Each subfield indexes a separate colormap. Entries in all colormaps can be changed.
TrueColor: Same as DirectColor, except that the colormap entries are predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed. Typically, each of the red, green, and blue colormaps provides a (near) linear ramp of intensity.
GrayScale: A pixel value indexes a single colormap that contains monochrome intensities. Colormap entries can be changed.
StaticGray: Same as GrayScale, except that the colormap entries are predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed.
PseudoColor (Chunky): A pixel value indexes a single colormap that contains color intensities. Colormap entries can be changed.
StaticColor: Same as PseudoColor, except that the colormap entries are predefined by the hardware and cannot be changed.


Xlib and other client libraries.


Most client programs communicate with the server via the Xlib client library. In particular, most clients use libraries such as Xaw, Motif, GTK+, or Qt which in turn use Xlib for interacting with the server.

Inter-client communication.

The X Window core protocol provides mechanisms for communication between clients: window properties and events, in particular the client-to-client message events. However, it does not specify any protocol for such interactions. These protocols are instead governed by a separate set of inter-client communication conventions.

The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual specifies the protocol for the exchange of data via selections and the interaction of applications with the window manager. This specification has been considered difficult and confusing; consistency of application look and feel and communication is typically addressed by programming to a given desktop environment. 

The Inter-Client Exchange protocol (ICE) specifies a framework for building protocols for interaction between clients, so that a specific protocol can be built at the top of it. In particular, the X Session Management protocol (XSMP) is a protocol based on ICE that mandates over the interaction between applications with the session manager, which is the program that takes care of storing the status of the desktop at the end of an interactive session and recovering it when another session with the same user is started again.

Newer conventions are included in the freedesktop specifications, including the drag-and-drop convention Xdnd used for transferring data by selecting it and dragging in another window and the embedded application convention Xembed which details how an application can  be run in a subwindow of another application.

Selections, cut buffers, and drag-and-drop.


Selections, cut buffers, and drag-and-drop are the mechanisms used in the X Window System to allow a user to transfer data from a window to another. Selections and cut buffer are used (typically) when a user selects text or some other data in a window and paste in another one. Drag-and-drop is used when a user selects something in a window, then clicks on the selection and drags it into another window.

Since the two windows may be handled by two different applications, data transfer requires two different clients connected with the same X server to interact. The X Window core protocol includes some types of requests and events that are specific to selection exchange, but the transfer is mainly done using the general client-to-client event sending and window properties, which are not specific to selection transfer.

Data to be transferred between clients can be of different types: it is usually text, but can also be a pixmap, a number, a list of objects, etc.

Selections and drag-and-drop are active mechanisms: after some text has been selected in a window, the client handling the window must actively support a protocol for transferring the data to the application requesting it. On the contrary, cut buffers are a passive mechanism: when the user selects some text, its content is transferred to a cut buffer, where it remains even if the application handling the window terminates and the window is destroyed.

Window manager.


A window manager is a program that controls the general appearance of windows and other graphical elements of the graphical user interface. Differences in the look of X Window System in different installations is mainly due to the use of different window managers or different configurations of the window manager.

The window manager takes care of deciding the position of windows, placing the decorative border around them, handling icons, handling mouse clicks outside windows (on the  background ), handling certain keystrokes (for example, iconifying a window when ALT-F4 is pressed), etc.



From the point of view of the X server, the window manager is not different from the other clients. The initial position and the decorative borders around windows are handled by the window manager using the following requests:

 an application can request the server not to satisfy requests of mapping (showing) subwindows of a given window, and to be sent an event instead;
 an application can request changing the parent of a window.

The window manager uses the first request to intercept any request for mapping top-level windows (children of the root window). Whenever another application requests the mapping of a top-level window, the server does not do it but sends an event to the window manager instead. Most window managers reparents the window: they create a larger top-level window (called the frame window) and reparent the original window as a child of it. Graphically, this corresponds to placing the original window inside the frame window. The space of the frame window that is not taken by the original window is used for the decorative frame around the window (the  border  and the  title bar ).

The window manager manages mouse clicks in the frame window. This allows for example to move or resize the window when the user clicks and drags on the border or on the title bar.

The window manager is also responsible for the handling of icons and related visual elements of the graphical user interface. Icons do not exist at the level of the X Window core protocol. They are implemented by the window manager. For example, whenever a window has to be  iconified , the window manager FVWM unmaps the window, making it not visible, and creates a window for the icon name and possibly another window for the icon image. The meaning and handling of icons is therefore completely decided by the window manager: some window managers such as wm2 do not implement icons at all.

Session manager.

 
Roughly, the state of a session is the  state of the desktop  at a given time: a set of windows with their current content. More precisely, it is the set of applications managing these windows and the information that allow these applications to restore the condition of their managed windows if required. An X session manager is a program that saves and restore the state of sessions.
 
The most recognizable effect of using a session manager is the possibility of logging out from an interactive session and then finding exactly the same windows in the same state when logging in again. For this to work, the session manager program stores the names of the running applications at logout and starts them again at login. In order for the state of the applications to be restored as well (which is needed to restore the content of windows), the applications must be able to save their state of execution upon request from the session manager and load it back when they start again.

The X Window System include a default session manager called xsm. Other session managers have been developed for specific desktop systems: for example, ksmserver is the default session manager of KDE.

X display manager.


The X display manager is the program that shows the graphical login prompt in the X Window System. More generally, a display manager runs one or more X servers on the local computer and accepts incoming connections from X servers running on remote computers. The local servers are started by the display manager, which then connects to them to present the user the login screen. The remote servers are started independently from the display manager and connect to it. In this situation, the display manager works like a graphical telnet server: an X server can connect to the display manager, which starts a session; the programs of this sessions run on the same computer of the display manager but have input and output on the computer where the X server runs (which is the computer in front of the user).
 
XDM is the basic display manager supplied with the X Window System. Other display manager include GDM (GNOME), KDM (KDE), WDM (using the WINGs widget set used in Window Maker) and entrance (using the architecture used in Enlightenment v.17).

User interface elements.

Early widget toolkits for X included Xaw (the Athena Widget Set), OLIT (OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit), XView, Motif and Tk. OLIT and XView function as the base toolkits for AT&T and Sun's OPEN LOOK GUI.

Motif provides the base toolkit for the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), which is the standard desktop environment used on commercial Unix systems such as Solaris and HP-UX. (GNOME is offered in Solaris 9 and will be standard in future versions.)

More modern toolkits include Qt (used by KDE), GTK+ (used by GNOME), wxWidgets, FLTK and FOX.

Extensions.

The X server was designed to be simple but extensible. As such, much functionality now resides in extensions to the protocol.

At the protocol level, every extension can be assigned new request/event/error packet types. Access to client applications to the functionalities provided by extensions is facilitated by client libraries. The coding of extensions into the current X server implementations is reportedly difficult due to a lack of modularity in the server design. It is a long term goal of the XCB project to automate generating both the client and server sides of extensions from XML protocol descriptions.

The following is a partial list of extensions that have been developed, sorted roughly by recency of introduction:

The aire urbaine (not to be confused with English "urban area") is an INSEE (the national statistics office of France) statistical region comprising a couronne périurbaine commuter belt around a contiguous pôle urbain (Urban area) urban core. 

Although it can be roughly compared to the North American "Metropolitan Area" in concept, it is quite different in calculation: whereas the former is generally an extension of the limit of urban area growth to the borders of the county containing it, the aire urbaine is a unit the result of a quite literal methodology: 

Drawn upon France's nation-wide map of interlocking commune municipalities, the aire urbaine has for its centre a pôle urbain (similar to a unité urbaine (or "urban area") - see note below) core of communes containing an interconnecting and unbroken urban growth; this centre forms a "pole of attraction" for a couronne périurbaine (commuter belt) ring of communes having at least 40% of their resident populations commuting with the pôle urbain, or with other communes having the same relation to the pôle urbain. The result is a precise demographic map of a) a centre of urban growth and b) its socio-economic reach into the surrounding area.

Note: There is a slight difference between a unité urbaine and a pôle urbain : the basic unité urbaine is a contiguous urban growth containing at least 5,000 jobs, and the pôle urbain is the same as a centre of demographic growth; that is to say it is an urban area that it is not contained within the couronne périurbaine (commuter belt) of any other pôle urbain.

Here is a list of the fifteen largest aires urbaines of France based on population at the 1999 census:

<doc id="2894234" title="Momo Hinamori" nonfiltered="1041" processed="1027" dbindex="1481051">

 is a character from the manga and anime series Bleach. She is the lieutenant of the 5th Division of the Gotei 13, formerly under S suke Aizen.



 Character outline .
Hinamori is an upbeat and easygoing girl who gets along with nearly everyone she meets. Hinamori is generally quite trusting, but also very impulsive and naïve. She greatly admires her former captain, S suke Aizen, and is a childhood friend of the 10th Division captain, T shir  Hitsugaya. Her appearance is fairly ordinary compared to other shinigami in Soul Society. She wears her hair up in a bun with a cloth wrapped around it. According to Tite Kubo, Hinamori's name was changed at the last minute; she had a completely different name in the sketch stage.

 History .

Hinamori grew up in Junrinan, District 1 of Rukongai, along with T shir  Hitsugaya. While Hitsugaya tended to be a bit of a brat as a child and insisted that he would protect her, Hinamori found him amusing and treated him in an older sisterly fashion. The two became close friends and remain so, evident by Hinamori's continued tendency to use her nickname for him, Shir -chan (literally "Whitey," in reference to his hair), while Hitsugaya grew out of calling her "bed-wetter Momo". 

When Hinamori entered the shinigami academy, she excelled at demon arts. It was there that she met Izuru Kira and Renji Abarai, who soon became her friends and, later, her fellow lieutenants. Once, when she was training, a captain was evaluating the academy and it was S suke Aizen, whom she became enamored with. Later, the 5th division saved Momo, Izuru Kira and Renji Abarai, from some hollows. They were placed in the 5th Division of the Gotei 13 under Captain Aizen and his lieutenant, Gin Ichimaru. Hinamori remained in the 5th Division and became the division's lieutenant (through much hard work, as noted by Hitsugaya) while Kira later moved to the 3rd Division as Gin Ichimaru's lieutenant. Renji was moved to 11th Division and later made lieutenant of the 6th Division, under Byakuya Kuchiki.

 Synopsis .
 Soul Society arc .
Hinamori's trusting nature and impulsive tendencies, as well as her devotion to her captain, turns her into an unwitting puppet during the Soul Society arc. As the issue of Rukia Kuchiki's execution comes up, Hitsugaya warns her to be wary of Gin Ichimaru and the 3rd Division.

Aizen's supposed death drives Hinamori to challenge Ichimaru to avenge Aizen's death. As she is too upset to listen to reason, Kira, out of loyalty for his captain, steps in and fights her instead. Hitsugaya interrupts their fight, arresting both of them. In jail, Hinamori receives a letter written by Aizen citing that Hitsugaya was his murderer. Escaping jail, she interrupts a confrontation between Ichimaru and Hitsugaya, but is knocked unconscious by Hitsugaya, who did not wish to fight her and was concerned for her safety.

She is later taken to the 10th Division headquarters by Hitsugaya and his lieutenant, Rangiku Matsumoto. Hitsugaya erectes a barrier around her room designed to keep others out, but it is not designed to keep her in. Thus, with her skill in demon arts, escaping is an easy task for her. She follows Hitsugaya, whom she still believes to be Aizen's killer, to the Chamber of 46. Ichimaru is waiting for her and takes her to see Aizen, who had in fact faked his death. At this point, her relief is so great that the nearby dead bodies and the letter he had given her earlier don't so much as cross her mind. While embracing Hinamori, Aizen stabs her.

When Hitsugaya arrives after the fact and asks Aizen why he killed her, Aizen merely comments that "admiration is the emotion furthest from comprehension." Later on, Aizen explains that he had manipulated her to be completely dependent on him, thus killing her was an act of kindness. Hitsugaya attempts to kill him, but is nearly killed himself instead. Both Hinamori and Hitsugaya are then saved by Unohana, who arrives shortly after Hitsugaya's defeat to confront Aizen.

 Arrancar arc .
Hinamori remains unconscious well beyond the Soul Society arc, awakening shortly before Hitsugaya departs to the living world to help Ichigo with the arrancar. When she awakens, she still seems to be under the thrall of Aizen, blaming Ichimaru for his actions. Whether or not she's still under Aizen's power remains to be seen, though her denial of the facts seems to be a coping mechanism, something that greatly disturbs and angers Hitsugaya.

 Tobiume .

Hinamori's zanpakut  is Tobiume (  , lit. flying ume tree). The command for its initial release is .

When its initial release is activated, Tobiume's blade straightens and produces several, jitte-like prongs along its length. In this form, Tobiume acts as a focus for Hinamori's spiritual power, concentrating it into pink-colored energy bursts capable of cratering floors and breaching walls. Hinamori can also compress her power into a single massive energy ball. In the game Bleach: Blade Battlers, Tobiume creates crimson fire instead of pink-colored energy bursts.

See also the Campaign for Free Education (Ireland).;

The Campaign for Free Education (often abbreviated CFE) was a left-wing grouping in the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom of those opposed to tuition fees and the abolition of student grants.

The coalition was founded in 1995 in opposition to proposals by Labour Students and the Organised Independents for the NUS to abandon its opposition to the abolition of student grants. Although initially a broad based campaign encompassing many from across the spectrum the organisation moved towards a stronger left-wing position, pushed by student members of the Alliance for Workers Liberty who had been amongst the founders. The CFE maintained a continuous presence of NUS executive members, being particularly strong in the LGB and Women's Campaigns. They saw successive NUS Conferences pass policy in line with their positions on opposing tuition fees and top-up fees, but continued to complain that the NUS National Executive Committee did not actively fight for this. The CFE often stood candidates for the major NEC positions in a coalition slate with various groups including the Student Broad Left, the Socialist Workers' Students' Society and the National Black Students' Alliance but generally won only one position out of six at most in successive years. Several of the successful candidates, whether from the CFE or other groups, subsequently publicly fell out with their original supporters, weakening the organisation.

In 2004, Kat Fletcher, standing for the CFE, was elected as the first non-Labour Students backed NUS President in twenty years. However, she left the group shortly afterwards and moved towards the right wing of the organisation. The CFE gradually declined until its remaining activists took part in the founding of a new, wider Education Not for Sale network.

The Chinese Elm U. parvifolia cultivar Zettler (Heritage )   is one of three recent (< 2006) American introductions selected for their cold hardiness (USA zone 4 tolerant). The tree has a strong, upright habit and excellent branching structure, bearing deep green glossy foliage that turns to an attractive autumn colour in some years. Heritage  was originally selected from over 20,000 seedlings in 1975, and subsequently proved to be one of the hardiest Chinese or Lacebark Elms available in the USA, surviving -28° F (-33° C) in Illinois during the winter of 1989 without sustaining any damage whatsoever.

In the elections to the Austrian National Council of 1959, the SPÖ leaped ahead of the ÖVP in votes, but trailed behind it by one seat. The KPÖ lost all its seats in parliament in has remained an extra-parliamentary party since then.

The coalition between the ÖVP (led by Julius Raab) and the SPÖ (led by Bruno Pittermann) was continued. The SPÖ's strong showing allowed it to demand more important posts in the government, which is why Leopold Figl retired from federal politics to be succeeded as foreign minister by Bruno Kreisky.

A Boiler Room Brawl is a professional wrestling match type. It is known as being one of the signature matches of Mick Foley. The first Boiler Room Brawl occurred at SummerSlam 1996 and was held between Foley (using his Mankind persona) and The Undertaker. The rules of this particular match stated that the match would begin in the boiler room of the arena and the first competitor to make their way to the ring and take possession of an urn, which was being held by The Undertaker's then-manager Paul Bearer, would win the match. However, in future Boiler Room Brawl matches, the first person to exit the room was declared the winner.

Matches of this type were:
SummerSlam 1996 - Mankind def. The Undertaker;
Backlash 1999 - Mankind   def. The Big Show;
September 23, 1999 episode of SmackDown! - Triple H def Mankind ;
December 20, 1999 episode of RAW is WAR - 'Santa Clauses' def. Mankind ;

Thalia, or Thaleia (      ,  blooming ), can refer to three distinct entities in Greek mythology.

The Muse.

Thalia was a rustic goddess, the Muse of comedy and idyllic poetry. In this context, her name means  flourishing,  because the praises in her songs flourish through time.

The name Thalia takes its root in the Albanian language. Tallia means "mockery" in Albanian, explaining the role of Thalia, which is the Muse of comedy.

Thalia was the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the eighth-born of the nine Muses. Her children by Apollo were the Corybantes.

In art, Thalia was portrayed holding a comic mask, a shepherd s staff, or a wreath of ivy.

Member of the Three Graces.
The Grace Thalia was the goddess of banquets and other festivities. In this context, her name means "rich" or "abundant".

Thalia s father was Zeus; her mother was either Eurynome or Eunomia.

Thalia was described as fair-cheeked and beautiful. 

Other mythological figures.
Thalia can also refer to one of Hephaestus  daughters, the nymph of Mount Etna in Sicily. After becoming impregnated by Zeus, she hid beneath the earth due to her fear of Hera. She bore twin sons, the Palici.

A wildlife corridor is the joining of fragmented habitats. This helps to increase the gene flows between the individual habitats which improves the fitness of species. Wildlife corridors are created as a means of conservation or general improvement of the environment.

Wildlife corridors are susceptible to the edge effect, that is that certain species do not prosper near the edges of an ecosystem. Wildlife corridors sometimes cause controversy if they affect or inconvienence the human population.

<doc id="191336" title="Virtual economy" nonfiltered="1052" processed="1038" dbindex="1481062">

A virtual economy (or sometimes synthetic economy) is an emergent economy existing in a virtual persistent world, usually in the context of an Internet game. People enter these virtual economies recreationally rather than by necessity; however, some people do interact with them for "real" economic benefit.

Overview.

These economies are observed in MUDs and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). The largest virtual economies are currently found in MMORPGs, such as Entropia Universe, EverQuest, Ultima Online, Dark Age of Camelot, World of Warcraft, Lineage, Industryplayer, Miniconomy, RuneScape, and EVE Online. Virtual economies also exist in life simulation games such as The Sims Online, or Second Life, which has perhaps taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world, such as recognizing IP rights for assets created "in-world" by Second Life subscribers, and maintaining a laissez faire policy on the buying and selling of Linden Dollars (the world's official currency) for real money on 3rd party websites. They can even exist in browser-based internet games like Neopets, Tokenzone or Kingdom of Loathing where "real" money can be spent and user-created shops opened, or in other games as a kind of Emergent gameplay

 Persistence ­ The software maintains a record of the state of the world and the resource possessions of the players, regardless of whether or not the game is "in session" for any user.
 Scarcity ­ Users must expend "real" resources such as time and money to obtain goods and/or services in the synthetic world.
 Specialization ­ Availability to players of the resources must vary. For example, a participant whose character has metalsmithing skills could have the ability to make swords, while other players would have to purchase them. Because this results in comparative advantage, complex trade relationships and a division of labor result.
 Trade ­ Users must be able to transfer goods and services to and from other users. ;
 Property Rights ­ The world must record which goods and services belong to which user identity, and the code must allow that user to dispose of the good or service according to whim. ;

These conditions of scarcity, specialization, and comparative advantage will create an economic system with properties similar to those seen in contemporary economies. Therefore, economic theory can often be used to study these virtual worlds.

Within the virtual worlds they inhabit, synthetic economies allow in-game items to be priced according to supply and demand rather than by the developer's estimate of the item's utility. These emergent economies are considered by most players to be an asset of the game, giving an extra dimension of reality to play. In classical synthetic economies, these goods were changed only for in-game currencies. These curriencies are often sold for real world profit.

 Controversy: "Real" Economy Interaction .

Often, within a game's synthetic economy, interaction with the "real" economy will occur: characters, spells, and items are sold on online auction websites like eBay for real money. These real economies are controversial, to say the least. For example, most would consider it in poor taste to offer, in a social game, one player real cash in order to play a certain way (for example, the hated "one-real-dollar-for-Boardwalk" player). They are viewed by gamers and game designers as spoilers. However, such rules of etiquette need not apply, and in practice they often don't, to massive game worlds with thousands of players who know one another only through the game system.

While many game developers, such as Blizzard (responsible for World of Warcraft), prohibit the practice, it is common that goods and services within virtual economies will be sold on online auction sites such as eBay, traded for real currencies. Some argue that to allow in-game items to have monetary values makes these games, essentially, gambling venues. 

According to standard conceptions of economic value (see the subjective theory of value), the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value. Since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money (monthly fees) in exchange for these resources, by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user. 

Some virtual world developers officially sell virtual items and currency for real-world money.  For example, the MMOG There has therebucks that sell for US dollars.  The currency in Entropia Universe, Project Entropia Dollars (PED), could be bought and redeemed for real-world money at a rate of 10 PED for U.S.$ 1.  On December 14, 2004, an island in Project Entropia sold for U.S. $26,500 (£13,700).  One gamer also purchased a virtual space station for U.S. $100,000 (£56,200) and plans to use it as a virtual nightclub.  

One of the largest virtual economies, Lineage, is based in South Korea, claiming to have four million users. The location of its online market, if it exists, is unknown.  Many players question the security of such a system due to the possibility of bugs.

Some have claimed that real-economic interactions within virtual economies create a game that constitutes gambling, and that these games should be regulated as such.  Others, such as The Themis Group's Richard Bartle have argued that the notion of virtual property is inherently flawed  since players do not "own", materially or intellectually, any part of the game world, and merely pay to use it. In fact, one of the dangers of investment in virtual property is that the game developer is free to change the game world at any time.

Furthermore, because "virtual property" is actually owned by the game developer, a developer who opposed real commerce of in-game currencies would have the right to destroy virtual goods as soon as they were listed on eBay or otherwise offered for real trade, though this decision would be highly controversial.

A Massive Market Place.

The release of Blizzards' World of Warcraft in 2004 and its subsequent huge success (far surpassing any other MMORPG) across the globe has forced both MMORPGs and their secondary markets into mainstream consciousness.

Many new market places have opened up during this time, a quick search for WoW Gold on Google will show a multitude of sites (90+ sponsored results at this time, June 2006) from which Gold can be purchased - A far cry from the days when players would trade amongst themselves and over eBay. 

 Price Comparison and other Tools .
In such a comparatively competitive market business entrepreneurs have stepped in to help gamers who favour Real Money Trade.  

For example tools for the comparison of this secondary market have recently become more numerous.  
Eye On MOGS (Online since December 2005), was the first site to tackle comparison of Gold sellers. Another notable entry was GamerPrice, the which deployed bots to offer real-time price results. (Online since mid-2006, source NetCraft).

Others include MMOFX, Gold Price Watcher and 
GameUSD.

As MMORPGs continue to grow in popularity and the secondary markets grow with them (some industry experts have suggested that secondary market sales may total more than subscription sales by 2009), services like those above are likely to become less curiosities and more accepted means of interacting with these markets.

Virtual Crime.


The monetary issue can give a virtual world problems similar to the real world. In South Korea, where the number of computer game players is massive, some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia, where powerful players would threaten beginners to give money for their "protection", and actually steal and rob. Other similar problems arise in other virtual economies: in the game The Sims Online a 17-year old boy going by the in-game name "Evangeline", was discovered to have built a cyber-brothel, where customers would pay sim-money for minutes of cybersex. Maxis cancelled each of his accounts, but had he deposited his fortune in the gaming open market he would be able to keep a part of it, as if deposited in a bank. 

Economy stability.

For a persistent world to maintain a stable economy, a balance must be struck between currency sources and sinks. Generally, games possess numerous sources of new currency for players to earn.  However, some possess no effective sinks, or methods of removing currency from circulation.  If other factors remain constant, greater currency supply weakens the buying power of a given amount, a process known as inflation.  In practice, this results in constantly rising prices for traded commodities.  With the proper balance of growth in player base, currency sources, and sinks, a virtual economy could remain stable indefinitely.  

As in the real world, actions by players can de-stabilize the economy. Gold farming creates currency within the game more rapidly than usual, exacerbating inflation. In extreme cases, a hacker may be able to hack into the system and create a large amount of money. This could result in hyperinflation in the game as is the case with Guild Wars.

While the Federal Reserve Bank usually manages to adjust interest rates to slow inflation of the U.S. Dollar, game operators have found this balance very difficult to maintain.  Mudflation is a common problem in virtual economies.

 Capital in Virtual Economies .

In these virtual economies, the value of in-game resources is frequently tied to the in-game power they confer upon the owner. This power allows the user, usually, to acquire more rare and valuable items. In this regard, in-game resources are not just tradable objects but can play the role of capital.

Players also acquire human capital as they become more powerful. Powerful guilds often recruit powerful players so that player can acquire better items which can only be acquired by the cooperation among many players (sometimes to the hundreds). 

Unlike in standard economies, identities, or characters can also be sold. High-level characters can be, in these worlds, the most valuable form of capital. Level 60 EverQuest characters reportedly have sold for as much as $5,000 USD. 

Depending on which industry expert you talk to valuations of the secondary market, i.e. the real money trade of virtual commodities, range from around $1 Billion USD to $3 Billion USD in 2006. In any case this is a very large, and growing, market.

Virtual economies have also been said to exist in the "metagame" worlds of live-action role-playing games and collectible card games.

<doc id="645451" title="Paper candidate" nonfiltered="1053" processed="1039" dbindex="1481063">

In a representative democracy, the term paper candidate is often given to a candidate who stands for a political party in an electoral division where the party in question enjoys little or no support.  Although the candidate himself has little chance of winning, a major party will normally make every reasonable effort to ensure it is on the ballot paper in every constituency.

The term paper candidate is most likely going to be applied if the candidate in question is a party worker from another campaign or the central office, especially if he or she has few connections to the constituency and spends little or no time there. 

An alternate scenario would be where the party is not seriously contesting the election but must run candidates so it can either get registered or stay registered for some other purpose.  An example of this scenario in action is found in Saskatchewan, where the "dormant" Progressive Conservatives continue to run at least 10 candidates in the province's general elections to keep its registration with the Chief Electoral Officer (and to avoid losing control of what is believed to be a substantial amount of money).

An extreme version of a paper candidate, is a "Name on Ballot" or NoB (pronounced knob). Many NoB's will only put up campaign signs, and some do not even do that. In most provinces, the only requirement is that the candidate show up at the returning officer's headquarters for a few moments to take an oath and pay the required nomination deposit. In many smaller parties, such as the Island New Democrats, a majority of the party's candidates in any given election are NoB's. The term is often worn as a badge of pride in one's loyalty to the party. Island New Democrat, Dr. Bob Perry, who has been a NoB many times in the past, often calls himself "Dr. NoB" at election time. In Alberta candidates don't even need to show up to talk to a returning officer, as long as someone on behalf of the party drops off the requisite paperwork and funds.

The Olympus IR-500  is a 4.0-megapixel ultra-compact digital camera introduced by Olympus Corporation in 2004.

It features a 360º swivelling 2.5" LCD display, a 2.8x zoom lens, and 11x digital zoom in an ultra-compact mixed metal and plastic body. The peculiar disposition of the display allows for an enhanced hip-height photo composition (to picture children or low height objects) and auto-portrait mode (allowing the photographer to see the composition).



This camera was meant to be a part of a new digital system by Olympus thought to avoid the use of a personal computer. Named Olympus Easy Imaging System or i:robe, this camera was supplied with a cradle which allows the connection of a 40 GiB hard disk drive (S-HD-100; directly) and a photographic printer (P-S100; through USB). The cradle also allows the typical functions of recharging and connection to a external screen via RCA cable (with sound). The connection to a personal computer is made through an USB cable attached to the cradle. 
Lens.
The lens is an Olympus aspherical glass zoom lens 6.2   17.3mm. The 2.8x zoom is equivalent to 40-112mm in 35mm photography.
Flash.
The camera has a built-in flash.
Movies.
Movies with sound can be recorded, the recording time is dependent on the xD card capacity. They are in Quicktime ( .mov) format. Recording at 320x240 the resultant movie has 30 fps, at any other resolution the framerate drops to 15 fps.
Power Source.
The camera uses a Olympus Li-12B battery.

 School System .
The Plainview- Old Bethpage Central school district contains one high school named Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, two middle schools named Howard B. Mattlin and Plainview Old Bethpage Middle School, and four elementary schools named Parkway (due to its proximity to the Northern State Parkway), Old Bethpage, Pasadena, and Stratford Road.
There is also one Kindergarten Center, a school just for kindergarteners located next to, but connected to Stratford Road Elementary School.  The school district currently has a budget deficit of $1.6 million.

History.
Two schools in Plainview have had the name Manetto Hill Road School. The original building was a one room school house, built in 1899. This building, which still stands, is adjacent to the much larger school of the same name, which was built in the 1950s. Today, both buildings are owned by the Mid-Island Y-JCC. The original building is immediately north of the JCC. The entrance to the building is on the front left side, but if you look closely on the right side opposite the entrance, you'll see the outline of what had been another door. When originally built, the building had separate entrances for boys and girls. The right door, now sealed off, was the girls entrance. The building now serves as  an office for the Nassau-Suffolk Region Bnai Brith Youth Organization.  

The Plainview-Old Bethpage School District was referred to as Central School District #4 until the 1970s. 

Plainview once had two high schools, Plainview-Old Bethpage High School (built 1960) and John F. Kennedy High School (built 1968), the schools were merged in 1992. Plainview-Old Bethpage High School is now Plainview Old Bethpage Middle School.

Old Bethpage also had its own one room school house, named the Little Red Schoolhouse. This building, which stood until the 1970s, was located, appropriately enough, on Schoolhouse Road, just off of Round Swamp Road. The building was torn down and the property developed into several houses.

Closed Schools.
 Fern Place (now the Association for Children with Down Syndrome) ;
 Jamaica Avenue (now houses 2 day care centers, a private school, and hosts senior citizens' activities.);
 Joyce Road (now the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County);
 Manetto Hill Road (now the offices of the Mid-Island Y JCC of Plainview);
 Manetto Hill Road (now the Mid-Island Y JCC of Plainview- Main Building);
 Central Park Road (demolished);
 The Little Red School House (demolished);
 Oak Drive (demolished);

Recreation.
Parks.
Plainview has numerous community parks tucked in between homes. Its primary park is the 19 acre Plainview-Old Bethpage Community Park, located on Washington Avenue.   This park features an olympic size pool, a childrens pool, baseball/softball fields, tennis courts, racketball/handball courts, basketball courts and trails through its woods. During the summer the park runs a concession stand. Parks in Plainview are administered by either the Nassau County Department of Parks, Recreation and Museums or the Town of Oyster Bay. In addition, the town is home to a nature preserve called the Manetto Hills Park. This undeveloped parkland was the formerly known as the Shattuck Estate.

Sports.
Plainview Summer League Softball is a recreational softball league for citizens of the community.  It provides many hours of enjoyment and exercise for young members of the community in the summer.

Plainview-Old Bethpage Highlanders Soccer Club is the Youth Soccer League.

The Mid Island Y JCC has many activities for youths as well as seniors.

Greater Long Island Runners Club, formerly known as the Plainview-Old Bethpage Roadrunners Club, is the largest runners club on Long Island.

Media.
The PBS television station, WLIW, channel 21, broadcasts from Plainview.

Movies.
Until the 1980s there were several movie theaters in the community. Seeing their patrons go to the mutliplexes which were built in Hicksville and Commack, all the theaters were converted to office or retail use. 

 Century's Morton Village, Morton Village Shopping Center. This theater, located at the western end of the shopping center, was converted to retail space.
 Old Country Theater. Located at the intersection of Old Country Road and Manetto Hill Road. This theater was immediately west of the Shell gas station. The building was converted to an office building, housing mostly medical offices.
 RKO Plainview Twin. This movie theater was located behind the Plainview Centre on South Oyster Bay Road. This building was converted (and expanded) into today's Shoprite.
 The Plainview, A Century Theater. This theater was located on South Oyster Bay road (facing the Plainview Centre, noted above). It was converted into an office building, housing mostly medical offices.

Trivia.
 Jeffrey Miller, one of four students killed in the Kent State Massacre, was born and raised in Plainview.
 Plainview was home to at least two grand Gold Coast estates.
 The Schwarzenbach Estate. Robert Schwarzenbach was a very successful textile manufacturer, who purchased an estate on Manetto Hill. The house was demolished long ago to make way for homes, however, one outbuilding still exists. It is located in the Manetto Hills Shopping Center. This building, originally the home provided to the estate's gardener, was for many years, Malarkey's Tavern. The building is presently houses a veterinarian's office. In addition, until the 1990s, a second building was still standing. This building, which had been the estate's chicken coop, was converted into a residence, where the very gardener mentioned above, moved with his wife. It was located on Manetto Hill Road, just across from Nick Place. ;
 The Shattuck Estate. The Shattuck Estate was purchased by a successful New York City attorney, who lived there until he died in the 1960s. He was a member of the Shattuck family who owned the Frank G. Schrafft Company, which operated, among other things, a restaurant chain known as Schrafft Foods.  The property, which totals approximately 138 acres, was almost developed in the 1970s until community activists forced the county to purchase the property and leave it as a nature preserve.

Holiday stress is caused by heightened states of anxiety, typically during the months of November and December. This anxiety may be caused by financial instability, busy shopping malls, end of year deadlines, high workloads, depression, relationships, physical demands, or family stress.

The typical response to holiday stress is outright elimination through issue avoidance or medication, but this proves to be an ineffective method of stress management. The problem isn't the holiday season, but rather the trigger response to it.  The key to successful stress relief is proactive management, that is, taking action before the stress completely overwhelms and causes burnout and mental or physical illness.

 Signs of holiday stress .

Signs of holiday stress include: 
Feeling irritable;
Feeling overwhelmed;
Insomnia;

Sheldon "Shelley" Berman (born February 3, 1926) is an American comedian, writer, teacher, and actor. 

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Berman's early years were filled with dreams of the stage. After numerous failed serious plays, Berman found himself with The Compass Players, an improv comedy troupe, where he found his first success. This troupe would later became The Second City.

He left the group in 1957 and created his own comedy style. Contrasting with the frenetic, ad libbed style popular at the time, Berman's act was perfectly timed and poignant, while remaining improvised. This would be expected, given his theater background.

His preferred mode of delivery was seated on a high stool at center stage, as opposed to his contemporaries, who tended to stalk the stage or prop themselves up on a piano or microphone stand. His honest, biting, satiric comedy style soon found its niche.

His 1959 debut album, Inside Shelly Berman, won the first non-music Grammy Award ever, and the cover of that album cemented his image as a skinny guy sitting on a high chair, cigarette in one hand and a microphone in the other. He was the first standup comedian to appear in Carnegie Hall, and went on to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show over 20 times, The Jack Paar Show, and numerous other variety and TV specials throughout the 1960s.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Berman stayed out of the limelight following undisclosed personal issues and the death of his son. By 1989, he had returned to comedy by taking small roles. In 1995, Berman released a new live comedy album called Live Again! At the Improv. Since then, he has been part of numerous projects, including Curb Your Enthusiasm, Boston Legal, Friends, Arli$$, King of Queens, The Bernie Mac Show and Meet the Fockers. 

Since 1982, Berman has been teaching in the Master of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California, in the subject of Writing Humor, Literary and Dramatic. He has written three books, and continues to write and act.  In 2006, he hosted the annual Chabad Telethon broadcast in several cities.

Recursion (2004) is Tony Ballantyne's first novel. It is in the science fiction genre and follows three separate characters and their stories in a futuristic dystopia.

In Depth.

Of high import to the storyline is the concept of the singularity, a point in the near future when the evolution of technology reaches such a speed that thinking machines leave humans in the dust and we cannot possibly predict what will happen afterward; and that of von Neumann machines, self-replicating robots that use available raw resources to make copies of themselves.  The implication is that a system of such machines (just one of them would suffice, actually) that is allowed to reproduce unchecked will in short order devour entire biospheres, perhaps even entire solar systems or galaxies if these von Neumann machines are equipped with propulsion devices.  An interesting corollary to this is that if two systems of von Neumann machines are battling for resources, the winner will not be decided by which group has the most members.  The victorious system will be the one that reproduces faster.  Also brought up by Ballantyne is the interesting possibility of being copied and inserted into a simulation.  Some actually think it highly likely that WE are living in a simulated universe, due to certain observer selection effects.  A worthwhile read, wonderfully mind-bending concept.

Interception, or canopy interception, refers to precipitation that does not reach the soil, but is instead intercepted by the leaves and branches of plants. It occurs in the canopy, and in the forest ground litter. Because of evaporation, interception of liquid water leads to loss of that precipitation for the drainage basin. Intercepted snowfall does not result in any notable amount of evaporation, and most of the snow falls off the tree by wind or melt. However, intercepted snow can more easily drift with the wind, out of the watershed. Conifers have greater interception than hardwoods. Their needles gives them more surface area for droplets to adhere to, and they have foliage in spring and fall, therefore interception also depends on the type of vegetation in a wooded area.

HMS Campania was a seaplane and airplane carrier, and the first Royal Navy vessel to launch aircraft whilst underway. 

Originally built for Cunard Line's Liverpool-New York service in 1893, Campania was holder of the Blue Riband from 1893 to 1894, before losing it to her sister ship, Lucania. A collision with the barque Embleton on 21 July 1900 sank the latter, with loss of 11 lives. In 1904, a rogue wave swept five steerage passengers overboard, the first time in history the Cunard Line lost passengers through an accident. On 14 April 1914 she made her 250th crossing, before being sold to the shipbreakers TW Ward.

Campania was purchased by the Royal Navy on 27 November 1914 and converted to an aircraft carrier. As part of her Admiralty refit, in 1916 her fore funnel was removed and replaced by two smaller smoke pipes and a 160 foot wooden flight deck was added at the bow, making her capable of carrying ten Sopwith Pup fighters. Like many warships of the time she was painted in dazzle pattern.

For the majority of the war, the Campania worked out of Scapa Flow, however, in the autumn of 1918 she transferred operations to the Forth.  She missed the Battle of Jutland because of engine trouble. 

On the morning of November 5 1918, the Campania was lying at anchor in the Firth of Forth. Suddenly, in strong winds, the ship began to drag anchors. She collided with the nearby battleship, HMS Revenge, and a hole was torn up in the Campania s hull. The ship then started to settle by the stern. Two battleships stood by during the two hours it took for her to go to the bottom.

HMS Campania is now protected as a site of historic importance.

Kerala Police is the law enforcement agency for the state of Kerala, India. Unlike many countries like the United States, there is no local, county or district police forces in Kerala. Kerala Police has its headquarters in Trivandrum, the state capital. The motto of the force is Mridhu bhave dhrida karma which means "Soft in Temperament, Firm in Action" in Sanskrit .

Branches.
The Kerala Police has a general executive branch police wing, which mans the police stations in various towns and cities. There is a Crime Branch wing, which basically deals with sensational crimes or crimes which span across discricts. The Special Branch wing is the intelligence wing of the state police to deal with terrorism and anti-national activities. These two branches do not generally have uniform clothing. The Highway Police squads are manned by the general executive branch, with police men being taken on a shift basis from the police stations close to the highways.

The riot control wing of the State Police are based on two units.The riot control unit uses water dispencing unit called "VARUN" to desperse the rioters.They also uses grenades like tear gas shell,stinger grenade,dymarker,smoke grenade etc.They uses battons mad e of fibre and wood. The Armed Police Battalions, where recruits also undergo basic training. After service for stipulated time, based on the recruit's home district he gets transferred to the Armed Reserve Unit in his own district. After serving there, the constable is moved into a local police station in his district. There is an option for a recruit constable to stay back in the Armed Reserve and Armed Police Battalions. Then his promotions would be quicker, but he will not be stationed at any local police stations.

General Executive Branch officers (Sub Inspectors) are directly recruited (though a fair number would be promoted over time from the ranks), gets trained at the Police Academy, and gets posted to various police stations. They later pick up ranks to become Inspector, Deputy Superintendent or even a Superintendent based on the service records.

The lower post police unit is a Police Outpost generally under command of a Head Constable, or Assistant Sub Inspector. Above which comes a police station under command of a Sub Inspector (assisted by Additional Sub Inspectors if required). Two or more police stations forms a Police Circle, under an inspector (generally called CI or Circle Inspector). More than one circle form up a Police Sub Division which would be commanded by a Deputy Superindent of Police (designation is Assistant Superindent of Police for IPS officers). Many sub-divisions form a police district under a District Superintendent, above which comes Police Ranges and Zones. The police officers from the central govt. service of Indian Police Service (IPS) generally command the higher echelons of the Police Force. Every inspector can ear-mark approximately 15 police constables within his jurisdiction to form the Crime Squad. They work in non-uniform clothes (or mufti), and would be on the look out for pick pocketing, prostitution, hoodlum activities, and drug trafficking etc.

Battalions.
Kerala Police have seven Armed Police battalions which are:
 1st Bn. located at Ramvarmapuram, Thrissur ;
 2nd Bn. located at Muttikulangara, Palghat District ;
 3rd Bn. located at Adoor;
 4th Bn. located at Mangattuparamba, Kannur District;

Karl Gorath (born 12 December 1912, Bad Zwischenahn, Germany) is a gay man who was arrested in 1938 and imprisoned for the (then) crime of homosexuality at Neuengamme and Auschwitz.  He was freed in 1945.

Gorath was training for a nursing career when, at twenty-six, he was denounced as a homosexual by his "jealous lover" and arrested under paragraph 175 of the criminal code, which defined homosexuality as an unnatural act . 

Gorath was imprisoned at Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, and forced to wear a pink triangle, identifying him as gay and a transvestite. 

Because of his medical training, Gorath was transferred to work at a prisoner hospital in a sub-camp of Neuengamme, and was subsequently transferred to Auschwitz when he refused to decrease the bread ration for patients who were Poles.  At Auschwitz, Gorath wore the red triangle of a political prisoner, which, he believes, spared him the brutality inflicted on inmates identified as gay.  

In January 1945, Gorath was freed when the Allies liberated Auschwitz.

Gorath is one of six gay men who are the subject of a documentary on gays in Nazi concentration camps.  The film, by producers Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein and narrated by Rupert Everett, is called Paragraph 175.

Felix Teodor Hamrin (14 January 1875   27 November 1937) was a Swedish politician. He was the leader of the liberal Freeminded People's Party and served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 6 August to 24 September 1932.

Hamrin was born in Mönsterås in Kalmar County. His father was a dealer in leather. He married Elizabeth "Lizzie" Pennycock in 1900. They had seven children.

After studying at a business school in Gothenburg, he ran a wholesaling business in Jönköping from 1903 to 1930. He entered the Riksdag at the young age of 37, and under Carl Gustaf Ekman he served as Minister of Trade from 1926 to 1928 and as Minister of Finance from 1930 to 1932. When Ekman was forced to resign shortly before the elections in 1932 due to the Kreuger crash, Hamrin became prime minister. He resigned after the election because the Freeminded People's Party had suffered serious losses in the election. His term of office was only 50 days, giving him the record for serving the shortest amount of time as prime minister of Sweden.

He served briefly as party leader for the Freeminded People's Party after Ekman, and in the newly formed People's Party until a new party leader was chosen in January 1935. He also served as the governor of Jönköping County from 1930 to 1937. His most important political tasks were to fight the economic effects of the early years of the Depression in Sweden through severe economy measures, and to mitigate the effects of the Kreuger crash.

He died in Jönköping on 27 November 1937.

Fulling or walking ("waulking" in Scotland) is a step in clothmaking which involves the cleansing of cloth (particularly wool) to get rid of oils, dirt, and other impurities.

A fuller is the worker who does the job. In the process, fuller's earth was used.  (This is a soft earthy material occurring in nature as an impure hydrous aluminium silicate.) The cloth might also be washed. After washing, to prevent shrinkage and wrinkling, the cloth would be stretched on great frames known as tenters and held onto those frames by tenterhooks. It is from this process that we derive the phrase being on tenterhooks as meaning to be held in suspense. The area where the tenters were erected was known as a tenterground.

Originally, this was literally pounding the cloth with the fuller's feet, but from the medieval period it was often carried out in a water mill in which the cloth was beaten with wooden hammers, known as fulling stocks.  Such mills were known as fulling mills.

<doc id="1228884" title="Anarchist economics" nonfiltered="1075" processed="1061" dbindex="1481085">

Anarchist economics entails theory and practice relating to economic activity within the philosophical outlines of anarchism. Anarchists (most notably anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists) primarily oppose capitalism because they claim that its characteristic institutions promote and reproduce various forms of oppression, including private property, hierarchical production relations, collecting rents from private property, taking a profit in exchanges, and collecting interest on loans. Individualist anarchists are mutualist rather than collectivist or communist; they support possessive property rights but oppose usury - defining usury as profit from others' labor through rent, capital, interest, and wage-labor not paid "full" price. Finally, anarcho-capitalists fully support capitalism, but only the totally free-market laissez-faire kind.

Anarchist Critique of Capitalism.


Alternative Theories of Value and Currency.
Many anarchists advocate the abolition of money, but others call for a replacement of it with new value systems, still others, such as Benjamin Tucker, want simply the end of the government money monopoly, i.e. privatization of minting and banking and the repeal of legal tender laws.

Gift Economy.
Gift economies are those based of free distribution of goods and services. Anarcho-communists are the main proponents of such. However many times this is said to refer to a planned economy which ensures everyones needs are satisfied in a way that allows a good quality of life (the kind of planning advocated by most if not all anarchocommunists differs from that of firms and the so called command economies in that it is democratic and voluntary). There are a number of variations on the concept, but they are centered on the notion of "From each according to ability to each according to need". Primitivists also advocate this kind of economy (although they believe that it is not possible with current modes of production and thus advocate a return to pre-industrial and often pre-agricultural modes of production).

Labor Theory of Value.
A labor theory of value (LTV) was notably advanced in different forms by David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Ricardo held that the relative prices of most reproduceable goods and services were proportional to the amount of present and past labor time required to obtain, manufacture, process, distribute, and transport them. Marx's "Law of Value" is often interpreted as an analytic device elucidating the ways in which capitalism as a whole distributes socially necessary abstract labour time, while revealing that an important characteristic of commodities and their value relations is commodity fetishism obscuring an underlying reality of exploitative social relations. 

Recently, some local currencies have taken on LTV characteristics by having a currency based on time although participants are not primarily anarchists. Critics point out that in many of these Time-dollar based currencies, it is really easy to inflate the currency, that there is no way to ensure that people are not paid more than an HOUR per hour, and conversely it ignores factors like value-added work (work that incorporates past labor in order to perform, such as the time spent by a dentist in school). One of the reasons that the IRS has chosen not to tax local currencies is that they are used for charitable purposes, such as community-building.

Some anarchists are interested in LTV currency systems because they make complex free market, fair trade systems possible, although in their current practices they are not applicable for anything other than local (ie. town-sized) economies. Detractors argue that the definition of a free market precludes usage of a normative pricing system, but some anarchist point out that since participation in an LTV currency network is voluntary, any LTV system is merely another choice in a free market of markets.

Energy Theory of Value.
The theory that all values can be evaluated in terms of joules. In the same vein as LTV, this is an attempt to make a normative basis for value by accounting for embodied energy. Accounting for such a system would be vastly more complex than current or other theoretical currency systems because all energy output of workers and energy expenditure on goods/services must be tracked (something that is thought impossible and useless by many anarchists).

One group that has advocated a system using energy is the Technocratic movement with a system based on energy-credits where energy is used to "buy" a product or service without being exchanged, so the effect is that products or services are distributed to the user without gain by the provider (who has the same amount of energy in his or her account regardless) so allegedly making profit impossible.

Examples of Anarchist Economies.
Utopia (sometimes known as Trialville) was an individualist anarchist colony begun in 1847, by Josiah Warren and associates, in the United States on a tract of land approximately 30 miles from Cincinnati, Ohio. see also: mutualism and Cincinnati Time Store.

The anarchist collectives formed during the Spanish Civil War is the most famous example of an anarchist economy operating on a large scale. The collectives were formed under the influence of the anarcho-syndicalist union the CNT in rural and urban areas and successfully practised self-management for a number of years in extremely difficult economic and political circumstances. Other examples of self-management include the factory committee movement during the Russian Revolution and the workplace occupations in Argentina during its crisis at the turn of the 21st century. Attempts at forming co-operatives also appeared during the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Italian Factory Occupations of 1920.

Theoretical Anarchist Economic Systems.
Participatory Economics.


Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel began to write about Parecon in the 1980's. This work builds on their earlier critiques of both market-based and centrally planned economies suggesting instead allocation by participatory planning created by the democratic interaction of a network of production and consumption councils. Parecon is a market abolitionist theory. Though not strictly an "anarchist" idea, its core features of decentralized democratic planning, institutions and remuneration based upon egalitarian norms and self-management, balanced job roles, environmental responsibility, and social efficiency, appeals to many anarchists.

Mutualism.


Mutualism is a form of stateless market socialism advocated by Individualist Anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker. They argued that a free market in credit increase competition between lenders, make interest-free loans available. This would enable workers to buy their own means of production rather than having to sell their labour to a capitalist in order to survive, resulting in a form of market socialism where workers' cooperatives and self-employed individuals freely exchange goods and services.

Mutualism features a modification of the principle of private property, whereby communities or private defense agencies would only protect ownership of land, housing or workplaces on the basis of continual occupancy and use. In "What Is Property?" Pierre Jospeph Proudhon highlighted the distinction between ownership coinciding with use (possession) and absentee ownership (property) arguing that communities should only protect the former.

Proudhon also advocated that people create democratically controlled mutual credit associations or "peoples' banks", similar to local currency systems, rather than relying on the market to provide credit. These would lend only to cooperative workplaces, thus preventing the market from causing a relapse into capitalism.

Technological LTV Networks.
A revision of LTV that incorporates information technology, cryptography, and open-source software to create a medium of exchange that precludes all forms of usury and thus requires no oversight or ideological guidance. In contrast to Parecon, there is no planned economy because users of the system will approve of labor that they feel is necessary and so production happens as people fill the labor market as they will.

Crucial to this system is the premise that money (credit for work done) can be improved with the addition of identity, information, and transparency, i.e. all credits created are associated with a particular individual (they are non-transferable), they inform users of the work done to create it, and can be viewed by any user on the system.

There are no specifications for how decisions are made within these Technological LTV Systems - each one is tasked to create its own ruleset. Joining such a network would be akin to signing a contract or EULA so revision of rulesets would resemble the open-source paradigm of updating software and having the user agree to a new ruleset. Decision making would then be implicit in any user's ability to participate in the revision of the system software, even though this approach could be elitist.

Prices on goods and services would be evaluated by the amount of credit earned by laborers involved--requiring that every individual item or service be tracked. Production then represents a mirror of the credit creation, so physical items would require their "negative" credit to be cancelled by a person wishing to own it. Since income distribution would be relatively flat in this system, it is hoped that most of the problems of capitalist accumulation and class structure will be avoided.

Panarchist Synthesis.
This is the theory that all alternative economic systems could exist simultaneously. Though it may imply accepting a greater complexity of day-to-day living, anarchists predicate this overlapping of systems on the removal of states and corporations, and the presence of multiple currency paradigms. In effect, this would be analogous, on an individual level, to having various subscriptions or club memberships--a level of complexity surpassed by the average American middle-class consumer that holds several credit cards with various debts, owes mortage and car payments, and so forth.

The motive to adopt a panarchist approach to economics is the theory that not all goods, services, or resources are best exchanged/regulated within a single system, i.e. energy production is best tracked in kilowatt-hours, but collectible items have highly subjective values and therefore require a different exchange medium. Even Parecon could be incorporated in this approach.

Laissez-faire capitalism.


Separation of economics and State is the goal of anarcho-capitalists. They want an economy free from any coercive regulation or control. Anarcho-capitalists generally see the State as the cause of all monopoly. Anarcho-capitalists reject the labor theory of value as flawed and archaic.  Thus, like most modern economists, they do not believe that there is any proper price for labor or goods other than what someone is willing to pay. Therefore, unlike anarcho-communists, they do not wish to abolish money, wages, and trade. According to Rothard, in an interview with New Banner, "capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism." The place of anarcho-capitalism within anarchism is hotly debated.

Economics as Anarchist Strategy.
Some anti-capitalist anarchists believe that it is not radical political activity that will transform society, but radical economic activity that will make true change. They regard boycotts, consumer advocacy, and class-action lawsuits to be merely liberal actions that do not address the core problem which is capitalism itself.

Some anarchists believe that changing the nature of work itself is the crux of defeating capitalism. Parecon addresses the division of labor question by advocating balanced job complexes wherein all workers at a production facility share in all aspects of labor, i.e. everyone takes part in labor, management, maintenance, and all related work in order to ensure equality and that skills are shared amongst workers

Some anarchists believe that changing personal consumption habits to minimize (or eliminate entirely) involvement in the prevailing capitalist economy is essential to practicing anarchism in their lives. Withdrawing from the system by living on scavenged, stolen, or scammed resources is often touted by situationists, such as CrimethInc., as a viable means of survival and non-participation in the system. Many anarchists support counter-economics, that is, participating in the "black" illegal market.

Use of alternative currencies is growing, largely due to digital currencies offered on the internet, and availability of software to manage local currency systems like LETS.. Since States cannot collect taxes and revenue through use of alternative currencies they will theoretically lose power to the point of collapse. Some of these alternative currencies are designed to prevent usury, others are designed simply as alternatives to state-issued fiat money, as a hedge against inflation. Thus alternative currencies range from labor-time notes to specie-backed warehouse receipts. Three popular alternative currencies are: community currency, local currency, and time-based currency.

Brockworth, in Gloucestershire, England is situated on the old Roman road that connects the City of Gloucester with Barnwood, Hucclecote and Cirencester. For the past 150 years Brockworth has been known locally for the annual rolling of Double Gloucester cheese down Cooper's Hill. During World War II its Gloster Aircraft Company produced the famous Hurricane fighter, and following the War it gained renewed fame for producing several famous aircraft including the world's first jet aircraft which took off from its test runway.

Brief history.
Brockworth was the third in a series of rural villages located along an old Roman Road following a more-or-less straight line to the inland port city of Gloucester. Its original semi-remote location made it ideal for the location of an aircraft factory where planes could be built and tested without worry over noise. Land availability made the location ideal for the site of a test runway.

Gloster Aircraft Company.
The Gloster Aircraft Company was formed at Brockworth, Gloucestershire in 1915, as the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company. In 1926 the name of the company was abbreviated to Gloster because customers outside of the United Kingdom found the original name too difficult to pronounce. The company produced the Gloster Gladiator; Hawker Hurricane; Hawker Typhoon; Gloster Meteor and Gloster Javelin and its test runway became famous for the first flight of Sir Frank Whittle's turbo-jet aircraft.

Brockworth bombed.
The Brockworth aircraft factory drew upon an employment pool from the surrounding area and it was responsible for much of the growth in the development of housing estates which were halted by the outbreak of World War II. During the War Brockworth and the surrounding area was bombed by the Luftwaffe in an attempt to halt its production of vital war materials.

1939-1945 WWII production.
In 1939 the company built 1,000 Hawker Hurricanes in the first 12 months of World War II and it delivered its last of 2,750 Hurricanes in 1942. Production was the switched to building 3,330 Hawker Typhoons for the Royal Air Force. On April 8, 1941 the first test flight of the Gloster E28/39 with a turbo-jet engine invented by Sir Frank Whittle took off from company airfield at Brockworth. This formed the basis for the Gloster Meteor, the only jet to be used by the Allied Forces during World War II. In 1945 it gained a world speed record of 606 mph and it was eventually put into service by 12 nations.

Post-WWII developments.
Following World War II it took the area many years to revive; but after the mid-1950s, renewed housing growth, the development of motorways and redistricting eventually changed the entire look of Brockworth and what were once adjoining villages. In 1952 the Brockworth factory produced the two seat, delta-winged Gloster Javelin which was developed as an all weather fighter that could fly above 50,000 feet at almost the speed of sound. In 1962 the Gloster Aircraft Company closed down and its once famous test runway fell victim of redistricting and it is now within the boundary of Hucclecote. 

Cooper's Hill.
Cooper's Hill is a local landmark outside of Brockworth, and is known in Britain and beyond for its annual cheese rolling contest. A large round cheese is rolled down the steep slope of the hill and chased by a group of "runners", who in fact spend most of their brief descent to the bottom of the hill falling and tumbling. Two hundred years ago this was part of a larger mid-summer festival with other activities and competitions, but the event is now confined to the cheese-rolling and is held in May during the Spring Bank-holiday Monday. It is usually said to have originated as a pagan festival celebrating the arrival of summer, fertility, or both.

<doc id="2550039" title="Honky Tonk Women" nonfiltered="1078" processed="1064" dbindex="1481088">


"Honky Tonk Women" was a 1969 hit song by The Rolling Stones.  Released as a single on July 4, 1969 in the United Kingdom, and the next day in the United States, it topped the charts in both nations.  "You Can't Always Get What You Want" was the single's B-side.  

Two versions of the song were recorded by the band: the familiar hit which appeared on the 45 and their collection of late 1960s singles, Through The Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2); and a honky-tonk version entitled "Country Honk" with slightly different lyrics which appeared on Let It Bleed.

The single was released in England on the day after founding member Brian Jones' funeral.  Popular legend has that it Jones had written the riff shortly before he was fired from the band but this is not true.  The song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards while on vacation in Brazil in late December 1968/early January 1969.  Inspired by Brazilian gauchos/cowboys bringing cattle back to the ranch where Jagger and Richards were staying the song was originally conceived as an acoustic country song.  Thematically, a "honky tonk woman" refers to a dancing girl in a western bar who may work as a prostitute; the setting for the Blues narrative version is Memphis while Country Honk sets the first verse in Jackson. Recorded in London in early February 1969 without Jones present, the band initially recorded the 'Country Honk'.  New band member Mick Taylor was responsible for transforming the song into the familiar electric, riff-based hit single 'Honky Tonk Women' some time in the spring of 1969. The song is distinctive among the Stones' catalog as it opens not with riff, but with the single beat of a cowbell. The Stones' producer Jimmy Miller performed it for the recording and, interestingly, while most live versions of the song do utilize the cowbell, it has never opened the song. Live takes are included on the albums Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!, Love You Live, and Live Licks.

Richards claimed he took the opening riff from Ry Cooder, who taught Richards how to play in the "open-G" guitar tuning that he used on that song and many other Stones songs.  Cooder has accused the Stones of "ripping him off," and to date refuses to speak in specifics about his sessions with the Stones. Stones pianist Ian Stewart also disliked the song: "It's bloody ten times Keith you hear." 

The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks from August 23, 1969. It was preceded by "In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" by Zager and Evans and followed by "Sugar, Sugar" by The Archies.

Rolling Stone ranked it #116 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Country Honk.
Gram Parsons claimed to have been responsible for the Country Honk arrangement although this claim is disputed by Jagger and Richards.  According to Byron Berline (who memorably played fiddle on the track) Parsons was certainly responsible for him being hired to play on the recording.  Berline had previously recorded with Parson's band The Flying Burrito Brothers among many others.

The track was recorded at Elektra Studios on La Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, with producer Glyn Johns suggesting that Berline actually record his part on the sidewalk outside the studio to add ambience to the track.  The car horn also resulted from the sidewalk recording. Actress Nanette Newman performs backing vocals on this version.

a Dicto simpliciter (Latin: "from a maxim without qualification" -- meaning 'from a universal rule') or ad Dictum simpliciter (Latin: "to a maxim without qualification" -- meaning 'to a universal rule') The a (meaning "from" is often omitted when this phrase is used in English, being mistaken for an indefinite article.

"Dicto simpliciter" fallacies are deductive logical fallacies that occur in  statistical syllogisms. A dicto simpliciter occurs when an acceptable exception is ignored or eliminated.  For instance, the appropriateness of using opiates is dependent on the presence of extreme pain.  To justify the recreational use of opiates by referring to a cancer patient or to justify arresting said cancer patient by comparing him to the recreational user would be a dicto simpliciter.
  

There are exactly two kinds of dicto simpliciter:

Accident -- a dicto simpliciter ad dictum secundum quid (Where an acceptable exception is ignored.) general to qualified;
Converse accident -- a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter (Where an acceptable exception is eliminated or simplified.) qualified to general;

For inductive fallacies that may affect the soundness of some statistical syllogisms, see faulty generalization.

Card stacking often uses dicto simpliciter.

Hi Ho Silver Lining is a still-popular 1960s rock song, written by Scott English  and Larry Weiss, first released as single in March 1967 by  The Attack and a few days later by  Jeff Beck, whilst Jeff Beck's version charted. It has been re-recorded many times (mostly recently in 2006) and retains its popularity on the dance-floor, perhaps because of its zany words, well-known accompanying gestures (eg both arms raised upwards to the words 'I see your sun is shining') and highly rhythmic accompaniment. Modified versions of it are sung by some British football supporters (eg at Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday and Wolverhampton Wanderers).

Other recorded versions exist by Black Lace, Slade, Hello, John Leyton (as "Hi Ho, Come On England")

Upside-down catfish, Synodontis nigriventris, is a species of catfish. It's particularly noteworthy because of its habit of swimming upside down most of the time. This is reflected in the fish's pigmentation their bellies are darker than their backs.

The upside-down catfish is well suited to aquariums because of its small size (typically 9 or 10 cm or less) and peaceful demeanor. It fares best in schools of up to half a dozen.

<doc id="184723" title="Vega 2" nonfiltered="1089" processed="1074" dbindex="1481099">

Vega 1 and 2 were identical sister ships part of the Vega program. The spacecraft was a development of the earlier Venera craft. They were designed by Babakin Space Center and constructed as 5VK by Lavochkin at Khimki. The craft was powered by twin large solar panels and instruments included an antenna dish, cameras, spectrometer, infrared sounder, magnetometers (MISCHA), and plasma probes. The 4,920 kg craft was launched by a Proton 8K82K rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Kazakh SSR.  Both Vega 1 and 2 were three-axis stablized spacecraft.  The spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from the comet. 

 The Venus mission .
Vega 2 arrived at Venus on on June 15, 1985. Its 1500 kg, 240 cm diameter spherical descent unit was released some days before arrival and entered the atmosphere without active inclination changes. It contained a lander and a balloon explorer.

Descent craft.
The Vega 2 lander touched down at 03:00:50 UT on 15 June 1985 at 8.5° S, 164.5° E, in eastern Aphrodite Terra. The altitude of the touchdown site was 0.1 km above the planetary mean radius. The measured pressure at the landing site was 91 atm and the temperature was 736 K. The surface sample was found to be an anorthosite-troctolite. It transmitted data from the surface for 56 minutes.

Balloon.
The Vega 2 Lander/Balloon capsule entered the Venus atmosphere (125 km altitude) at 2:06:04 UT (Earth received time; Moscow time 5:06:04 a.m.) on 15 June 1985 at roughly 11 km/s. At approximately 2:06:19 UT the parachute attached to the landing craft cap opened at an altitude of 64 km. The cap and parachute were released 15 seconds later at 63 km altitude. The balloon package was pulled out of its compartment by parachute 40 seconds later at 61 km altitude, at 7.45 degrees S, 179.8 degrees east. A second parachute opened at an altitude of 55 km, 200 seconds after entry, extracting the furled balloon. The balloon was inflated 100 seconds later at 54 km and the parachute and inflation system were jettisoned. The ballast was jettisoned when the balloon reached roughly 50 km and the balloon floated back to a stable height between 53 and 54 km some 15 to 25 minutes after entry. The mean stable height was 53.6 km, with a pressure of 535 mbar and a temperature of 308-316 K in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. The balloon drifted westward in the zonal wind flow with an average speed of about 66 m/s at nearly constant latitude. The probe crossed the terminator from night to day at 9:10 UT on 16 June after traversing 7400 km. The probe continued to operate in the daytime until the final transmission was received at 00:38 UT on 17 June from 7.5 S, 76.3 E after a total traverse distance of 11,100 km. It is not known how much further the balloon travelled after the final communication.

 The Halley mission .
After their encounters, the Vegas' motherships were redirected by Venus' gravity to intercept Comet Halley.

Vega 2 made its closest approach on March 9, 1986 at 8,030 km. The data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach. They were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus, such as dimensions, shape, temperature and surface properties, as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma, the gas composition close to the nucleus, the dust particles' composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus and the cometary-solar wind interaction.

Vega 2 returned similar data as its sister probe, Vega1, the images were of better clarity due to its closer approach.

In total Vega 1 and Vega 2 returned about 1500 images of Comet Halley. Spacecraft operations were discontinued a few weeks after the Halley encounters. 

Vega 1 and 2 are currently in heliocentric orbits.

Gymnema sylvestre is a herb native to the tropical forests of sothern and central India where it  has been used as a naturopathic treatment for diabetes for nearly two millennia. 
 
Use as herbal medicine.
While it is still being studied, and the effects of the herb are not entirely known, the herb has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels when used for an extended period of time. Additionally, this Gymnema alters the taste of sugar when it is placed in the mouth, thus some use it to fight sugar cravings. This effect, however, is short-lived, lasting a mere fifteen minutes.  Some postulate that the herb actually reduces cravings for sugar by blocking sugar receptors in the tongue, but no scientific studies have supported this hypothesis. It is currently being used in an all natural medication for diabetes with other ingredients such as cinnamon, chromium, zinc, biotin, banaba, huckleberry and bitter melon.

The active ingredient is thought to gurmenic acid which has structure similar to saccharose. Extracts of Gymnema is not only claimed to curb sweet tooths but also for treatment of as varied problems as hyperglycemia, overweightness, high cholesterol levels, anemia and digestion. According to the Sushruta of the Ayurveda it is helps to treat Madhumeha ie glycosuria. 

Alternative names.
The plants also goes under many other names such as; Gurmari, Gurmarbooti, Gurmar, periploca of the woods, meshasring  and mesbasringi. The hindi word gur-mar literally means sugar destroyer. Mesbasringi means ram's horn because of the shape of its fruits. Gymnema probably derives from the Latin word meaning naked and sylvestre means from the forest.

Mechanicles is a fictional character in the Disney cartoon series Aladdin, voiced by Charlie Adler. A villain who seems to be of an ancient Greek culture (always styling himself as "greatest of the great Greek geniuses"), he is known for being able to make complex technological robots resembling insects (particuarly beetles), which he uses for his various plots.

Other than his large ego, Mechanicles seems to have an obsessive-compulsive need for cleanliness and order; Aladdin and the other heroes usually find themselves able to distract him by something simple, for example spilling oil on his tile floor. 
Trivia.
According to a game called Aladdin's Awesome Adventure, Mechanicles is somewhat worse than Abis Mal.

<doc id="6064132" title="U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin" nonfiltered="1094" processed="1079" dbindex="1481104">

In the U.S. state of Wisconsin, U.S. Route 10 (normally called U.S. Highway 10, Highway 10 or US 10) runs east-west across the central part of the state. It runs from the Prescott Drawbridge over the St. Croix River at Prescott, where it enters Minnesota, east to the dock in Manitowoc where the Lake Michigan Carferry (SS Badger) crosses Lake Michigan to Ludington, Michigan.

History.
Prior to 1926, what is now US 10 was State Trunk Highway 18. However, Highway 18 initially (in 1917) only ran from Humbird, near where US 10 and U.S. Highway 12 (then State Trunk Highway 12) cross, east to Manitowoc. State Trunk Highway 34 ran from Prescott to Highway 37 in Mondovi. The route between Mondovi and Humbird was not numbered until the early 1920s, when Highway 18 was extended west from Humbird past Mondovi to Prescott, eliminating Highway 34.

When US 10 was designated in late 1926, it ran along U.S. Highway 12 from Minnesota east to Humbird, splitting there to run to Manitowoc. The piece of former Highway 18 west of Humbird became Highway 34, as the number 18 conflicted with U.S. Highway 18. In 1934, Highway 34 disappeared again, as US 10 was separated from the US 12 concurrency to run along it.

<doc id="7689281" title="Sonoma Coast State Beach" nonfiltered="1096" processed="1081" dbindex="1481106">


Sonoma Coast State Beach is a State of California property in Sonoma County consisting of public access use on lands adjoining the Pacific Ocean.   This extent of beach runs from a coastal point about four miles north of Jenner and continues for approximately seventeen miles to the south to terminate at Bodega Head. The property lies along California State Route 1 and consists of a number of named beaches including Arched Rock Beach, Gleason Beach and Goat Rock Beach.  The ecosystem consists of alternating sandy beaches and rocky shoreline, with a marine terrace extending above the entire extent with an upland California coastal prairie habitat. 

Geology.

This strip of coastal property is subject to continuing marine erosion as well as windborne erosion, thus creating a situation where an average of one to three feet per year of land mass is lost.  Obviously in years of heavy storms this value can be higher, whereas, in a less stormy year the land erosion can be lower. Over the last geologic epoch the land has been subject to uplift, a process which has created a marine terrace of the entire extent of the property.  This marine terrace is elevated approximately 50 to 100 feet above mean sea level, which results in a steep bluff directly above the littoral zone.

Vertical rock formations are a geological hallmark of this site, and have weathered far less than the bulk of the soils.  These features are known as sea stacks, and they appear standing out of the water or on the beach as though as sculptures placed decoratively along the shoreline. Occasionally these stacks appear as adornments on the marine terrace, indicating their ancient origin on the sea floor prior to uplift.  These rock formations are composed of sandstone with layers of quartz.

The active San Andreas Fault runs roughly parallel and near to the coastline of Sonoma Coast State Beach.  Soils within the site are classified as coastal beach sands (where rocky shoreline is not evident) and marine escarpment group soils on the marine terrace; typically soils above the marine terrace are in the Rohnerville loam group.  Most of the beach sands consist of a medium coarse brown to gray sandy materials, reflecting the high rate of erosion of escarpment soils into the ocean; however, there are patches of smooth pebble beach such as the approximately one hundred meter stretch lying immediately north of Goat Rock.

Ecology.

The habitats include marine, littoral and coastal prairie.  In the marine environment are found gray whales, harbor seals and California sea lions as well as a multitude of fish species and other marine organisms.  There are also modest kelp beds and other marine vegetation. The littoral beach environment has fewer organisms than more southerly zones, because of the colder temperatures; however, there are tidepools which are abundant with marine flora and fauna.

The coastal prairie soils are moderately well drained and granular in nature with moderate soil permeability; these features lead to slight erosion potential and moderately high bio-productivity.  Acidity of these loamy soils is medium to high, and thus some vegetative stunting and hospitality to rare plants is offered. The upland environment on the coastal prairie offers a variety of grasses and wildflowers including varieties of lupine, thistle and wild oats.  The typical annual plant productivity is approximately 1500 kilograms per acre of air dried yield per annum in an abundant moisture year, and about half that amount in a very dry year.  A variety of birds and mammals thrive on the coastal prairie including numerous California Mule Deer, Odocoileus hemionus californicus.

History.

Some of the oldest natural history of this area related to mammals are a rock formation about one mile south of the Russian River.  There is found a sea stack formation with prominent rubbing marks about two to four meters in elevation, a height too high to have been caused by modern bovids.  Mammoths are believed to have roamed here as recently as 40,000 years ago, and they are thought to have created these severe rubbing marks.  Mammoth fossil remains have been found at Bodega Head at the south end of Sonoma Coast State Beach.   

Earliest known human settlement of this site was by the Native American Coast Miwok and Pomo tribes.  As early as 1849 archaeological finds were recorded on this property, and to date dozens of prehistorical kitchen middens and other types of tribal habitation finds have been made.  The property is part of a Mexican land grant called Bodega Rancho. The Russians are thought to have begun logging the old-growth forests directly above the coastal prairie in the early 1800s.

The underwater delineation of the property is considered to extend to 1000 feet from the shoreline.  While no shipwrecks have been discovered, the literature indicates that there are 17 vessels which may have been lost in these waters.  There are remains of numerous historic barns and other agricultural buildings on the coastal prairie indicating 19th century settlement by Europeans; at Duncans Landing there are iron pins embedded in the sandstone bluffs as evidence of the active shipping industry here in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Luigino Celestino Di Agostino, better known as Gigi D'Agostino, (born 17 December, 1967, Torino, Italy) is a DJ, remixer and music producer. In 1986 he started his career as a DJ spinning Italo Disco, and releasing his first mix "Psychodelic". 

Biography.

Gigi D'Agostino spent an eventful childhood between Torino and Brescia (where the Media Records studios are placed). As a child, Gigi D'Agostino always had a big hope: to be someone in the world of the disco music. Working first as a mason and fitter, he started his musical career as a DJ by organizing parties in clubs. His debut was in a club near Torino (Italy) called "Woodstock". He was a resident DJ of Ultimo Impero (an Italian disco) from 1993 to 1998.

D'Agostino's first release was "Noise Maker Theme", a double-A sided record with a track by Daniele Gas on the other side, which launched the Noise Maker label, under the direction of Italian house producer Gianfranco Bortolotti. D'Agostino would continue working with Daniele Gas, as well as Mauro Picotto's production team for the following years.

His 1999 single "Bla Bla Bla" became a major European hit. He described this single as "a piece I wrote thinking of all the people who talk and talk without saying anything!" Other hit singles included L'Amour Toujours, Another Way, La Passion, The Riddle, as well as Super (1, 2, 3) Carillon (remix of Italian DJ Magic Box), and more recently Goodnight.

As a DJ, Gigi D'Agostino is known as one of the "pioneers of Mediterranean Progressive Dance"  consisting of minimalistic sounds and catchy, latin melodies and especially mediterranean melodies. As a producer, Gigi D Agostino s strength - or "Gigi Dag", the pseudonym he uses for himself in club productions - lies in transforming a piece, originally destined only for the discos, into a success for the main-stream public.



After successes like Sweetly, he entered in the team of Gianfranco Bortolotti, the general manager of Media Records and suddenly reached the top of the hit parades. His single FLY, published in 1996 with BXR Noise Maker, the label created by Media Records for the Mediterranean Progressive house, reached the top of the sales in Italy. This was followed by his single Gigi's Violin which was very popular in clubs and in the national and European music networks. It confirmed the Mediterranean Progressive House as an overground phenomenon.

Following on from this success, Gigi D'Agostino released the song Angel's Symphony with R.A.F. by Mauro Picotto, a friend from Media Records. His biggest project was the self-titled album Gigi D'Agostino - consisting of 19 tracks, it sold over 60,000 copies and as a result turned gold.


With Gigi D'Agostino's increased popularity, his musical style has changed, with his sound becoming more melodic, at midway between House and Progressive, with more energetical and melodical sonorities and less obsessive rhythms.

In 1997 he released the single Gin Lemon, and in 1998 Elisir (Your Love), an instant success. 

In 1999 Gigi D'Agostino released the single Cuba Libre, followed by Bla Bla Bla, also an instant success. He later released the album Eurodance Compilation which contained 5 unpublished tracks. With this compilation he obtained the Platinum Disc and was awarded with "Best Producer in 1999" at the Italian Dance Awards. In October, Gigi D Agostino released another hit single, this time Another Way.

In 1999, his album, L'Amour Toujours (released in 2001 in the United States), consisting of 23 tracks on two CDs including the song "L'Amour Toujours", brought him to the 10th position in the sales parade in Italy and as a result he reached the Platinum Disc.

2000s: Un Giorno Credi and more.
In 2000, his song "The Riddle" sold 1,000,000 copies in Germany, and 200,000 copies in France. He also released the album Tecno Fes in August 2000, and Tecno Fes E.P. Vol. 2 in December 2000.

In 2001 he released L'Amour Toujours E.P., consisting of 3 songs: two new versions of L'amour Toujours and Un Giorno Credi, a single made in collaboration with Edoardo Bennato. Un Giorno Credi reached the top of the parades in Italy and became one of the most played songs in the national and international music networks. He was also awarded with "Best DJ-producer of the year" at the "Red Bull Awards" in Italy.

In 2001 he also released the hit "Super", as a result of a collaboration with Albertino (an Italian music artist), which won him the awards "Best Dance Producer" at the PIM (Italian Music Award); and "Public Award" at the Danish DJs Award in Copenhagen, Denmark. In December of that year he released Il Grande Viaggio, a compilation of his favourite songs, including old electronic pieces and new rhythms and melodies. As a result, he was awarded with "Best Dance Producer" at the Italian Dance Awards.

On July 15, 2004, his compilation "Euro Dance" won Platinum certification with 120,000 copies sold in a few weeks.

Gigi D'Agostino has played in some well known clubs throughout Europe including in Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and England (in 1996 he played at the Ministry of Sound in London with Mauro Picotto) .

In 2006 he created his own new record label, called "Noisemaker Hard", to differentiate the style of music released under his older record label, "Noisemaker".

 Summary .
VíaVienté (commonly typed as ViaViente)is a company based out of Plano, TX led by businessman Craig Keeland. The company markets an all-natural, whole food liquid tonic. Although the company explicitly says they do not make any medical claims at all, many customers claim to have many health concerns positively effected. As of  2006 they have had customers in the  United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico and Taiwan. The company claims that they are projected to be in 50 different countries within the next 5 years. Only existing users are allowed to refer the product directly to the consumer to help save advertising costs.

 Management Team .


In 1991, Craig Keeland wanted to find a way to slow down the aging process. He often cites that as a little boy he always fascinated by the legendary Fountain of Youth. After graduating from the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania Craig had several successful ventures in commercial real estate and banking helping him become a multi-millionaire. He used his vast wealth and resources to achieve his life long dream of slowing down the aging process. Over a decade later, the first bottle of VíaVienté was produced.

Craig wanted to have a stellar management team put together. Some of the most notable names include Gary Forester, the current Vice President of Operations, who worked with former Presidential candidate Ross Perot in Perot's company EDS. Mr. Forester worked with EDS for 22 years and is seen by many as one of the company's chief architects of turning it into the billion dollar giant it eventually became.

 Formulation History.


In the January of 1973 edition of National Geographic magazine, Dr. Alexander Leaf of Harvard University looked at the historic village of Vilcabamba located in the Andes mountain region of Ecuador in South America. Many cite that about 1 in 64 people in the village live to the age of 100 years or older. 

Almost a decade later, Dr. Morton Walker, a doctor in nutrition, wrote an unpublished manuscript called The Secret to a Youthful Long Life. Dr. Walker claims that the mineral profile of the water available to the village and the nutrients found in the fruits was a perfect match with the blood of select residents of Vilcabamba after doing a DNA analysis. He often cites it as literally "we are what we eat."

Dr. Walker was known by Dr. Harvey Ashmeade of Albion Laboratories which owns many patents in the chelation process of minerals. It was Dr. Ashmeade whom Craig Keeland first consulted. Dr. Ashmeade referred Craig to Dr. Morton Walker's manuscript. 

Dr. Mark Pedersen was eventually involved in the project to find a way to make the product palatable. Dr. Pedersen is a Naturopathic Doctor and has had over 2 decades of experience in formulation processes. Dr. Pedersen is often read by many students in herbology and other wellness fields in institutions around the world. 

Dr. Richard Cutler, formerly of the National Institute of Health, was also brought on to the project due to his extensive work in anti-oxidant research.

Dr. Linus Pauling, considered by many the "father of Vitamin C" and a recipient of the Nobel Prize, was also consulted on the product shortly before he died. Craig Keeland was in fact one of the last non-family members to have spoken to him before his passing.

VíaVienté uses a patent pending process use cold-compression to take the entire fruit (skin, pulp, seeds) and turn it into a liquid form. This process claims all the natural enzymes of the fruit are preserved and classifies it as a whole food tonic as opposed to a dietary supplement and/or a juice. VíaVienté claims that consumption of the product helps the body become alkaline. Alkaline bodies have been alleged by many medical professionals to disallow growth of diseases such as cancer although this idea has been disputed. VíaVienté itself ardently denies any claims of cures, treatments or prevention of any diseases or medical conditions but does issue a money back guarantee to its customers if not satisfied.

 Ingredients .

VíaVienté has 9 whole fruits and 2 whole roots. These include:

Grape;
Chinese Scullcap;
Gentain;
Bilberry;
Blueberry;
Prune;
Elderberry;
Noni;
Cranberry;
Apple;
Aloe Vera;

The product also has 13 minerals and as of 2006 claims to be the only liquid product with vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories.

 Independent Validation .
On January 19, 2007 at the VíaVienté World Wide Conference, the company announced that Brunswick Laboratories located outside of Boston, Massachusetts would be giving its first official seal of certification to be placed on every bottle of VíaVienté. Brunswick is highly regarded by many nutritional experts as the standard to which food laboratories should be held to and has invented the ORAC scale (Oxygen Radical Absorbant Capacity) that measures anti-oxidant potentials in different foods and products.

VíaVienté has voluntarily submitted to clinical trials conducted by Brunswick Laboratories and the Miami Research Associates based out of Florida. According to the study, VíaVienté was proven to reduce joint pain, joint stiffness, blood pressure, blood sugar and heart rate in the double blind clinical trial. 

Several other competitors of VíaVienté such as Xango, Tahitian Noni and Goji were also measured for their ORAC values in the study. VíaVienté was shown to have a higher ORAC score than all three of those products combined .

TIME Magazine has allowed a reprint of their February 2004 issue talking about the link between inflammation and disease to have the VíaVienté logo on the front and the back of the reprint as a possible solution.

Hall of Fame NFL Quarterback and noted sports celebrity Terry Bradshaw has said he benefited from VíaVienté to help his aches and pains. On January 3, 2005, MSNBC aired a clip of Terry Bradshaw promoting the benefits of the product. This clip was re-aired on CNBC and CNN Headline News. VíaVienté claims neither Bradshaw nor the networks received money for the promotion.

Recently, Bradshaw has partnered with actress Linda Gray of the hit drama Dallas (TV series) to promote VíaVienté in a video that is available from the distributors of the company.

Olympic Figure Skating Gold Medalist and breast cancer survivor Peggy Flemming has promoted the product on numerous news networks as well.

VíaVienté claims that Governor Rick Perry of Texas drinks a bottle a week and has personally thanked CEO Craig Keeland for his renewed energy.

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has been pictured with Craig Keeland holding a bottle of VíaVienté. 

Senator John McCain of Arizona has said he wished VíaVienté was around for his family according to an issue of the company's newsletter where McCain was pictured.

Former boxer, noted celebrity Muhammad Ali has been a customer as well. Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, has been rumored by his wife Loni to be in better health than she has seen him 10 years.

The Dallas Morning News newspaper on April 23, 2006 wrote an article titled Here s to your Health - and your Wealth that mentioned the company's success.

The WB Network's affiliate in Dallas aired a segment done by Victoria Snee on the company.

The company also has set up the Andes Children's Foundation to help educate the children of the Vilcabamba valley by sending back significant profits to the area. A video done by the company about the Foundation can seen here.

Note: Mostly distributors and users of the drink make any claims about the effects of the tonic as seen from a customer posted website, however, the third party links can be followed above for further research into the independent validation. The company itself neglects any claims of healing or cures (http://www.viaviente.com/) in order to fend off regulation and lawsuits but has issued a money back guarantee for anyone consistently taking the product with their "12 Weeks to Optimum Health Challenge."

<doc id="4246725" title="Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry" nonfiltered="1105" processed="1090" dbindex="1481115">
The Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry (est.1907, closed 1990), also known as Byberry Mental Hospital, opened in 1907 in Northeast Philadelphia. It originally followed the theory of physician Benjamin Rush that mental illness was a disease and could be cured with proper treatment, but the mentally diseased should be kept away from normal people until they were actually cured. It was home to people ranging from the mentally challenged to the criminally insane. The primary buildings were constructed between 1910 and the mid-1920's, and the newer buildings were constructed between 1940 and 1953. It was composed of over fifty buildings which included male and female dormitories, an infirmary, kitchens, laundry, administration, a chapel and a morgue. The hospital's population grew rapidly, quickly exceeding its capacity, and conditions were extremely poor. 

Several investigations into the conditions at the hospital revealed that sewage lined the hallways and patients slept in the halls, and administration mistreated and exploited patients. As a result, in 1936, the hospital was turned over to the state.  However, the state possession changed nothing, and further investigations publicized similar findings. 

In his 1948 book, The Shame of the States, Albert Deutsch described the horrid conditions he observed at Byberry: "As I passed through some of Byberry's wards, I was reminded of the pictures of the Nazi concentration camps. I entered a building swarming with naked humans herded like cattle and treated with less concern, pervaded by a fetid odor so heavy, so nauseating, that the stench seemed to have almost a physical existence of its own."  In the 1960's the hospital began downsizing.  The downsizing continued until its closing.

 Horrible Conditions Continue .
In the mid 1980s, Philadelphia State Hospital came under scrutiny when it was learned that violent criminals were being kept on the hospital's Forensic Ward (N8-2A).  In 1985, the hospital failed a state inspection, and was accused of misleading the inspection team about certain issues, with overcrowding being the top problem.

Reports of patient abuse were still rampant through the 1980s.  One patient had reported that one of his teeth was pulled without Novacaine.    Another famous story of patient abuse was that of William Kirsch in 1987, who was shackled to a bed for 14 months.  Another state inspection team was sent to evaluate the hospital in early 1987.  By the summer of '87, 5 of Philadelphia State Hospital's top officials were promptly fired after the hospital once again failed the state inspection.

 Closure of Byberry .
On December 7th, 1987, a press conference was held to announce the closing of the Philadelphia State Hospital. The teams most recently performing investigations described the conditions as "atrocious" and "irreversible." Though originally supposed to close the following year, patient issues delayed the process. Mostly the fact that two released patients were found dead in the Delaware river in two successive days after their release.  The hospital officially closed in June of 1990, with the remaining patients and staff having been transferred to Norristown State Hospital or local community centers.

 Period of Abandonment 1990-2006.
It did not take long for people to re-discover Byberry after it closed. Looters broke in several weeks after the closing and began to steal everything of value, especially copper piping and wiring, while contaminating the buildings with asbestos, which prevented the city from demolishing the buildings in 1991. After the looters had removed everything of value, vandals and urban explorers trespassed on the grounds. Explorers carefully wandered the hallways, and corridors of their newley abandoned prize; while  vandals smashed windows, and started fires. It was rare to see a summer night go by without the fire department having to be called to the former hospital.

By 2000 Byberry saw an explosion of people visiting the abandoned hospital, the internet offered extremely exaggerated stories and legends, as well tips on gaining access to the abandoned buildings while avoiding police and security. By 2003, the Philadelphia State Hospital site was a complete and utter ruin; graffiti covered every buildings exterior and interior, every window was smashed and boarded with plywood, and anything flammable remaining when the hospital closed was now ashes. The residents of Somerton were now pressuring the city to end the "Byberry Problem" once and for all. In May of 2006   the "Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation" the owners of the former Hospital, sold all the remaining buildings and land to "Brandywine Reality" who promised to swiftly demolish the former hospital and develop the land.

 Demolition .

On June 14, 2006, a ceremony was held to celebrate the beginning of the complete demolition of the former Byberry hospital, and the future cosntruction of an adult living community on the former hosiptal grounds. "Geppert Brothers" demolition was hired to demolish the buildings, while "Delta Removal"  was hired to remove hazardous materials; such as lead paint, and asbestos. Abatement and demolition started with "C" buildings, followed by the "W" buildings, and will be ending with the "N" buildings. No explosives were used in the demolition of any of the buildings.

The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers is a trade union in the United States and Canada. It is for boilermakers and related occupations, and is affiliated with the AFL-CIO.
The Boilermakers union has a 4 year apprenticeship training program before becoming a Journeyman. Boilermakers primarily work in nuclear and fossil power plants. However they also work in refineries and chemical plants. The work involves welding, rigging and fabricating. All work done is governed by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration).

 History Of The Boilermakers .

The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers was born on September 1, 1893. On that day, at a meeting in Chicago, Illinois, representatives from the International Brotherhood of Boiler Makers and Iron Ship Builders, which had been organized on October 1, 1880, and the National Brotherhood of Boiler Makers, which had been formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in May of 1888, resolved to consolidate their organizations. It was further agreed that the new organization, to be known as the Brotherhood of Boiler Makers and Iron Ship Builders of America, would make its Headquarters in Kansas City, Kansas.

Two and a half years later, on the ninth of June 1896, the Brotherhood affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.

In subsequent years, the Brotherhood continued to grow, and in 1902, the Helpers division was formed. Because helpers were barred from sitting in the lodge room with mechanics, this new division had its own local unions and was entirely separate from the Boiler Makers. This would change a decade later when the Helpers Division would be consolidated with the Mechanics Division.

In March 1906, at a special Convention in Kansas City, the name of the Union was changed to the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders and Helpers of America in order to incorporate the newest division. Also at this time, the term "Boiler Makers" was condensed into one word, "Boilermakers."

The Boilermakers affiliated with the Building Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor in February 1931. At the turn of the century, total membership stood at about 8,500, but by 1944, due in part to dramatic increases in the shipbuilding, railroad, and fabrication shop industries during World War II, the Boilermakers numbered over 350,000.

In 1954, the Boilermakers merged their organization with the International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths, Drop Forgers and Helpers. The International Brotherhood of Blacksmiths had been organized in 1889 and added Helpers to both their membership and their name in 1901. A 1919 merger with the Brotherhood of Drop Forgers created the union that, on June 29, 1953, merged with the Boilermakers to create the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. A year later, a new International seal was adopted to include all crafts.

On October 1, 1954, the Boilermaker National Health and Welfare Fund was established, on November 9, 1959, the Boilermakers National Joint Apprenticeship Fund began, and the Boilermaker-Blacksmith National Pension Trust became effective October 1, 1960.

Delegates to the 1977 convention voted to establish a Construction Division at International Headquarters for the purpose of servicing those members with employment in, or related to, the construction industry.

On March 15, 1984, the delegates to the Special Merger Convention of the United Cement, Lime, Gypsum and Allied Workers International Union voted to merge with the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers. The merger of the CLGAW, formed in 1936, and its 10,000 members who dominate the building products and supplies industry, and the Boilermakers forged an organization with a greater ability to provide services to its members.

On October 1, 1994, a merger was consummated with the Stove, Furnace and Allied Appliance Workers International Union a skilled trade union that was organized in 1891. The Stove Workers, with 5,800 members, became a Division of the International Brotherhood known as the Stove, Furnace, Energy and Allied Appliance Workers Division. The word energy was inserted to give special recognition to the coal miners within that Division. The Division had its members employed primarily in the manufacturing of stoves and various types of appliances.

During the same period, merger talks were also being carried out with an independent union known as the Western Energy Workers. This one-local union, formed in 1978 with members employed in the coal strip-mining, signed a merger agreement with the Boilermakers effective December 1, 1994.

In October 1996, a merger agreement was made with the Metal Polishers, Buffers, Platers and Allied Workers International Union. This union was also an old line, skill trade union that was organized in 1892. This merger brought 4,000 new members to the Brotherhood. These members are employed primarily in plating and polishing shops within the United States and Canada.

On July 24, 2003, International President Charles W. Jones resigned his office, and the International Executive Council elected Newton B. Jones to complete his unexpired term.

<doc id="312737" title="Oor Wullie" nonfiltered="1107" processed="1092" dbindex="1481117">

Oor Wullie is a Scottish comic strip published in the D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd newspaper The Sunday Post. It features a boy named William ('Wullie' - Oor Wullie is Our Willie in Scots) whose trademarks are spiky hair, dungarees and sitting on an upturned bucket - indeed, the strip has started and ended with a single frame featuring Wullie on his bucket since early 1937. The earliest strips always ended with Wullie complaining 'I nivver get ony fun roond here!' and featured very little dialogue, with the artistic style settling down by 1940 and changing little since. A frequent tag-line reads "Oor Wullie! Your Wullie! A'body's Wullie!".

Created by cartoonist Dudley D. Watkins (1907-1969), the strip first appeared in the issue dated 8 March 1936. Watkins continued to draw it until his death, after which the Sunday Post recycled his work into the 1970s, when he was succeeded by Ken H. Harrison, followed in 1995 by the current artist Peter Davidson.  The storylines are now written by broadcaster Tom Morton, from his home in Shetland.

Wullie's home town is an amalgam of Dundee and Glasgow, unnamed in the Watkins strips, but called Auchenshoogle since the late 1990s. His adventures consist mostly of get-rich-quick schemes and getting up to mischief, to the despair of his parents Ma and Pa (Dave), and the local policeman, P.C. Murdoch. His friends are Fat Boab (Eng: Fat Bob), Wee Eck (Eng: Little Alec), and Soapy Soutar, and he is the leader of their gang, a position which is frequently disputed by the others. He used to have another friend called Ezzy who stopped appearing in the strips, along with Wullie's little brother. He owns a pet mouse named Jeemy, and in later years has gained a Highland Terrier named Harry, and a "sometime-girlfriend", Primrose Patterson. Characters from The Broons occasionally feature, particularly Granpaw.

Wullie's age is indeterminate, but his height has been specified at 4 feet 6 inches tall. His catch phrases consist of "Jings", "Crivvens" and "Help ma Boab".

The Oor Wullie strips are presented in a bi-annual with every other year being given over to The Broons. A series of compilation albums have been published over the years featuring The Broons and Oor Wullie on alternate pages.

William Ross, Baron Ross of Marnock, Secretary of State for Scotland 1964-1970 and 1974-1976, was occasionally depicted in political cartoons seated on a bucket as Oor Wullie.

In March 2006, BBC Scotland documentary Happy Birthday Oor Wullie celebrated the character's 70th anniversary with celebrity guests including Karen Dunbar, Sanjeev Kohli, Kay Adams, Iain Robertson, Tony Roper, Tam Cowan, Stuart Cosgrove, Dominik Diamond and was narrated by Lord of the Rings star Billy Boyd. The programme was made by Angel Eye Media.

The Starkhorn is a snow-clad peak that rises in the inner regions of the White Mountains of J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth. From its feet springs the Snowbourn River, whose widening valley runs northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of Rohan. The Rohirrim called that valley Harrowdale, and built their courts of Edoras at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Starkhorn could be seen along the straight length of the valley.

Sam the Record Man is a Canadian record store chain.

The chain was first launched in 1936 by Sam Sniderman, as a record department in his family's existing radio store in Toronto. In 1961, the store moved out to its own location on Yonge Street, and its location at 347 Yonge Street has become a Toronto landmark. The four story record store located to the site in 1961 and added two spinning record neon signs. The record store also obtained the building at 349 Yonge Street in 1985, formerly Steele's Tavern. This location has been immortalized in the Barenaked Ladies song, Brian Wilson  as the "late night record shop".

The chain subsequently expanded to many other Canadian cities as well, owning 30 stores and franchising the name to 11 others.

In 2001, poor management and tough competition forced the chain to declare bankruptcy and most of its stores closed. The Yonge Street store was reopened in 2002. A store on Barrington Street in Halifax, Nova Scotia also remains open to this day.  Sam The Record Man independent stores still remain in Sarnia and Belleville, Ontario.

The oriental flying gurnard, Dactyloptena orientalis, is a flying gurnard of the family Dactylopteridae found in the Indo-Pacific Oceans at depths down to 100 m.  Their length is up to 40 cm.

The oriental flying gurnard has huge, round pectoral fins.  The fins are usually held against the body, 
but when threatened they can expand the 'wings' to scare off a predator. 

The pelvic fins act like 'legs' as the fish 'walks' along the bottom of the ocean. They also grunt.  Coming from a French term, the word 'gurnard' means to grunt.

The 'wings' have many dark markings and the edge of the fins is a bright blue.  Its body is usually a grayish brown color with dark markings. 

They feed on bony fish, bivalves, and crustaceans.  Predators include 
sea breams and mackerel.

Lake Iamonia is a large prairie lake in northern Leon County, Florida.

Origin of Name.
Lake Iamonia is prounced Ammonia and is named after a Seminole town  Hiamonee,  which was located on the banks of the Ochlockonee River.

Location.
The lake is located in the Red Hills Region and is approximately 5757 acres (23 km²) in size and is 7 miles long and up to 2 miles wide. It has a drainage basin of roughly 101 square miles (260 km). (Wagner and Musgrove, 1983).

Specifics.

Lake Iamonia is classified as Oligotrophic to Mesotrophic. The lake is 95 feet above sea leel and is The Sink Basin, located on the northern shore of Lake Iamonia has a surface area of 19.52 acres at 95 ft, and a maximum depth of 40 feet.

The volume of water in the lake is affected by water in its own drainage basin and by water from the Ochlockonee River and rainfall in Southwestern Georgia. The eastern end of Lake Iamonia is oligotrophic which makes it one of the cleanest lakes in Leon County.

County Road 12 runs along the northern part of the lake. Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy is perched on the north side of the lake. The eastern side comes near US 319, the south side is bordered by the developments of Killearn Lakes Plantation and Luna Pines. The west side comes near State Road 155 (N. Meridian Road).

The lake is surrounded by 4000 acres (16 km²) of land under conservation easement.

In the mid 19th century, Lake Iamonia had Burgesstown Plantation, Pine Hill Plantation, Oaklawn Plantation, and G.W. Holland Plantation surrounding it. During dry periods, plantation owners would graze cattle and sheep on the lake.

Hadès was a French short range, road mobile, solid propellant, single warhead ballistic missile. Hades began with project definition in 1975 as a replacement for the Pluton system. Development started in July 1984, and flight testing started in 1988. The Hades program planned to build 120 missiles, some with nuclear and some with HE warheads. Originally designed with a range of 250 km, the range requirement was later increased to 480 km. Reports in 1993 suggested that a reversion to the 250 km range missile, but with a hard target HE penetration warhead and a GPS mid-course updating of the inertial navigation system, would provide an accurate and difficult to counter offensive weapon system. A TV digital scene matching terminal guidance system has also been proposed, providing a CEP down to less than 5 m.

Hades was designed for transportation on wheeled TELs, with tractor and trailer, each trailer carrying two missiles in containers that also act as launch boxes. The missile is reported to be 7.5 m long, with a body diameter of 0.53 m and a launch weight of about 1850 kg. The missiles will be capable of carrying either the nuclear TN-90 or conventional HE warheads, the former probably having a yield of 80 kT. Reports suggest that the Hades trajectory is kept low, so that the aerodynamic control fins at the rear of the missile can alter the trajectory and range during flight as well as making evasive maneuvres during the terminal phase near the target.

The program completed development in 1992, with the first flight test taking place in 1988. It was planned that Hades would enter service in 1992, and that only 30 missiles on 15 TEL vehicles would be built instead of the original plan to build 120 missiles. In 1991 the French Government announced that the Hades missiles would not be deployed, but kept in storage, and the programme was terminated in 1992. However, 20 to 25 missiles were available in a national emergency with their mobile TEL vehicles, and were all located at Luneville.

On 23 February 1996 the announcement by the President of France on the new format for French nuclear forces called for dismantling of Hadès missiles. On 23 June 1997 the last of the Hadès missile was destroyed.

Richard Lovelace (1618 1659 or 1659)  was an English poet and nobleman, born in Lovelace Place, Bethersden , Kent. He was one of the Cavalier poets, and a noted royalist.  The "Lucasta" to whom he dedicated much of his verse was Lucy Sacheverell, whom he often called Lux Casta.  Unfortunately, she mistakenly believed that he died at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1646 and so married another.  He was imprisoned briefly in 1648 for supporting the Royalists during the time of Oliver Cromwell.  During this period he spent his fortune to help supply Royalist forces, and died in penury shortly thereafter.  His brother then published his poetry posthumously.

His most quoted excerpts are from the beginning of the last stanza of To Althea, From Prison:

Stone walls do not a prison make,Nor iron bars a cage;Minds innocent and quiet takeThat for an hermitage;

and the end of To Lucasta.  Going to the Warres:

I could not love thee, dear, so much,Lov'd I not Honour more.

<doc id="4254379" title="Netherworld (computer game)" nonfiltered="1120" processed="1105" dbindex="1481131">

Netherworld is a shoot 'em up computer game. 

The object is to fly a small spacecraft and collect as many diamonds as possible from the level. Once enough diamonds are collected, the craft must reach a teleporter to go to the next level before the time runs out. Aside of the time limit, there are various obstacles, ranging from monsters to items which can damage the craft or block the path. The ship can destroy some obstacles by shooting, sometimes turning them to diamonds as well. The game thus resembles Boulder Dash, but is quite different.

The game was originally developed by Jukka Tapanimäki for the Commodore 64, and original music was composed by Jori Olkkonen.

The game cover art features Tapanimäki's face. The cover art was done without his knowledge and approval. There was friction between the original cover artist and Tapanimäki; Unbeknownst to him, this led to the art getting shelved and new version was made. Tapanimäki and did not see the final version until the press conference in London where the game was released, giving him a big shock.

Many game magazines published a cheat code that only works in a work-in-progress version; this, along with some published POKEs, allowed to deduce that the game was leaked to pirates some 6 months before the release.

Schefflera actinophylla (syn. Brassaia actinophylla) was named after a 19th century botanist, J.C. Scheffler. Common names include Umbrella Tree and Octopus Tree. It is a flowering plant in the ginseng family Araliaceae, native to rainforests in tropical eastern Queensland and the Northern Territory, Australia, as well as in New Guinea and Java. It is an evergreen tree growing to 15 m (49 ft) tall. It has compound medium green leaves in groups of seven leaves. It is usually multi-trunked, and the flowers develop at the top of the tree. It often develops an epiphytic habit and grows on other rainforest trees. 

Cultivation and uses.
It is commonly grown as a decorative tree in larger gardens and, when mature, it has very showy red blooms with up to 20 racemes which develop in summer or early autumn. Its flowers are favoured by honey-eating birds. 

The fruit are eaten by many birds and animals including Musky Rat Kangaroos, Red-legged Pademelons and Spectacled Flying Foxes. Its leaves  are a favourite food of the Bennett's Tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus bennettianus). 

Propagation.
Fleshy fruits dispersed by birds and bats, or by cuttings.
 
Care.
The bright red spikes of flowers and the fruit make this a popular The plant prefers well-drained soil and only needs occasional water and food to thrive. It is, however, an aggressive plant and its roots can dominate surrounding soil and is, therefore, only recommended for planting in large gardens.

<doc id="8876270" title="Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy" nonfiltered="1124" processed="1109" dbindex="1481135">
Irrational Man subtitled "A Study In Existential Philosophy" is an influential book by William Barrett published in 1958 which served to introduce existentialism to the English speaking world. His writing style is conversational, and he takes time to define terms and give the reader background on philosophical terms and concepts, so this book is aimed at a general reader curious about the topic.

The need for a native English speaker to write a text on existentialist philosophy was paramount for its understanding, since most of the primary philosophers in this movement were not native English speakers. While Kiergegaard's works had been translated several decades earlier, the full impact of existential philosophy had not yet been felt in the English speaking world when this book was produced. Being and Nothingness had been available in English for only a couple of years, Kaufman's Thus Spoke Zarathusra translation had been out only a few more, and Being and Time had not yet been translated into English.

Organization of the book.
In the four parts of the book, Barrett explains in brief the philosophical tradition to which existentialism was a reaction, and then the main concepts of existential thought.

Part one - "The Present Age".
This part shows the impact that existentialism has had on culture even without being a widely known philosophical school of thought.

Part two - Sources of Existentialism.
This part traces the development of philosophy (and is a good overview of the subject) as it pertains to being, ontology, and metaphysics. This serves to show the contrast between existentialist thought and other forms of philosophy.

Part three - The Existentialists.
The four main philosophical thinkers are introduced, along with their primary thoughts and terminology.

 Kierkegaard;
 Nietzsche;
 Heidegger;
 Sarte;

The discussion of each philosopher serves as a road map for those seeking an entre into the primary works of each, which can be dense with unique terminology. (Particularly Heidegger and Sarte.) The material in each of these four sections summarizes the main points each philosopher contributed to existentialism. The reactions of one philosopher to another is also explored. (Again, particularly Heidegger and Sarte.) The philosophers are also situated in the larger history of philosophical investigations outside of existentialism itself.

Barrett concentrates on these main philosophers and avoids an in-depth discussion (although he does mention some) of the many of the existentialist artists, writers, etc.

Part four - Integral vs Rational Man.
This last, short part applies existentialist thought to the world of the late 1950s, during the Cold War.

Appendices .
 Appendix one is "Negation, Finitude, and the Nature of Man" which was a paper presented by the author in 1957.

 Appendix two is a discussion of existentialism and analytic philosophy. (This is not for the general reader.);

The Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex consists of three wilderness areas, all within the U.S. state of Montana totalling over 1.5 million acres (6,100 km²). The largest wilderness area is the Bob Marshall consisting of 1 million acres (4000 km²). Adjoining the Bob Marshall to the north is the Great Bear Wilderness of 286,700 acres (1,160 km²), and to the south of the Bob Marshall is the Scapegoat Wilderness consisting of 239,936 acres (971 km²). 

Located in the northern Rocky Mountains along the Continental Divide, the region is as primitive as any found in the United States outside of Alaska. Although renowned for excellent fishing and backpacking opportunities, most of those that enter the wilderness complex do so on horseback and there are outfitters that provide guided pack trips into the region. The Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is also well known for being prime Grizzly bear habitat, and the population density of this species is higher there than anywhere else in the lower 48 states.

<doc id="95170" title="Pragmatism" nonfiltered="1127" processed="1112" dbindex="1481138">
 



Pragmatism is a school of philosophy that originated with Charles Sanders Peirce (who first stated the pragmatic maxim) and came to fruition in the early twentieth-century philosophies of William James and John Dewey. Most of the thinkers who describe themselves as pragmatists consider practical consequences or real effects to be vital components of both meaning and truth. Other important aspects of pragmatism include a thoroughgoing naturalism and anti-cartesianism, radical empiricism, a combination of metaphysical realism and psychologism sometimes termed instrumentalism, the reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism and last but not least the primacy of practice.
 
Pragmatism flourished at a time when psychology and epistemology weren't considered separate disciplines, and is currently enjoying renewed attention, in part due to the loosened grip of analytic philosophy within academia and the rising popularity of naturalized epistemology.

 Origins .

As a philosophical movement, pragmatism originated in the United States in the late 1800s. The thought and works of Charles Sanders Peirce (IPA: /p s/), William James and John Dewey (all members of The Metaphysical Club) as well as George Herbert Mead figured most prominently in its overall direction. The term pragmatism was first used in print by James, who credited Peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s. Prompted by James' use of the term and its attribution to him, Peirce began writing and lecturing on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation. Peirce eventually coined the new name pragmaticism to mark what he regarded as the original idea, more for clarity's sake than because he disagreed with James. (Menand 2001)

James and Pierce were inspired by several earlier thinkers, notably Alexander Bain, who examined the crucial links among belief, conduct, and disposition by saying that a belief is a proposition on which a person is prepared to act. Earlier thinkers that inspired the pragmatists include David Hume for his naturalistic account of knowledge and action, Thomas Reid for his direct realism, Georg Hegel for his introduction of temporality into philosophy, Francis Bacon who coined the phrase "knowledge is power" and perhaps even the Ancient Sophists for their humanism and attention to informal logic.

 Pragmatist epistemology .
All pragmatist epistemology can be characterized by a broad emphasis on the importance of practical effects: how theoretical ideas affect the human way of life in general and the life of inquiry in particular. Put more formally, pragmatists are committed to an epistemological framework that interrelates causality and agency or rationality.

The epistemology of these early pragmatists was heavily influenced by Darwinian thinking. Pragmatists were not the first to see the relevance of evolution for theories of knowledge: the same rationale had convinced Schopenhauer that we should adopt biological idealism because what's useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is actually true. Pragmatism differs from this idealist account because it challenges the assumption that knowledge and action are two separate spheres, and that there exists an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond the sort of inquiry that organisms use to cope with life. Pragmatism, in short, provides what might be termed an ecological account of knowledge: inquiry is construed as a means by which organisms can get a grip on their environment. 'Real' and 'true' are labels that have a function in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of that context. It is plainly psychologist but also realist: it assumes an external world which must be dealt with.  


A general tendency by philosophers to push all views into either the idealist or realist camp, as well as William James' occasional penchant for eloquence at the expense of public understanding, resulted in the widespread but false characterization of pragmatism as a form of subjectivism or idealism. Many of James' best-turned phrases   "truth's cash value" (James 1907, p. 200) and "the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking" (James 1907, p. 222)   were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as the representing the view that any idea that has practical utility is true. William James writes: 
It is high time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history. Schiller says the true is that which 'works.' Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives 'satisfaction'! He is treated as one who believes in calling everything true which, if it were true, would be pleasant. (James 1907, p. 90) In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle. (See Dewey 1910 for a 'FAQ')

Pragmatists do disagree with the view that beliefs must represent reality to be true - "Copying is one only one genuine mode of knowing" says James (James 1907, p. 91) - and argue that beliefs are dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action. It is only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that theories acquire meaning, and only with a theory's success in this struggle that it becomes true. However most pragmatists do not hold that anything that is practical or useful, or that anything that helps to survive merely in the short-term, should be regarded as true. For example, C.S. Peirce takes the pragmatic theory to imply that theoretical claims should be tied to verification practices   they should be subject to test. Truth is defined, for Peirce, as the ultimate outcome (i.e. not a real point in time) of inquiry by a (usually) scientific community of investigators. In an alternate reading, Dewey characterized truthfulness as a species of the good: to state that something is true means stating that it is trustworthy or reliable and will remain so in every conceivable situation.

 Central pragmatist tenets .
 The primacy of practice .
The action of an organism in its environment is the basic perspective from which the pragmatist proceeds, and our human capability of theorizing is seen as integral to intelligent practice, not on a separate sphere altogether. Theories and distinctions are tools or maps for finding our way in the world. They abstract from our direct experience and ultimately have to "come back to" experience and explain the phenomena that gave rise to the theorizing, so rendering those phenomena more meaningful.

John Dewey noted that there is no question of theory versus practice but rather of intelligent practice versus uninformed, stupid practice. and noted in a conversation with William Pepperell Montague that "His effort had not been to practicalize intelligence but to intellectualize practice". (Quoted in Eldridge 1998, p. 5)

 Anti-reification of concepts and theories .
Dewey, in The Quest For Certainty, criticized what he called The philosophical fallacy: philosophers often take categories (such as the mental and the physical) for granted and because they don't realize that these are merely nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems, get entangled in all sorts of metaphysical and conceptual confusions. David L. Hildebrand sums up the problem: "Perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience." (Hildebrand 2003) Various examples are the "ultimate Being" of Hegelian philosophers, the belief in a "realm of value", the idea that logic, because it abstracts away from concrete thought, has nothing to do at all with thinking, and so on.

 Naturalism and anti-cartesianism .
From the outset, pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with science. One of the problems with idealist and realist philosophy alike was their tendency to see human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp, and they resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by Kant or to vague theories  about "correspondence". Pragmatists critized the former because of its inability to relate meaningfully to the world as we experience it, and the latter because it is a hollow theory that takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact. Pragmatism instead tries to explain, psychologically and biologically, how the relation between knower and known actually works.

Richard Rorty expanded on these arguments in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature where he criticized the attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to - and sometimes thought of as superior to - the empirical sciences.


 The reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism .
Hilary Putnam suggests that the reconciliation of antiskepticism and fallibilism is the central claim of American pragmatism. Peirce insisted  that contrary to Descartes' famous and influential method in the Meditations on First Philosophy, doubt cannot be feigned or created for the purpose of conducting philosophical inquiry. Doubt, like belief, requires justification, that is, it arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (from what Dewey called a 'situation'), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition. Inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter. Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to the modern academic skepsis in the wake of Descartes. The pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is actually quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition.

 Pragmatism in other fields of philosophy .
While pragmatism started out simply as a criterion of meaning, it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field.

 Philosophy of Science .
In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments whose worth is measured not by whether the concepts and theories somehow mirror reality, but by how effective they are in explaining and predicting phenomena. Instrumentalism does not state that truth doesn't matter, but is rather a specific solution to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.

W. V. Quine's paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism, published 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of twentieth century philosophy in the analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central parts of the logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths, explained by Quine as truths grounded only in meanings and independent of facts, and truths grounded in facts. The other is reductionism, which is the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience. Quine's argument brings to mind Peirce's insistence that axioms aren't a priori truths but synthetic statements.

 Logic .
Later in his life Schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook "Formal Logic." By then, Schiller's pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy. Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in an actual context. The criticism of Schiller's book was nicely summarized by him near his death, in an essay entitled "Are All Men Mortal?" The least famous of Schiller's main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book "Formal Logic." In this sequel, "Logic for Use," Schiller attempts to construct a new logic to replace formal logic he has just decimated in "Formal Logic." What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.

Whereas F.C.S. Schiller actually dismissed the possibility of formal logic, most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic rather as one logical tool among others - or perhaps, considering the multitude of formal logics, one set of tools among others. C.S. Peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic. Stephen Toulmin's The Uses of Argument, in essence an epistemological work, inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies.





 Metaphysics .
James and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained. They were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because in the tradition dating from Hume, empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations. To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality. Radical empiricism, or Immediate Empiricism in Dewey's words, wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms.


William James gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming: 
young graduate began by saying that he had always taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic classroom you had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street. The two were supposed, he said, to have so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy your mind with them at the same time. The world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of real life are absent from it.  In point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it  It is no explanation of our concrete universe(James 1907, pp. 8-9)

F.C.S. Schiller's first book, "Riddles of the Sphinx", was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in America. In it, Schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics. The result of the split between these two explanatory schemes that are comparable to what William James called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism, Schiller contends, is that mechanicistic naturalism cannot make sense of the "higher" aspects of our world (freewill, consciousness, purpose, universals and some would add God), while abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the "lower" aspects of our world (the imperfect, change, physicality). While Schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish, he suggests metaphysics as a tool that can aid inquiry and is only valuable insofar as it actually does help in explanation.

In the second half of the twentieth century, Stephen Toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what 'ultimate reality' consists of. More recently, a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytical philosopher Daniel Dennett who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to adopt the intentional stance and acknowledge both the 'syntactical' aspects of reality (i.e. whizzing atoms) and its emergent or 'semantic' properties (i.e. meaning and value).

Radical Empiricism gives interesting answers to questions about the limits of science if there are any, the nature of meaning and value and the workability of reductionism. These questions feature prominently in current debates about the relationship between science and religion, where it is often assumed - most pragmatists would disagree - that science degrades everything that is meaningful into 'merely' physical phenomena.

 Philosophy of Mind .
Both John Dewey in Nature and Experience (1929) and half a century later Richard Rorty in his monumental Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body result from conceptual confusions. They argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an ontological category.



 Ethics .
Pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values. Both facts and values have cognitive content: knowledge is what we should believe, values are hypotheses about what is good in action. Pragmatist ethics is broadly humanist because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans. Its basic idea is pretty straightforward: good values are those for which we have good reasons, viz. the Good Reasons approach. It predates other philosophers that have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as Jerome Schneewind and John Searle.


William James contribution to ethics, as laid out in his essay The Will to Believe has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationalism. More realistically, it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait on adequate proof when making moral decisions.
Moral questions immediately present themselves as questions whose solution cannot wait for sensible proof. A moral  question is a question not of what sensibly exists, but of what is good, or would be good if it did exist.  A social organism of any sort whatever, large or small, is what it is because each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will simultaneously do theirs. Wherever a desired result is achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its existence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in one another of those immediately concerned. A government, an army, a commercial system, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on this condition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but nothing is even attempted. (James 1896)

Of the classical pragmatists, John Dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy. (Edel 1993) In his classic article about the Three Independent Factors in Morals(Dewey 1930) he tried to integrate the three basic perspectives on morality: the right, the virtuous and the good. He holds that all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions and that the possibility of conflict between the three elements exists and cannot always be easily solved. (Anderson, SEP)

Dewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education both conceived as merely a means to an end; and stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education not as a preparation for life but life itself.

Dewey was opposed to other philosophies of his time, notably the emotivism of Alfred Ayer. Dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline, and thought values can be best characterized not as feelings or imperatives, but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed consummatory experience. A further implication of this view is that, because we're not always sure about what we want, or don't always know if what we want is what would really satisfy us, ethics is a fallible undertaking.

 Aesthetics .
John Dewey's Art and Experience, based on the William James lectures he delivered at Harvard, was an attempt to show the integrity of art, culture and everyday experience. (Field, IEP) Art, for Dewey, is or should be a part of everyone's creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists. He also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient. Dewey's treatment of art was a move away from the transcendental approach to aesthetics in the wake of Immanuel Kant who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation.

 Philosophy of Religion .
Both Dewey and James have investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society, the former in A Common Faith and the latter in The Varieties of Religious Experience.

It should be noted, from a general point of view, that for William James, something is true only insofar as it works. Thus, the statement, for example, that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but (a) will not actually help to bring about the things you pray for (b) may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are actually heard. As such, pragmatism isn't antithetical to religion but it isn't an apologetic for faith either.



 Analytical, neoclassical and neopragmatism .
Neopragmatism is a container for various thinkers, some of them radically opposed to each other, such as Richard Rorty and Hilary Putnam. The name is usually taken to mean that the thinkers in question significantly diverge from 'the big three' (Peirce, James, Dewey) either in their philosophical program (many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition) or in thought (C.I. Lewis was very critical of John Dewey). Important analytical thinkers include the aforementioned C.I. Lewis, W.V.O. Quine, Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam and the early work of Richard Rorty. Stanley Fish, the later Rorty and Jürgen Habermas are closer to continental thought.


Neoclassical pragmatism - a handy denominator but not in widespread circulation - denotes those thinkers that stay closer to the project of the classical pragmatists. Sidney Hook and Susan Haack (known for the theory of foundherentism) are probably the most famous ones. Contrary to what the name might suggest, neoclassical pragmatism is everything but conservative.

Not all pragmatists are easily characterized. Point in case is Stephen Toulmin whose thought dovetails nicely with that of the neoclassical pragmatists, but who arrived at it largely independently from either the classical or neoclassical tradition - namely via Wittgenstein who he calls, in retrospect "a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind" (foreword for Dewey 1929 in the 1988 edition, p. xiii) - and who doesn't commonly identify himself as a pragmatist. It is probable, considering the advent of postanalytic philosophy and the diversification of Anglo-American philosophy, that more philosophers will be influenced by pragmatist thought (Daniel Dennett, a student of Quine, is a good example) without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school.

 Contemporary echoes and ties .
In the twentieth century, the movements of logical positivism, behaviorism, functionalism and ordinary language philosophy all have similarities with pragmatism. Like pragmatism, logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics. However, logical positivism doesn't stress action like pragmatism does. Furthermore, the pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense. Usually, pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection.

Ordinary language philosophy is closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between language and world.

Pragmatism has ties to process philosophy. Much of their work developed in dialogue with process philosophers like Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead, who aren't usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points. (Douglas Browning et al. 1998; Rescher, SEP)

 Criticism .
Although many later pragmatists such as W.V.O. Quine were actually analytic philosophers, the most vehement criticisms of classical pragmatism came from within that school of thought. Especially Bertrand Russell was known for his vituperative attacks on what he thought was little more than epistemological relativism and short-sighted practicalism. Realists in general often could not fathom how pragmatists could seriously call themselves empirical or realist thinkers and thought pragmatist epistemology was but a disguised manifestation of idealism. (Hildebrand 2003)

Edmund Husserl criticized psychologism, a critical aspect of pragmatist epistemology, in his The Prolegomena of Pure Logic. Gottlob Frege, an important founder of analytic philosophy, did the same in his The Foundations of Arithmetic. Their criticism is honest  but not decisive: it remains to be seen if indeed "psychology", because of its naturalism, had to miss entirely the accomplishment, the radical and genuine problem, of the life of the spirit" as Husserl claimed in The Vienna Lecture. It need hardly be said that pragmatists insist that the exact opposite is the case.

Pragmatism suffered another kind of depreciation: because of the immense popularity of analytic philosophy and its ahistorical attitude, after their deaths the classical pragmatists were either ignored, forgotten, or caricatured. This is especially the case with Schiller: secondary sources on the work of Schiller are extremely rare, as are his primary works. By some, Schiller is considered one of the philosophers who gave pragmatism a bad name by his over-the-top rhetoric and defense of a crude and unsophisticated form of pragmatism. 

Neopragmatism in the vein of Richard Rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by neoclassical pragmatists such as Susan Haack (Haack 1997) and by many analytic philosophers (Dennett 1998). Rorty's early analytical work, however, differs notably from his later work which some including Rorty himself consider to be closer to literature criticism than to philosophy proper - most criticism is aimed at this latter phase of Rorty's thought.

A list of pragmatists.


Classical pragmatists (1850-1950).
 Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914): was the founder of American pragmatism (later called by Peirce pragmaticism). He wrote on a wide range of topics, from mathematical logic and semeiotics to psychology. ;
 William James (1842-1910): influential psychologist and theorist of religion, as well as philosopher. First to be widely associated with the term "pragmatism" due to Peirce's lifelong unpopularity.
 John Dewey (1859-1952): prominent philosopher of education, referred to his brand of pragmatism as instrumentalism.
 F.C.S. Schiller (1864-1937): one of the most important pragmatists of his time, Schiller is largely forgotten today.

Important protopragmatists or related thinkers
 George Herbert Mead (1863-1931): philosopher and social psychologist.
 Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882): the American protopragmatist.
 Josiah Royce (1855-1916): colleague of James who employed pragmatism in an idealist metaphysical framework, he was particularly interested in the philosophy of religion and community; his work is often associated with neo-Hegelianism.
 George Santayana (1863-1952): often not considered to be a canonical pragmatist, he applied pragmatist methodologies to naturalism (philosophy), exemplified in his early masterwork, The Life of Reason.

Fringe figures
 Giovanni Papini (1881-1956): Italian essayist, mostly known because James occasionally mentioned him.
 Giovanni Vailati (1863-1909): Italian analytic and pragmatist philosopher.

Neoclassical pragmatists (1950-).
Neoclassical pragmatists stay closer to the project of the classical pragmatists than neopragmatists do.

 Sidney Hook (1902-1989): a prominent New York intellectual and philosopher, a student of Dewey at Columbia.
 Isaac Levi (1930): seeks to apply pragmatist thinking in a decision-theoretic perspective.
 Susan Haack (1945): teaches at the University of Miami, sometimes called the intellectual grand-daughter of C.S. Peirce, known chiefly for foundherentism.
 Larry Hickman: philosopher of technology and important Dewey scholar as head of the Center for Dewey Studies.
 David Hildebrand: like other scholars of the classical pragmatists, Hildebrandt is dissatisfied with neopragmatism and argues for the continued importance of the writings of John Dewey.



Analytical, neo- and other pragmatists (1950-).
(Often labelled neopragmatism as well.)

 Willard van Orman Quine (1908-2000): pragmatist philosopher, concerned with language, logic, and philosophy of mathematics.
 Clarence Irving Lewis (1883-1964).
 Richard Rorty: famous author of Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. Whereas his early work is still obviously pragmatist, his later works take on a relativistic bent not shared by most other pragmatists.
 Hilary Putnam: in many ways the opposite of Rorty and thinks classical pragmatism was too permissive a theory.
 Richard Shusterman: philosopher of art.
 Stephen Toulmin: student of Wittgenstein, known especially for his The Uses of Argument.

Other pragmatists.
Legal pragmatists
 Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.: justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
 Stephen Breyer: U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice.
 Richard Posner: Judge on U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
Pragmatists in the extended sense
 Cornel West: thinker on race, politics, and religion; operates under the sign of "prophetic pragmatism".
 Wilfrid Sellars: broad thinker, attacked foundationalism in the analytic tradition.
 Frank P. Ramsey;
 Karl-Otto Apel;
 Nicholas Rescher;

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 is a class of steam locomotive designed for light mixed traffic.

Overview.
Elderly 0-6-0s formed the backbone of the low-powered LMS locomotive fleet. William Stanier had concentrated on introducing larger engines and it was left to George Ivatt to introduce a new class of medium-powered locomotive.  He designed a tender version of the Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T, introduced at the same time, which was based on the Great Western 4500 and 4575 classes.  While the 2-6-2Ts were less than successful, the 2-6-0s were well-suited to their task and quickly became a success. Along with the BR standard class 2 2-6-0, these locomotives are often referred to by the nickname "Mickey Mouse".

A total of 218 were built between 1946 and 1953, mostly at Crewe.  20 were built by LMS and given the numbers 6400-19.  On nationalisation in 1948 40000 was added to their numbers to become 46400-19.  The remaining 108 locomotives of the class, numbered 46420-46527 were built by British Railways to a slightly modified design with a slightly cut-down cab and BR standard fittings.  The LMS classified them 2F, BR as 2MT.  18 were built at Doncaster and allocated to the Eastern and North Eastern regions.  25 were built at Swindon and allocated to the Western Region.  The Swindon locomotives were turned out in lined green, the rest carried black livery.  None of them was named. 



The class was withdrawn between 1961 and 1967.

Preservation.
Seven have been preserved.  These are 46428, 46441, 46443, 46447, 46464, 46512 and 46521.  46512 and 46521 were built at Swindon and 46521 carries the BR green livery.  46441 has been given an inauthentic livery of "what might have been" had the LMS not been nationalised; it has been renumbered 6441 and painted in LMS passenger crimson lake livery. Details in preservation are as follows:

Chicago Story was an NBC drama that aired in the spring of 1982.  The series followed
the work and lives of several Chicago lawyers, police officers, and doctors.  The series was
similar to Hill Street Blues in that it was less about action scenes and more about
the stresses of working in law enforcement and medicine.  The show did not catch on with
viewers and lasted only thirteen episodes.



Chicago Story was notable for attempting to air an hour and a half per episode.
The show was pared down to an hour per episode late in its run, including broadcasting
edited versions of episodes that had already aired.

The Guyana Agricultural and General Workers' Union (GAWU) is the largest trade union in Guyana. It was founded in 1946 as the Guiana Industrial Workers' Union. After failing in the 1950s it was reformed as the Guyana Sugar Workers' Union in 1961, but changed its name to Guyana Agricultural Workers' Union in 1962 before becoming the GAWU later that decade.

The GAWU is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Walter Jakob Gehring (born March 20, 1939 in Zurich) is Professor at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, Switzerland. He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Zurich in 1965 and after two years as a research assistant of Professor Ernst Hadorn he joined Professor Alan Garen's group at Yale University in New Haven as a postdoctoral fellow.

In 1969 he was appointed as an associate professor at the Yale Medical School and 1972 he returned to Switzerland to become a professor of developmental biology and genetics at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel. He is Secretary General of the European Molecular Biology Organization, President of the International Society for Developmental Biologists, a Foreign Member of the National Academy of the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany and Sweden. In 2000 he received the Kyoto Prize for Basic Science.

Walter Gehring has mainly been involved in studies of Drosophila genetics and development, particularly in the analysis of cell determination in the embryo and transdetermination of imaginal discs. He has made significant contributions to the study of the heat shock genes, various transposons and the homeotic genes which are involved in the genetic control of development.

He and his group have discovered the homeobox, a DNA segment characteristic for homeotic genes which is not only present in arthropods and their ancestors, but also in vertebrates up to man. He has been involved in the development and application of enhancer trapping methods. He and his collaborators have identified PAX6 as a master control gene for eye development, which led to a new theory about the monophyletic origin of the eyes in evolution.

Harper Park Middle School is a public secondary school in Leesburg, Virginia, in the Potomac Station community. It was founded in 1999.  Students from Cool Spring Elementary School and John Tolbert Elementary School feed into Harper Park.

History.
1999-2001.
Harper Park opened in a time of explosive growth in the Leesburg area.  It originally served as the feeder middle school for Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn, Virginia.  During its first two years of operation, most Harper Park students did not live in Leesburg.  In the 2000-2001 school year when Stone Bridge opened, Harper Park 8th graders were housed at Stone Bridge along with the 9th, 10th and 11th graders due to crowding at Harper Park, which had an estimated 1,500 students.

2001 to present.
In the 2001-2002 school year, Eagle Ridge Middle School opened in Ashburn, which removed over half of the student body, but students from the southeastern part of Leesburg were fed into Harper Park, which was then designated as the middle school for Heritage High School as Eagle Ridge fed into Stone Bridge.  This move was very controversial because Heritage is nearly across the street from J. Lupton Simpson Middle School, which fed (and still feeds into) Loudoun County High School.  The boundary lines are drawn to the point where students who live on houses across the street from Heritage High School attend Simpson which is also across the street, but interestingly attend Loudoun County High instead of Heritage later on.  Though Harper Park was for a time considered to be the feeder middle school for Loudoun County High, it was abandoned because of backlash from parents in the Potomac Station and River Creek subdivisions, who wanted their children to attend brand new schools, and also because they did not want to return children to the same high school cluster where they were before Stone Bridge opened.

In 2004, Smart's Mill Middle School opened in the northern part of Leesburg, and took Harper Park students from the Leesburg Elementary and the Ball's Bluff Elementary zones, who continue to feed into Heritage despite the middle school change.  Smart's Mill also took students from Lucketts Elementary in northern Leesburg, whose students feed into Loudoun County High even after the school's opening.

Future Changes.
A new Leesburg high school is expected to open in 2009 near Smart's Mill, when considerable boundary changes are likely to happen.  After the high school opens, Simpson Middle School students will feed into Heritage High School; Smart's Mill will probably feed into the new high school, and Harper Park is expected to feed into Loudoun County.

The Psion Series 5 is a PDA from Psion.  It comes in two main variants, the Series 5 (launched in 1997) and the Series 5mx (1999), the latter having a faster processor, clearer screen, and updated software.  There is also a rare Series 5mx Pro, which differs only in having the operating system loaded into RAM and hence upgradable. Ericsson marketed a rebadged version of the Series 5mx called the MC218.

The Psion Series 5 is a major upgrade from the Psion Series 3.  A Psion Series 4 does not exist, due to Psion's concern of tetraphobia in their Asian markets.  The external appearance of the Psion Series 5 and the Psion Series 5mx are broadly similar, but their mainboards and other internal components are different and not interchangeable.  The screens are not interchangeable because of different screen cables.

They have a clam-shell design, the keyboard sliding forward to counterbalance the touchscreen.  The moving parts and hinges can wear out or break.  The most serious common problem arises because of a design fault in the screen cable where tooling holes cause unnecessary stressing due to additional bending of the cable at this point each time the Psion Series 5 is opened or closed and eventually leading to failure of the cable, which causes a serious display malfunction and the appearance of vertical lines on the screen.  The screen cable to the Psion Series 5 is more durable than the screen cable of the Psion Series 5mx.  There is an after-market cable available for the 5mx which eliminates this problem.

At the heart is a 32-bit RISC-based ARM710T processor running at 18MHz (Series 5) or 36MHz (5mx), with 4, 8 or 16MB of RAM.  It's powered by two AA batteries, typically giving 10 - 20 hours of use.  The display is a touch-sensitive, backlit half-VGA (640x240-pixel) LCD with 16 greyscales.  The keyboard is one of the best for its size, with large-travel keys and touch-type capability. Both RS-232 and IrDA (infra-red) serial connections are provided, along with a speaker and microphone, giving dictation ability as well as playing music. External storage is on CompactFlash.



The EPOC operating system, later known as Symbian OS, is built-in, along with applications for word processing, spreadsheets, databases, email, contact and diary management, and software development using Psion's own OPL language.  A Java Virtual Machine and synchronisation software for Windows was bundled with the 5mx as optional installations and, later on, the 'Executive Edition' of the 5mx was bundled with various hardware and software extras including version 3.62 of the Opera web browser and a mains adaptor.  A wealth of third-party software is also available, from games and utilities to navigation, reference, communications, and productivity applications, and standard programming tools like Perl and Python.

It can also run Linux to some extent: see the OpenPsion site.

Psion's experience designing for this form factor and attention to detail has made these machines a favourite with power users, many of whom have stuck with them, despite their age and the appearance of Symbian OS-powered mobile phones and other PDAs with more impressive-sounding specifications. There have been intermittent rumours of Psion's return to the consumer market, but the Series 5mx would seem to be their swansong.

Game over is the ending text of many video games.  Notably used in pinball machines and later arcade games, it has since been adopted widely and is now commonly associated with video games in general.

History.
Early.
The phrase was used at the end of games, whether the player has won the game or not.  Early devices such as electromechanical pinball machines would light up the phrase with a lamp (lightbulb).  This usage was carried over into arcade games.  Early video arcade games such as Space Invaders have the phrase "Game Over" simply superimposed on the screen, while more recent games usually have a separate Game Over screen.

Some arcade games additionally used the "Game Over" not only to indicate the end of the game, but also to signify that the game was not currently being played; a flashing "Game Over" would appear over a demo of the game to indicate that it was not in use. 

Modern.
The usage of "Game Over" varies.  Most games of today have dropped the usage of "Game Over" for a successful completion of the game, and instead use other ending texts such as "The End" or an outro and credits sequence.  "Game Over" is then only used to signify failure, though some series continue to use the phrase for all endings.

With the advance of computing power, modern Game Over screens tend to be more elaborate than mere flashing text.  The phrase may be animated and accompanied by graphics.  Furthermore, many modern games don't actually use "Game Over" as the failing ending text.  For example, the Resident Evil series uses the ending text "You Are Dead" or "You Died," in a font that resembles bloody slashes. Mortal Kombat 4 contains a gory Game Over sequence in which the beaten fighter falls down a chasm into a spike pit if they run out of credits or choose not to continue.  Many other variant texts exist, from "Mission Failed" to "Your adventure has ended," to "Good night!" to "Dead End!"to "You Lose."

Occasionally, the screen contains no text at all, but merely a picture, as in Dracula or Duke Nukem: Time to Kill.  The phrase can also be spoken by someone off-screen as the scores are shown, such as in the  series, or by the head of one of the antagonist characters, as in Crash Bandicoot 2 and Crash Bandicoot: Warped.

"Bad" endings.

A "Game Over" is not necessarily the same thing as a bad ending. A bad ending occurs when the player finishes the game but is not completely successful for some reason.  Bad endings are usually ending branches where the player has chosen poorly or otherwise failed some task.  For example, the main character agrees to join the villain and rule together; the damsel in distress is not freed; or the curse afflicting a character is not broken, and that character is dead in the ending.  These endings usually have their own unique screens and results distinct from a standard "death."

Twists on usage.
As games have matured, new twists have been found to keep Game Over sequences unique.  In Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, for instance, the game is related as a story being narrated by the Prince. If the Prince or Farah dies, the Prince stumbles a bit and says "No, wait, that didn't happen. May I start again?" or "No, no, she didn't die. I defeated those monsters and moved on. Shall I restart?"  The Metal Gear series is particularly notorious for breaking the fourth wall, and has exploited the Game Over screen in game events.  In Metal Gear Solid 2, several bizarre events occur, one of which is the sudden switch to the Mission Failed screen, except that the phrase "Fission Mailed" is in the corner, with the gameplay continuing in the small window that normally shows the main character's dead body. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater continues this tradition with a "fake death pill" that, when taken, shows the Game Over screen (though the player can still access items and revive themselves). Also, if you happen to wait long enough on the Game Over screen, the letter change and re-arrange to read "Time paradox", a reference to the fact the game is a prequel to the previous Metal Gear Solid games; the events in the games would not have happened if the main character actually died at this point.

Cultural influences.
The usage of the words "Game Over" in English certainly predates even pinball machines.  However, modern usage outside of gaming usually at least references the "end of a computer/video game" meaning.  It is sometimes used to signify an abrupt (and nasty) end, similar to the one a player might meet in such a video game. In the 1986 film Aliens, Bill Paxton's character Hudson uses the phrase to indicate what he thinks is a hopeless situation: "... Game over, man! Game over!"  This phrase, shortened to "Game over, man!", was later used as part of the Game Over screen of the SNES game Alien³, based on the film of the same name.  In the 2004 film Saw, the film concludes with Tobin Bell's character locking Leigh Whannell's in a bathroom to die and saying "Game over."  Japanese "Pink film" director Hisayasu Sato often concludes his films abruptly with the use of the legend GAME OVER and a surge of white noise, emphasizing the ambiguous nature of the reality of his films.

WWE wrestler Triple H (who calls himself "The Game") often uses the phrase "Game Over" in his promos.  He also has a shirt that on the front says "Game Over?!", with the back continuing the phrase with "You're Damn Right I'm Over!"

The Los Angeles Dodgers closer Éric Gagné is associated with the phrase "Game Over" as a gimmick; when entering a game during the 8th or 9th inning, scoreboards flash "Game Over!"  The team sells merchandise with this phrase as well, in reference to Gagné.

A flashing Game Over message was displayed after the end credits of the British gaming television series Gamesmaster.

<doc id="667349" title="Dynamic Systems Development Method" nonfiltered="1141" processed="1126" dbindex="1481152">


"Dynamic Systems Development Method" (DSDM) is a framework originally based upon Rapid Application Development (RAD). DSDM utilizes continuous user involvement in an iterative development and incremental approach, which is responsive to changing requirements, to develop a software system that satisfies the business requirements on time and on budget. DSDM is one of a number of Agile methods for developing software, and it forms a part of the Agile Alliance.

DSDM was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1990s by the DSDM Consortium of vendors and experts in the field of Information System (IS) development by combining their best-practice experiences. The DSDM Consortium is a non-profit, vendor independent organisation which owns and administers the framework. The first version was completed in January 1995 and was published in February 1995. The current version in use as of April 2006 is Version 4.2: Framework for Business Centered Development released in May 2003.   

DSDM Public Version 4.2 (www.dsdm.org) was made available for individuals to view and use in July 2006. However, anyone reselling DSDM must still be a member of the not-for-profit consortium.     

As an extension of rapid application development, DSDM focuses on Information Systems projects that are characterized by tight schedules and budgets. DSDM addresses the common reasons for 
information systems project failure including exceeding budgets, missing deadlines, and lack of user involvement and top management commitment.

DSDM consists of 3 phases: pre-project phase, project life-cycle phase, and post project phase. The project life-cycle phase is subdivided into 5 stages: feasibility study, business study, functional model iteration, design and build iteration, and implementation.

DSDM recognizes that projects are limited by time and resources, and plans accordingly to meet the business needs. In order to achieve these goals, DSDM encourages the use of RAD with the consequent danger that too many corners are cut. DSDM applies some principles, roles, and techniques.

In some circumstances, there are possibilities to integrate practices from other methodologies, such as Rational Unified Process (RUP), Extreme Programming (XP), and PRINCE2, as complements to DSDM. Another agile method that has some similarity in process and concept to DSDM is Scrum.

Principles of DSDM.
There are 9 underlying principles of DSDM consisting of four foundations and five starting-points for the structure of the method. These principles form the cornerstones of development using DSDM.
 User involvement is the main key in running an efficient and effective project, where both users and developers share a workplace, so that the decisions can be made accurately.
 The project team must be empowered to make decisions that are important to the progress of the project, without waiting for higher-level approval.
 DSDM focuses on frequent delivery of products, with assumption that to deliver something "good enough" earlier is always better than to deliver everything "perfectly" in the end. By delivering product frequently from an early stage of the project, the product can be tested and reviewed where the test record and review document can be taken into account at the next iteration or phase.
 The main criteria for acceptance of deliverable in DSDM is on delivering a system that addresses the current business needs. It is not so much directed at delivering a perfect system addressing all possible business needs, but focuses its efforts on critical functionality.
 Development is iterative and incremental, driven by users  feedback to converge on an effective business solution.
 All changes during the development are reversible.
 The high level scope and requirements should be base-lined before the project starts.
 Testing is carried out throughout the project life-cycle. (See Test-driven development for comparison).
 Communication and cooperation among all project stakeholders is required to be efficient and effective.

DSDM is also supported by some other principles (or so called assumptions).
 No system is built perfectly in the first try (the pareto principle-80/20 rule). In the process of developing an information system, 80% of the business benefit comes from 20% of the system requirements, therefore DSDM starts implementing this first 20% of system requirements to meet 80% of the business needs, which is good enough as long as the users are intimately involved in the development process and in a position to ensure that the missing 20% would not cause any serious business consequences. Implementing the entire requirements often causes the project to go over deadlines and budgets, therefore it is most times unnecessary to construct the perfect solution.
 Project delivery should be on time, on budget and with good quality.
 DSDM only requires each step of the development to be completed far enough for the next step to begin. This way a new iteration of the project can commence without having to wait for the previous to be completed entirely. And with every iteration the system is improved incrementally. Recall that the business requirements are changing over time at any rate.
 Both Project Management and Development techniques are incorporated in DSDM.
 DSDM can also be used in both new projects and for expanding current systems.
 Risk assessment should focus on business function being delivered, not on the construction process nor on development process artifacts (such as requirements and design documents).
 Management rewards product delivery rather than task completion.
 Estimation should be based on business functionality instead of lines of code.

 Prerequisites for using DSDM.
In order for DSDM to be a success, a number of prerequisites need to be realized. First, there needs to be interactivity between the project team, future end users and higher management. This addresses well known failures of IS development projects due to lack of top management motivation and/or user involvement.

The second important prerequisite for DSDM projects is the decomposability of the project. The possibility of decomposition into smaller parts enables the iterative approach, and activities that are hard to prioritize often cause delays--exactly the effect that DSDM was developed to avoid.  Another group of projects for which DSDM is not well-suited are safety-critical ones. The extensive testing and validation found in these kinds of projects conflict with DSDM goals of being on time and on budget. Finally, projects that aim at re-usable components might not be well-suited for development using DSDM, because the demands on perfection are too high and conflict with the 80%/20% principle described earlier.

 Process-Data Diagram of DSDM Project Life-cycle .

Below is the process-data diagram of DSDM as a whole with all of its 5 stages. This diagram depicts the DSDM iterative development, started on functional model iteration, design and build iteration, and implementation phase. The description of each stage will be explained later in this entry.





The Phases of DSDM .
The DSDM framework consists of three sequential phases, namely the pre-project, project life-cycle and post-project phases. The project phase of DSDM is the most elaborate of the three phases. The project life-cycle phase consists of 5 stages that form an iterative step-by-step approach in developing an IS. The three phases and corresponding stages are explained extensively in the subsequent sections. For each stage/phase, the most important activities are addressed and the deliverables are mentioned.

Phase 1: The Pre-Project.
In the pre-project phase candidate projects are identified, project funding is realized and project commitment is ensured. Handling these issues at an early stage avoids problems at later stages of the project.



Phase 2: The Project life-cycle.
The process overview in the figure above shows the project life-cycle of this phase of DSDM. It depicts the 5 stages a project will have to go through to create an IS. The first two stages, the Feasibility Study and Business Study are sequential phases that complement to each other. After these phases have been concluded, the system is developed iteratively and incrementally in the Functional Model Iteration, Design & Build Iteration and Implementation stages. The iterative and incremental nature of DSDM will be addressed further in a later section.

Stage 1: The Feasibility Study.
During this stage of the project, the feasibility of the project for the use of DSDM is examined. Prerequisites for the use of DSDM are addressed by answering questions like;  Can this project meet the required business needs? ,  Is this project suited for the use of DSDM?  and  What are the most important risks involved? . The most important techniques used in this phase are the Workshops
The deliverables for this stage are the Feasibility Report and the Feasibility Prototype that address the feasibility of the project at hand. It is extended with a global Outline Plan for the rest of the project and a Risk Log that identifies the most important risks for the project.
		
 Stage 2: The Business Study.
The business study extends the feasibility study. After the project has been deemed feasible for the use of DSDM, this stage examines the influenced business processes, user groups involved and their respective needs and wishes. Again the workshops is one of the most valuable techniques, workshops in which the different stakeholders come together to discuss the proposed system. The information from these sessions is combined into a requirements list. An important property of the requirements list is the fact that the requirements are (can be) prioritized. These requirements are prioritized using the MoSCoW approach. Based on this prioritization, a development plan is constructed as a guideline for the rest of the project. An important project technique used in the development of this plan is timeboxing. This technique is essential in realizing the goals of DSDM, namely being on time and on budget, guaranteeing the desired quality. A system architecture is another aid to guide the development of the IS.

The deliverables for this stage are a business area definition that describes the context of the project within the company, a system architecture definition that provides an initial global architecture of the IS under development together with a development plan that outlines the most important steps in the development process. At the base of these last two documents there is the prioritized requirements list. This list states all the requirements for the system, organized according to the MoSCoW principle. And last the Risk Log is updated with the facts that have been identified during this phase of DSDM.

Stage 3: Functional Model Iteration.
The requirements that have been identified in the previous stages are converted to a functional model. This model consists of both a functioning prototype and models. Prototyping is one of the key project techniques within this stage that helps to realize good user involvement throughout the project.
The developed prototype is reviewed by different user groups. In order to assure quality, testing is implemented throughout every iteration of DSDM. An important part of testing is realized in the Functional Model Iteration. The Functional Model can be subdivided into four sub-stages:
 Identify Functional Prototype: Determine the functionalities to be implemented in the prototype that results from this iteration.
 Agree Schedule: Agree on how and when to develop these functionalities.
 Create Functional Prototype: Develop the prototype. Investigate, refine, and consolidate it with the combined Functional prototype of previous iterations.
 Review Prototype: Check the correctness of the developed prototype. This can be done via testing by end-user, then use the test records and user s feedbacks to generate the functional prototyping review document.

The deliverables for this stage are a Functional Model and a Functional Prototype that together represent the functionalities that could be realized in this iteration, ready for testing by users. Next to this, the Requirements List is updated, deleting the items that have been realized and rethinking the prioritization of the remaining requirements. The Risk Log is also updated by having risk analysis of further development after reviewing the prototyping document.

Meta-data Model of Functional Model Iteration.
The associations between concepts of deliverables in Functional Model Iteration stage are depicted in the meta-data model below. This meta-data model will be combined with the meta-process diagram of Functional Model Iteration phase in the next part. 



Process-data Diagram of Functional Model Iteration.
Identify functional prototype activity is to identify the functionalities that would be in the prototype of current iteration. Recall that both, analysis and coding are done; prototypes are built, and the experiences gained from them are used in improving the analysis models (based also on updated prioritized requirements list and updated risk log). The built prototypes are not to be entirely discarded, but gradually steered towards such quality that they can be included in the final system. Agree schedule is to determine when and how the prototyping will be implemented; it extends the scope to the available timetable and prototyping plan. And since testing is implemented throughout the whole process, it s also an essential part of this phase, and therefore it is included in the Review Prototype activity right after the functional prototype is built and the test record will eventually be used in the review prototype process and generates the review document. Below is the process-data diagram of Functional Model Iteration stage. 



Stage 4: Design and Build Iteration.
The main focus of this DSDM iteration is to integrate the functional components from the previous phase into one system that satisfies user needs. It also addresses the non-functional requirements that have been set for the IS. Again testing is an important ongoing activity in this stage. The Design and Build Iteration can be subdivided into four sub-stages:
 Identify Design Prototype: Identify functional and non-functional requirements that need to be in the tested system.
 Agree Schedule: Agree on how and when to realize these requirements.
 Create Design Prototype: Create a system that can safely be handed to end-users for daily use. They investigate, refine, and consolidate the prototype of current iteration within prototyping process are also important in this sub-stage.
 Review Design Prototype: Check the correctness of the designed system. Again testing and reviewing are the main techniques used, since the test records and user s feedbacks are important to generate the user documentation.

The deliverables for this stage are a Design Prototype during the phase that end users get to test and at the end of the Design and Build Iteration the Tested System is handed over to the next phase. In this stage, the system is mainly built where the design and functions are consolidated and integrated in a prototype. Another deliverable for this stage is a User Documentation.

Stage 5: Implementation.
In the Implementation stage, the tested system including user documentation is delivered to the users and training of future users is realized. The system to be delivered has been reviewed to include the requirements that have been set in the beginning stages of the project. The Implementation stage can be subdivided into four sub-stages:
 User Approval and Guidelines: End users approve the tested system for implementation and guidelines with respect to the implementation and use of the system are created.
 Train Users: Train future end user in the use of the system.
 Implement: Implement the tested system at the location of the end users.
 Review Business: Review the impact of the implemented system on the business, a central issue will be whether the system meets the goals set at the beginning of the project. Depending on this the project goes to the next phase, the post-project or loops back to one of the preceding phases for further development. ;

The deliverables for this stage are a Delivered System on location, ready for use by the end users, Trained Users and detailed Project Review Document of the system. 

Phase 3: Post-project.
The post-project phase ensures the system operating effectively and efficiently. This is realized by maintenance, enhancements and fixes according to DSDM principles. The maintenance can be viewed as continuing development based on the iterative and incremental nature of DSDM. Instead of finishing the project in one cycle usually the project can return to the previous phases or stages so that the previous step and the deliverable products can be refined.

Core Techniques of DSDM.
 Timeboxing Timeboxing is one of the project techniques of DSDM. It is used to support the main goals of DSDM to realize the development of an IS on time, within budget and with the desired quality. The main idea behind timeboxing is to split up the project in portions, each with a fixed budget and a delivery date. For each portion a number of requirements are selected that are prioritized according to the MoSCoW principle. Because time and budget are fixed, the only remaining variables are the requirements. So if a project is running out of time or money the requirements with the lowest priority are omitted. This does not mean that an unfinished product is delivered, because of the pareto principle that 80% of the project comes from 20% of the system requirements, so as long as those most important 20% of requirements are implemented into the system, the system therefore meets the business needs and that no system is built perfectly in the first try.
  MoSCoW MoSCoW represents a way of prioritizing items. In the context of DSDM the MoSCoW technique is used to prioritize requirements. It is an acronym that stands for:
 MUST have this requirement to meet the business needs.
 SHOULD have this requirement if at all possible, but the project success does not rely on this.
 COULD have this requirement if it does not affect the fitness of business needs of the project.
 WOULD have this requirement at later date if there is some time left (or in the future development of the system).;
 (An elaborate explanation of the MoSCoW principle can be found here.);
 Prototyping This technique refers to the creation of prototypes of the system under development at an early stage of the project. It enables the early discovery of shortcomings in the system and allows future users to  test-drive  the system. This way good user involvement is realized, one of the key success factors of DSDM, or any System Development project for that matter.
 Testing A third important aspect of the goal of DSDM is the creation of an IS with good quality. In order to realize a solution of good quality, DSDM advocates testing throughout each iteration. Since DSDM is a tool and technique independent method, the project team is free to choose its own test management method, for example TMap.
 Workshop One of DSDM s project techniques that aims at bringing the different stakeholders of the project together to discuss requirements, functionalities and mutual understanding. In a workshop the stakeholders come together and discuss the project.
 Modelling This technique is essential and purposely used to visualise the diagrammatic representation of a specific aspect of the system or business area that is being developed. Modelling gives a better understanding for DSDM project team over a business domain.
 Configuration Management A good implementation of this configuration management technique is important for the dynamic nature of DSDM. Since there is more than one thing being handled at once during the development process of the system, and the products are being delivered frequently at a very fast rate, the products therefore need to be controlled strictly as they achieve (partial) completion.

Roles of DSDM.
There are some roles introduced within DSDM environment. It is important that the project members need to be appointed to different roles before they start to run the project. Each role has its own responsibility. The roles are:
 Executive Sponsor So called the  Project Champion . An important role from the user organization who has the ability and responsibility to commit appropriate funds and resources. This role has an ultimate power to make decisions.
 Visionary The one who has the responsibility to initialize the project by ensuring that essential requirements are found early on. Visionary has the most accurate perception of the business objectives of the system and the project. Another task is to supervise and keep the development process in the right track.
 Ambassador User Brings the knowledge of user community into the project, ensures that the developers receive enough amount of user s feedbacks during the development process.
 Advisor User Can be any user that represents an important viewpoint and brings the daily knowledge of the project.
 Project Manager Can be anyone from user community or IT staff who manages the project in general.
 Technical Co-ordinator Responsible in designing the system architecture and control the technical quality in the project.
 Team Leader Leads his team and ensures that the team works effectively as a whole.
 Developer Interprete the system requirements and model it including developing the deliverablecodes and build the prototypes.
 Tester Checks the correctness in a technical extents by performing some testings. Tester will have to give some comments and documentation.
 Scribe Responsible to gather and record the requirements, agreements, and decisions made in every workshop.
 Facilitator Responsible in managing the workshops progress, acts as a motor for preparation and communication.
 Specialist Roles Business Architect, Quality Manager, System Integrator, etc.

Iterative and Incremental Nature.
Next to timeboxing and prioritizing of requirements, the DSDM also provides an iterative and incremental approach to IS development. This can be seen in the figure depicting the Process Overview above. The Functional Model Iteration, Design & Build Iteration and Implementation stages are all depicted in an iterative manner that shows that each of these stages can go over the different sub stages several times before entering the next stage. Every iteration addressing a set of new functionalities. Thanks to the incremental development approach every iteration is build on a functioning predecessor.  And each increment can be turned back when/if needed.
Next to this property, the figure also shows arrows going back to previous stages. For example, there is an arrow going back from Implementation to the Business Study. If a big functionality has been discovered during development that couldn t be implemented, it might be possible to start all over by defining new requirements in a Business Study. Another example of stepping back to a previous stage is the arrow from Implementation to the Functional Model Iteration. This could be the case when functionality had to be omitted during the previous Functional Model Iteration, because of time and/or budget constraints. Only when all the requirements, needed to realize the set project and business goals, are met will the project proceed into the post-project phase. Because of the iterative nature of DSDM, it is essential to maintain good requirements management and configuration management in place throughout the entire project. This ensures that the project does implement the desired requirements in the desired fashion as was decided in the early phases of the project.

Critical Success Factors of DSDM.
Within DSDM a number of factors are identified as being of great importance to ensure successful projects. 

 Factor 1: First there is the acceptance of DSDM by senior management and other employees. This ensures that the different actors of the project are motivated from the start and remain involved throughout the project. ;

 Factor 2: The second factor follows directly from this and that is the commitment of management to ensure end-user involvement. The prototyping approach requires a strong and dedicated involvement by end user to test and judge the functional prototypes. ;

 Factor 3: Then there is the project team. This team has to be composed of skillful members that form a stable union. An important issue is the empowerment of the project team. This means that the team (or one or more of its members) has to posses the power and possibility to make important decisions regarding the project without having to write formal proposals to higher management, which can be very time-consuming.  In order for the project team to be able to run a successful project, they also need the right technology to conduct the project. This means a development environment, project management tools, etc. ;

 Factor 4: Finally DSDM also states that a supportive relationship between customer and vendor is required. This goes for both projects that are realized internally within companies or by outside contractors. An aid in ensuring a supporting relationship could be ISPL.

Meta-model (Meta-Modeling).

As explained in the Wikipedia item, Meta-Modeling takes a higher level look at methods and techniques. In doing so it offers possibilities for comparing similar methods and techniques and engineering new methods from existing ones.

The Meta data model, depicted below, identifies the concepts and associations between these concepts within DSDM. As can be seen from the figure, two main concepts can be identified, namely the Phase and the Flow concept. Each Flow originates from a Phase within DSDM. Flows can be divided up in the sub concepts Data and Product. This subdivision is denoted with a C, which means that the subdivision is disjoint and complete. In other words, a Flow is always either a Data Flow or a Product Flow, but never both. In the situation of DSDM a Data Flow can be an arc returning to one of the preceding phases. Product Flows are tangible goods that result from one of the Phases and are the input of the next Phase, for example reports and prototypes.

Then there is the second concept Phase that is also be divided two sub concepts with a complete and disjoint ordering. These sub concepts are the Sequential and the Iterative Phases. As was explained in an earlier section, DSDM starts with two sequential phases, The Feasibility and Business Study. Next a number of Iterative phases follow, i.e. Functional Model, Design & Build and Implementation phases.
The picture also mentions a number of rules and issues that are not included in the model, but that are important for this meta-model. First there are the rules that concerns the behavior of the   Flows  . These rules restrict the freedom of the flows so that they correspond to the   Phase   transitions within DSDM. Next to the rules a number of important issues are addressed that ensure that the DSDM project life-cycle is guaranteed.

Comparison to other IS Development Methods.
Over the years a great number of Information System Development methods have been developed and applied, divided in Structured Methods, RAD methods and Object-Oriented Methods. Many of these methods show similarities to each other and also to DSDM. For example eXtreme Programming, XP also has an iterative approach to IS development with extensive user involvement.

The Rational Unified Process is a method that probably has the most in common with DSDM in that it is also a dynamic form of Information System Development. Again the iterative approach is used in this development method.

Like XP and RUP there are many other development methods that show similarities to DSDM, but DSDM does distinguish itself from these methods in a number of ways. First there is the fact that it provides a tool and technique independent framework. This allows users to fill in the specific steps of the process with their own techniques and software aids of choice. Another unique feature is the fact that the variables in the development are not time/resources, but the requirements. This approach ensures the main goals of DSDM, namely to stay within the deadline and the budget. And last there is the strong focus on communication between and the involvement of all the stakeholders in the system. Although this is addressed in other methods, DSDM strongly believes in commitment to the project to ensure a successful outcome.

This last paragraph is largely incorrect, most of RUP can be applied without rational tools and XP does not require any particular tools. XP shares many similarities with DSDM, notably the 'embrace change' philosophy which means requirements 
can be changed as well as time and resources.

<doc id="8092892" title="Wimbledon Effect" nonfiltered="1143" processed="1128" dbindex="1481154">
The Wimbledon Effect is a chiefly British and Japanese analogy (which possibly originated in Japan) which compares the tennis fame of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London with the economic success of the United Kingdom's financial services industries - especially those clustered in the City of London. 

The point of the analogy is that the All England Club and the City are highly successful despite the lack of local champions. The Championships, Wimbledon at the All England Club is the most internationally prestigious tennis event despite the rarity of British winners. London's financial industry has boomed since the deregulation of U.K. financial markets (the "Big Bang") in the 1980s under the Thatcher government - but has also become dominated by foreign companies, especially American investment banks, rather than British firms (a result opposite to the original intention of the reforms).

The analogy is typically used to mark a debate over whether it matters if an industry is primarily domestically owned if easing of foreign ownership restrictions allows the economy to benefit from foreign investment and increased global competition. The phrase can be used positively to assert the economic success of liberal attitudes towards foreign ownership (and sometimes to emphasize that such attitudes promote a level playing field for domestic and foreign interests alike); or it can be used negatively to emphasize how these policies have eroded a nation's ability to produce globally leading domestic companies. This opposing perspective is represented by economic patriotism and "national champion" policies.

The analogy has also been used in policy discourses outside Britain - most notably in the business discourse of Japan, whose financial markets and other parts of the economy (as of 2006) have not yet been substantially opened up to foreign competition compared with its international peers. It has also, for instance, been used in banking reform debates in South Korea as well as in discussing Business Process Outsourcing in India.

 See also Frank Arthur Calder, Canadian politician;

Frank Calder (November 17, 1877-February 4, 1943) was the first NHL President (1917-1943).

Two trophies in professional hockey are named for him -- the NHL Calder Memorial Trophy for NHL rookies, and the AHL Calder Cup for the overall playoff championship.

Frank Calder was born to Scottish parents in Bristol, England on November 17, 1877 and as a youth played soccer. As a young man, he immigrated to Canada and became a teacher at a private school. Before leaving the United Kingdom, he flipped a coin to decide whether to emigrate to Canada or the United States. He married a fellow teacher, Amelia Cole, and they had three daughters and one son.

He got a job as sports editor at the Montreal Witness. From there, he jumped to the Montreal Herald and Daily Telegraph. After that, he left Elmer Ferguson to be sports editor and moved on to the financial editor's chair which covered what was then Canada's largest market, the Montreal Stock Exchange. He also kept on with sports, creating the Montreal School Rugby League and was secretary of a soccer league.

Calder fell in love with hockey about this time and eventually Sam Lictenhein, owner  of the
Montreal Wanderers of the National Hockey Association, recommended that Calder become part
of the league's executive committee. In 1916-17, the NHA's owners decided to drop Eddie Livingstone's Toronto Blueshirts and took his players. The NHA's president, Frank Robinson, seeing he was as powerless as his predecessor Emmett Quinn was, resigned as NHA president and here was Calder's opportunity as the league's secretary. He decided that the NHA owners allied against Eddie Livingstone needed someone to represent them, and, in effect, Calder was---at least for all practical purposes---the new president of the NHA. He arranged meetings between the NHA's owners to figure out how to get rid of Livingstone. They decided to form a new league, the National Hockey League, in the NHA's place, and then revive the NHA once Livingstone was squeezed out. Calder named himself president of the new league, formed on November 26, 1917. Meanwhile, the owners could not bring back the NHA, as Livingstone made it impossible with his firm stand.

Calder wielded his power as president with such authority that there was no getting crossways
with him. If he ordered the Quebec Bulldogs franchise forfeited to Hamilton, as happened in 1920, one never was to challenge him. A good example of his authority was when the Hamilton Tigers went on strike in 1925. Rather than talk to the players, he suspended and fined them $200 each.

It is of note that Calder was very adamant about not restricting minorities into the NHL. During the 1927-28 season, upon hearing of the Boston Black Panthers, the first all-Black hockey team, he remarked, "Pro hockey has no ruling against the colored man, nor is it likely to ever draw the line," a reference to the segregation in baseball.

Only one attempt to remove Calder as president of the NHL was made. This was in 1932-33 when the owner of the Chicago Black Hawks, Frederic McLaughlin, circulated a letter to the NHL board of governors to remove him. The board rejected the motion.

Commencing with the 1932-33 season, Calder named the top rookie in the NHL. Starting in 1936-37, he got the NHL's board of governors to let him buy a trophy to give to the league's top rookie and he did this until 1941-42.

Calder received a silver service in 1937-38 for his 20 years as president of the NHL and the league extended their appreciation.

Calder was presiding over a meeting of the NHL's board of governors on January 25, 1943
when he suffered a heart attack, and then he had yet another heart attack in a Toronto hospital. On February 3, he felt well enough to travel and returned to Montreal the next day, checking into Montreal General Hospital upon arrival. There he suffered the fatal heart attack that claimed his life that morning.

In his memory, the NHL's board of governors donated the Calder Memorial Trophy to go to the NHL's top rookie.

On his passing in 1943, Frank Calder was interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal, Quebec.

<doc id="2117570" title="History of New York City (1946-1977)" nonfiltered="1148" processed="1133" dbindex="1481159">




The history of New York City (1946 1977) saw the emergence of New York immediately after World War II as the unquestioned leading city of the world. However, after peaking in population in 1950, the city slowly declined with changes in industry and commerce, urban sprawl outside the city and crime, reaching something of a crisis period in the 1970s.

Post-war through mid-century.
As many of the world's great cities lay in ruin after World War II, New York City assumed a new global prominence, even becoming home to United Nations headquarters, built 1947 1952. After the war New York inherited the role of Paris as center of the art world with Abstract Expressionism, and became a rival to London as an art market. However, the population declined after 1950, with increasing suburbanization in the New York metropolitan area as pioneered in Levittown, New York. 

Prosperity was accompanied by an unprecendented building boom, beginning around 1950 and lasting for about twenty years. This led to a drastic change in the appearance of especially Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, where bland office towers in the new International Style began to replace the ziggurat-style towers of the postwar era. Also rapidly changing was the eastern edge of the East Village close to the FDR-Drive. Large-scale public housing projects supplanted many traditional apartment blocks.

In a built-out city, construction always entailed destruction. After the old Beaux Arts Pennsylvania Station was torn down, growing concern for preservation led to the creation of the Landmarks Preservation Commission Law of 1965. The city's other great train station, Grand Central, was also threatened with demolition but was eventually saved. Meanwhile, New York City's network of freeways spread under the guidance of developer Robert Moses, with consequent increased traffic congestion.

In 1960, after Lord Buckley's death, the hated New York City Cabaret Card required of nightclub workers was abolished.

The federal Immigration Act of 1965 abolished national-origin quotas and laid the basis for the city's modern Asian American community.



Economic tribulation had by then begun. An early sign of the city's waning competitiveness was the loss of both its National League baseball teams to booming California; the Dodgers and the Giants both moved after the 1957 season. Only one was replaced, by the Mets in 1962.

On November 9, 1965, New York endured a widespread power blackout along with much of eastern North America. (The city's ordeal became the subject of a motion picture, Where Were You When The Lights Went Out?) Manufacturing declined, and the advent of container shipping shifted much maritime trade to New Jersey, which, unlike New York City, had space to accommodate large stacks of containers. Adult entertainment sites began to fill the Times Square district in the mid-1960s and remained until redevelopment of the area in the mid-1990s.

As African-Americans pressed for civil rights in the 1960s, some chose not to follow the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s nonviolent path. Riots in New York City in 1964 and 1968 produced little improvement in black citizens' inadequate housing, education, and employment but added to the city's growing reputation as unsafe.

The Stonewall Rebellion.


A series of violent conflicts between lesbians, gay men, bisexual, and transgender people and police officers, known as the Stonewall riots and collectively as the Stonewall Rebellion, is credited with catalyzing the modern LGBT rights movement worldwide. 

The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 not long after 1:20 a.m., when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. It was one of the first times in modern history a significant number of LGBT people collectively resisted arrest.

By the end of July the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was formed in New York and by the end of the year the GLF could be seen in cities and universities around the United States. Similar organizations were soon created in other countries, including Canada, France, Britain, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.

The following year, in commemoration of the Stonewall Riots, the GLF organized a march from Greenwich Village to Central Park. Between 5,000 and 10,000 men and women attended the march, a precursor to the contemporary LGBT pride parades.

1970s.

The 1970s are widely regarded as New York's nadir. The city had become notorious the world over for high rates of crime and other social disorder. A popular song in the autumn of 1972, "American City Suite," chronicled, in allegorical fashion, the decline in the city's quality of life.

US economic stagnation in the 1970s hit New York City particularly hard, as trading on the New York Stock Exchange fell while the city's generous welfare spending continued. The city neared bankruptcy during the administration of Mayor Abraham Beame but avoided that fate with the aid of a large federal loan. A statement by Mayor Beame was drafted and ready to be released on October 17, 1975, if the teachers' union did not invest $150 million from its pension funds in city securities. "I have been advised by the comptroller that the City of New York has insufficient cash on hand to meet debt obligations due today," the statement said. "This constitutes the default that we have struggled to avoid."  The Beame statement was never distributed because Albert Shanker, the teachers' union president, finally furnished $150 million from the union's pension fund to buy Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds. (President Gerald R. Ford angered many New Yorkers two weeks later by refusing an outright grant to the city, a decision famously, if inaccurately, summarized by the New York Daily News headline "Ford to City: Drop Dead.")

The New York City Blackout of 1977 struck on July 13th of that year and lasted for 25 hours, during which the city suffered heavy looting and civil unrest. Arrests numbering over 3,000 so burdened the city's already crowded prisons that some talked of re-opening the Manhattan Detention Complex, nicknamed "The Tombs," which had recently been condemned.

A rare highlight was the opening of the mammoth World Trade Center complex in 1972. Conceived by David Rockefeller and built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on the site of the Radio Row electronics district in Lower Manhattan, the Twin Towers briefly displaced the Empire State Building in Midtown as the world's tallest before being displaced in turn by Chicago's Sears Tower in 1973.

However, the financial crisis, high crime rates, and damage from the blackouts led to a widespread belief that New York City was in irreversible decline. Many white middle class families moved to the city's suburbs and to other economically healthier locales. By the end of the 1970s, nearly a million people had left, a population loss not recovered for another twenty years. The election of the more fiscally conservative Ed Koch as mayor in 1977 is widely seen as marking the retreat of socialism in New York City.

This article is about the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. For other meanings, see: Alhambra (disambiguation).;



The Alhambra (Arabic:         = Al  amr '; literally "the red") is an ancient palace and fortress complex of the Moorish monarchs of Granada, in southern Spain (known as Al-Andalus when the fortress was constructed), occupying a hilly terrace on the south-eastern border of the city of Granada. It was the residence of the Muslim kings of Granada and their court, but is currently a museum exhibiting exquisite Islamic architecture.



Overview.


This terrace or plateau, which measures about 740 m (2430 ft) in length by 205 m (674 ft) at its greatest width, extends from W.N.W. to E.S.E., and covers an area of about 142,000 m². It is enclosed by a strongly fortified wall, which is flanked by thirteen towers.  The river Darro, which foams through a deep ravine on the north, divides the plateau from the Albaicín district of Granada; the Assabica valley, containing the Alhambra Park, on the west and south, and beyond this valley the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror, separate it from the Antequeruela district.

 History .
The name Alhambra, signifying in Arabic the red (Al Hamra        ), is probably derived from the colour of the sun-dried tapia, or bricks made of fine gravel and clay, of which the outer walls are built.  Some authorities, however, hold that it commemorates the red flare of the torches by whose light the work of construction was carried on nightly for many years; others associate it with the name of the founder, Muhammed Ibn Al Ahmar; and others derive it from the Arabic Dar al Amra, House of the Master. The palace was built chiefly between 1248 and 1354, in the reigns of Al Ahmar and his successors; but even the names of the principal artists employed are either unknown or doubtful.  

The splendid arabesques of the interior are ascribed, among other kings, to Yusef I, Mohammed V, Ismail I, etc. After the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, the conquerors began to alter the Alhambra.  The open work was filled up with whitewash, the painting and gilding effaced, the furniture soiled, torn or removed.  Charles V (1516 1556) rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style of the period, and destroyed the greater part of the winter palace to make room for a Renaissance-style structure which has never been completed.  Philip V (1700 1746) italianised the rooms, and completed his palace right in the middle of what had been the Moorish building.  He ran up partitions which blocked up whole apartments. In subsequent centuries under Spanish authorities, Moorish art was further defaced; and in 1812 some of the towers were blown up by the French under Count Sebastiani, while the whole buildings narrowly escaped the same fate.  Napoleon had tried to blow up the whole complex.  Just before his plan was carried out, a soldier who secretly wanted the plan of Napoleon   his commander   to fail, defused the explosives and thus saved the Alhambra for posterity.

In 1821 an earthquake caused further damage. The work of restoration undertaken in 1828 by the architect José Contreras was endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII; and after the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued with fair success by his son Rafael (d. 1890), and his grandson Mariano.

The situation of the Alhambra is one of rare natural beauty; the plateau commands a wide view of the city and plain of Granada, towards the west and north, and of the heights of the Sierra Nevada, towards the east and south. Moorish poets described it as "a pearl set in emeralds," in allusion to the brilliant colour of its buildings, and the luxuriant woods round them. The park (Alameda de la Alhambra), which in spring is overgrown with wild-flowers and grass, was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges and myrtles; its most characteristic feature, however, is the dense wood of English elms brought thither in 1812 by the Duke of Wellington. The park is celebrated for the multitude of its nightingales, and is usually filled with the sound of running water from several fountains and cascades.  These are supplied through a conduit 8 km (5 miles) long, which is connected with the Darro at the monastery of Jesus del Valle, above Granada. 

In spite of the long neglect, wilful vandalism and sometimes ill-judged restoration which the Alhambra has endured, it remains the most perfect example of Moorish art in its final European development, freed from the direct Byzantine influences which can be traced in the Mezquita cathedral of Córdoba, more elaborate and fantastic than the Giralda at Seville. The majority of the palace buildings are, in ground-plan, quadrangular, with all the rooms opening on to a central court; and the whole reached its present size simply by the gradual addition of new quadrangles, designed on the same principle, though varying in dimensions, and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. In every case the exterior is left plain and austere, as if the architect intended thus to heighten by contrast the splendour of the interior. Within, the palace is unsurpassed for the exquisite detail of its marble pillars and arches, its fretted ceilings and the veil-like transparency of its filigree work in stucco. Sun and wind are freely admitted, and the whole effect is one of the most airy lightness and grace.  Blue, red, and a golden yellow, all somewhat faded through lapse of time and exposure, are the colours chiefly employed.

The decoration consists, as a rule, of stiff, conventional foliage, Arabic inscriptions, and geometrical patterns wrought into arabesques of almost incredible intricacy and ingenuity. Painted tiles are largely used as panelling for the walls.

 A tour of the Alhambra .


The Moorish portion of the Alhambra resembles many medieval Christian strongholds in its threefold arrangement as a castle, a palace and a residential annexe for subordinates. The alcazaba or citadel, its oldest part, is built on the isolated and precipitous foreland which terminates the plateau on the north-west. That is all massive outer walls, towers and ramparts are left. On its watch-tower, the Torre de la Vela, 25 m (85 ft high), the flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised, in token of the Spanish conquest of Granada, on January 2, 1492. A turret containing a huge bell was added in the 18th century, and restored after being damaged by lightning in 1881. Beyond the Alcazaba is the palace of the Moorish kings, or Alhambra properly so-called; and beyond this, again, is the Alhambra Alta (Upper Alhambra), originally tenanted by officials and courtiers.

Access from the city to the Alhambra Park is afforded by the Puerta de las Granadas (Gate of Pomegranates), a massive triumphal arch dating from the 15th century. A steep ascent leads past the Pillar of Charles V, a fountain erected in 1554, to the main entrance of the Alhambra. This is the Puerta Judiciaria (Gate of Judgment), a massive horseshoe archway, surmounted by a square tower, and used by the Moors as an informal court of justice. A hand, with fingers outstretched as a talisman against the evil eye, is carved above this gate on the exterior; a key, the symbol of authority, occupies the corresponding place on the interior.  A narrow passage leads inward to the Plaza de los Aljibes (Place of the Cisterns), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Moorish palace.  To the left of the passage rises the Torre del Vino (Wine Tower), built in 1345, and used in the 16th century as a cellar. On the right is the palace of Charles V, a cold-looking but majestic Renaissance building, out of harmony with its surroundings, which it tends somewhat to dwarf by its superior size. The extremely intricate and detailed designs of the Moors' Alhambra stand in stark contrast to Charles' palace, which consists primarily of white walls with no particularly striking features.  Many modern architectural scholars are thus disgusted by Charles V's preference for simplistic Renaissance styling, which they believe detracts from the Alhambra's architectural magnificence.  Construction of Charles' palace, begun in 1526, was abandoned about 1650. 

The present entrance to the Palacio Árabe, or Casa Real (Moorish palace), is by a small door from which a corridor conducts to the Patio de los Arrayanes (Court of the Myrtles), also called the Patio de la Alberca (Court of the Blessing or Court of the Pond), from the Arabic birka, "pool."  This court is 42 m (140 ft) long by 22 m (74 ft) broad; and in the centre there is a large pond set in the marble pavement, full of goldfish, and with myrtles growing along its sides.  There are galleries on the north and south sides; that on the south 7 m (27 ft) high, and supported by a marble colonnade.  Underneath it, to the right, was the principal entrance, and over it are three elegant windows with arches and miniature pillars.  From this court the walls of the Torre de Comares are seen rising over the roof to the north, and reflected in the pond. 

The Salón de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors) is the largest in the Alhambra, and occupies all the Torre de Comares.  It is a square room, the sides being 12 m (37 ft) in length, while the centre of the dome is 23 m (75 ft) high.  This was the grand reception room, and the throne of the sultan was placed opposite the entrance. It was in this setting that Cristopher Columbus received Isabel and Ferdinand's support to sail to the New World. The tiles are nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) high all round, and the colours vary at intervals.  Over them is a series of oval medallions with inscriptions, interwoven with flowers and leaves.  There are nine windows, three on each facade, and the ceiling is admirably diversified with inlaid-work of white, blue and gold, in the shape of circles, crowns and stars  a kind of imitation of the vault of heaven.  The walls are covered with varied stucco-work of most delicate pattern, surrounding many ancient escutcheons. 


The celebrated Patio de los Leones (Court of the Lions) is an oblong court, 116 ft (35 m) in length by 66 ft (20 m) in breadth, surrounded by a low gallery supported on 124 white marble columns. A pavilion projects into the court at each extremity, with filigree walls and light domed roof, elaborately ornamented. The square is paved with coloured tiles, and the colonnade with white marble; while the walls are covered 5 ft (1.5 m) up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, with a border above and below enamelled blue and gold. The columns supporting the roof and gallery are irregularly placed, with a view to artistic effect; and the general form of the piers, arches and pillars is most graceful.  They are adorned by varieties of foliage, etc.; about each arch there is a large square of arabesques; and over the pillars is another square of exquisite filigree work.  In the centre of the court is the celebrated Fountain of Lions, a magnificent alabaster basin supported by the figures of twelve lions in white marble, not designed with sculptural accuracy, but as emblems of strength and courage. It has been said that the lions were most likely sculpted by members of the Caliphate's Christian community, as making such representational sculpture was not considered allowed by the followers of Islam. 



The Sala de los Abencerrajes (Hall of the Abencerrages) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, last king of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that illustrious line to a banquet, massacred them here. This room is a perfect square, with a lofty dome and trellised windows at its base.  The roof is exquisitely decorated in blue, brown, red and gold, and the columns supporting it spring out into the arch form in a remarkably beautiful manner.  Opposite to this hall is the Sala de las dos Hermanas (Hall of the two Sisters), so-called from two very beautiful white marble slabs laid as part of the pavement.  These slabs measure 50 by 22 cm (15 by 7  in), and are without flaw or stain.  There is a fountain in the middle of this hall, and the roof  a dome honeycombed with tiny cells, all different, and said to number 5000  is a magnificent example of the so-called "stalactite vaulting" of the Moors. 

Among the other wonders of the Alhambra are the Sala de la Justicia (Hall of Justice), the Patio del Mexuar (Court of the Council Chamber), the Patio de Daraxa (Court of the Vestibule), and the Peinador de la Reina (Queen's Robing Room), in which are to be seen the same delicate and beautiful architecture, the same costly and elegant decorations.  The palace and the Upper Alhambra also contain baths, ranges of bedrooms and summer-rooms, a whispering gallery and labyrinth, and vaulted sepulchres.

The original furniture of the palace is represented by the celebrated vase of the Alhambra, a splendid specimen of Moorish ceramic art, dating from 1320, and belonging to the first period of Moorish porcelain.  It is 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) high; the ground is white, and the enamelling is blue, white and gold. 


Of the outlying buildings in connection with the Alhambra, the foremost in interest is the Palacio de Generalife or Gineralife (the Muslim Jennat al Arif, "Garden of Arif," or "Garden of the Architect").  This villa probably dates from the end of the 13th century, but has been several times restored.  Its gardens, however, with their clipped hedges, grottos, fountains, and cypress avenues, are said to retain their original Moorish character.  The Villa de los Martires (Martyrs' Villa), on the summit of Monte Mauror, commemorates by its name the Christian slaves who were employed to build the Alhambra, and confined here in subterranean cells.  The Torres Bermejas (Vermilion Towers), also on Monte Mauror, are a well-preserved Moorish fortification, with underground cisterns, stables, and accommodation for a garrison of 200 men.  Several Roman tombs were discovered in 1829 and 1857 at the base of Monte Mauror.

In the construction of the Alhambra, the Moors had no depictions of people at all excluding the human hand.  Of course, there were plenty of depictions of people on the Renaissance building.

Miscellaneous.
The Alhambra, Generalife and Albayzín of Granada are listed as World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO.  It is also the setting of Washington Irving's classic collection of essays, verbal sketches, and stories entitled  Tales of the Alhambra.  Irving lived in the palace while writing the book, and was instrumental in reintroducing the site to Western audiences.

Additionally, it is the subject of the Ghymes song of the same name.

Parts of the following novels are set in the Alhambra:

 Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh.
 Amin Maalouf's Leon L'Africain, depicting the reconquest of Granada by the Catholic Kings.
 Philippa Gregory's The Constant Princess.

A classical guitar song by Francisco Tárrega is called Recuerdos de la Alhambra (Alhambra Remembrances).

There is a Moorish Revival house in Stillwater, MN that was created and named after the Alhambra.

There is an Alhambra Theatre in central Bradford, England .

Ogbourne St.Andrew is a tiny village in the Kennet district of Wiltshire. It is near the village of Ogbourne St. George and the hamlets of Ogbourne Maizey and Rockley. The village is lacking in local businesses due to its small size, and local primary level children usually go to the school in Ogbourne St. George.

The village has an acclaimed restaurant/pub on the main road called Silks on the Downs (formerly the Wheatsheaf Inn) which also operates as an Inn.

The village has a small church that is run by the Reverend Roger Powell who is also the vicar of Ogbourne St. George and Chiseldon. The church has a ring of five bells with a fifteen hundred-weight tenor tuned to the key of F. In the churchyard there is a long barrow excavated both in 1880 by Maud Cunnington and in 1999.

The so called Atlantic Bronze Age is a cultural complex of the approx. 1300-700 BCE period that includes different cultures of the Iberian peninsula, British Islands and Atlantic France. It is marked by the economic and cultural exchange of some surviving aboriginal cultures that would eventually yield to the advance of Iron Age Indo-Europeans (Celts mostly) at the end of the period. 

Its main centers seem to be in Portugal, Andalusia (Tartessos?) Galicia and Great Britain. Their commercial contacts extend to Denmark and the Mediterranean as well.

Impact maximizing companies endeavor to make the greatest positive impact on society, much like profit maximizing companies, according to the economic theory that defines the term, theoretically work to maximize profit.  

The concept of impact maximization is similar but not identical to that of measuring performance according to a double bottom line.  While impact maximizing companies are created for the purposes of making a positive impact on society, or offering a solution to a social problem, a company that measures its performance via a double bottom line can subjectively determine the weight or value placed on performing according to its financial or social impact-related goals.  Impact maximizing companies aim to maximize the positive impact of their activities on people, and to support these activities by providing products and services for sale to customers.  It can also then be implied that the company will also use reasonable measures to ensure that its social impact-related goals are never compromised by the introduction or sale of its products and/or services.

Syed Sajjad Ali Shah was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In 1997, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's party was elected with a majority large enough for Sharif to change the Constitution to remove several checks and balances on the office of Prime Minister. Sharif dismissed Ali Shah after he attempted to vacate one of these constitutional amendments, leading to a constitutional crisis.

As Chief Justice of Supreme Court.
When Dr. Nasim Hasan Shah retired as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1994, Justice Saad Saud Jan should have rightly taken his place. But Ms Benazir Bhutto threw tradition overboard when she by-passed two senior judges and appointed Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Later she was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari  on charges of corruption and Sajjad Ali Shah along with 6 other members of the Supreme Court upheld this decision. Reading from a 12-page short order, Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah said 
 The presidential order contained enough substance and adequate material had been provided to conclude that the government could not be run in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and that an appeal to the electorate had become necessary.;

Government-Judiciary Row and Intra-Judiciary Scuffle.
Nawaz Sharif & Shah Tussle.
Mr. Shah was the lone dissenter in the 11-member bench whose decision restored Mr. Nawaz Sharif to power in May 1993 after he had been booted out by the then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.Also Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah ordered the release of some civil servants who were arrested by order of the Prime Minister, Mian Nawaz Sharif,Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah also had both plaques, the English and the Urdu versions of the "Objectives Resolution", removed from the hallowed walls of the Supreme Court which still remain bare.All these factors became the starting point of a long tussle between the two men. The first confrontation by Nawaz Sharif was the establishment of special Courts, which were established in contravention of the Chief Justices judicious advice. These special courts, which were established to benefit the Prime Minister's allies and supporters, eventually proved to be a humiliating blot on the face of justice in Pakistan.Later on when the Chief Justice wanted to fill the 5 vacant positions of judges to be able to carry out the business of dispensing justice in a speedy manner, the Prime Minister not only refused to grant the request but went ahead and abolished those vacancies altogether. He had to restore the positions under pressure but refused to fill them up.

Judges Vs.Judges.
In his self-imposed war against the Chief Justice,Nawaz Sharif succeeded in dividing the judges into two camps. The group of judges that sided with the Prime Minister said openly that if Justice Sajjad Ali Shah gives up trying cases against Mian Nawaz Sharif, they will accept him as the Chief Justice. The infamous Article 58(2)(b) a.k.a Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan was restored and suspended within minutes by two separate benches of the apex court assembled against each other.A 3 member bench headed by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah suspended the operation of the Thirteenth Amendment restoring the powers of the president to dissolve the National Assembly, a verdict which was within minutes set aside by another 10-member bench.The 10-member bench headed by Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui granted stay against the chief justice's order minutes after it was passed, even without receiving any formal petition or the copy of the order. All efforts to resolve the judicial crisis failed as both the judges' groups stuck to their stance and issued separate cause lists.The dissident judges, who do not acknowledge Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as chief justice, issued a fresh cause list for 15 members' full court session. The full court, headed by Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, took up petitions questioning the validity of chief justice's appointment. 

The Stand off with Quetta Bench of The Supreme Court.
Quetta bench of the apex court held the appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in abeyance till further orders and restrained him from performing judicial and administrative functions. The bench also held in abeyance the operation of the notification of June 5, 1994 issued by the president appointing Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as the Chief Justice of Pakistan. The Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, declared the order of the two-member Supreme Court bench at Quetta "without lawful authority", and directed the assistant registrar, Quetta registry, not to fix any case before the two judges till further orders.Justice Shah, whose appointment as the chief justice was held in abeyance by the two-member bench, continued working as the chief justice of Pakistan.In his order the chief justice observed that under Order XXV of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, a petition under Article 184(3) under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was to be filed only at the principal seat and not at any other registry.He said;
In this respect there are orders and directions that if any such petition under that provision Article 184(3) is filed at any other registry,it is to be forwarded straight-away to the principal seat for orders to be obtained from the chief justice for its fixation before a proper bench. ;
    
He observed that if any orders had been passed in that petition 
they should be deemed to have not taken effect for the reason that 
proper procedure had been followed.
    
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah further stated that even registration 
number could not be given to such petitions at the registry without 
the permission or express orders of the chief justice. The CJ 
directed that the record of the above mentioned petition may be 
summoned immediately from Quetta Registry for placement before him 
for further orders in this respect.
    
Justice Shah further observed that "honourable" judges present at 
the Quetta registry had acted without lawful authority and directed 
the assistant registrar of Quetta registry not to fix cases before 
them for disposal until further orders.
    
It is the second instance in the judicial history of Pakistan when 
two judges of the Supreme Court were asked not to perform 
their duties. Earlier in 1996, two ad hoc judges of the Supreme 
Court were asked by the same chief justice not to perform their 
judicial functions .The Quetta bench of the Supreme Court later held that the impugned executive order of the Chief Justice is nullity and is to be ignored. The bench also over-ruled the executive order of Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah regarding not fixing the cases before it.
    
When the proceedings of the court started, it was pointed out to 
the bench that a fax has been received from Chief Justice Syed 
Sajjad Ali Shah with the direction to the Assistant Registrar, 
Quetta Registry that no case should be fixed for hearing before the 
said bench until further orders.One of the senior judge observed that;
it is misconduct on the part of Chief Justice as none of the Supreme Court judge can be restrained from the work on executive order and said that judicial order had already suspended the Chief Justice to perform his duties as Chief Justice.;
    
The full bench after ignoring the orders of the Chief Justice 
disposed off 10 cases. These cases were fixed before the bench by 
Advocate General Balochistan and counsels of different petitioners.
The court had also ordered the Chief Justice of Pakistan that he 
should not perform his judicial and administrative duties as Chief 
Justice till the decision of the said bench regarding the petition. 
Notices in this regard had been issued to Attorney General, Deputy 
Attorney general and others.The Supreme Court's circuit bench at Peshawar endorsed the verdict of the Quetta bench on a petition challenging the appointment of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as chief justice of Pakistan.But Justice Sajjad Ali Shah persevered and continued hearing the contempt case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Finally that infamous attack on the Supreme Court on November 28, 1997 took place.

President & The Army.
Then Two high-level meetings at the Aiwan-i-Sadr took place but  failed to resolve the political crisis. Army chief Gen Jehangir Karamat had not so far come up with a solution acceptable to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.

Later after the incident occurred, Former Chief of Pakistan Army, Gen (Rtd) Jehangir Karamat, refused to send troops to dispel a mob attack on Pakistan s Supreme Court in 1997 despite pleas from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court since as he said, he was obliged to uphold the constitution of Pakistan. Gen Karamat pointed out that there was an established chain of command and any instructions of that sort should have come from the elected prime minister and the president, who is also the supreme commander.

Reinforcing his argument General Karamat said a precedent would have been established if he had acted on the former Chief Justice Shah s request, promoting chief justices of provincial high courts to make demands on corps commanders to deal with certain situations. That s why, he said, he decided to keep the army out of the political trappings.

The Attack on Supreme Court.   
Pakistan grappled with its worst-ever constitutional crisis when an unruly mob stormed into the supreme court, forcing Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah to adjourn the contempt of court case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Hundreds of Pakistan Muslim League supporters and members of its youth wing, the Muslim Students Front(MSF), breached the police cordon around the courthouse when defence lawyer S M Zafar was arguing his case. 

A journalist rushed into the courtroom and warned the bench of an impending attack. Whereupon, the chief justice got up abruptly, thanked Zafar and adjourned the hearing. While judicial members left the courtroom soon after, the mob entered it shouting slogans, and damaged furniture. 
The unruly mob, led by ruling party member from Punjab Sardar Naseem and Colonel (retired) Mushtaq Tahir Kheli, Sharif's political secretary, chanted slogans against the chief justice. The mob also beat up Pakistan People's Party senator Iqbal Haidar. The police managed to restore normalcy after baton charging and teargassing the mob, both inside and outside the courthouse. The court which assembled at 9:45am, could continue the proceedings for only about 45 minutes.

Shah & The letter to the President.
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah requested President Farooq Leghari to take steps to post army or paramilitary soldiers in the Supreme Court building, and at the residences of the chief justice and other judges hearing the contempt case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
    
In his letter Justice Sajjad Ali Shah narrated the incidents which 
took place in the court. He stated that during the hearing of the contempt case against the prime minister and others, certain advocates stooped to rowdiness. He said some of the intruders were overheard saying that they wanted to take the CJ hostage.
    
The case was adjourned and the judges were taken to the chamber of 
the chief justice under police escort. He said after Thursday's 
rowdy scenes in the court room, he had directed the registrar to 
issue passes only to people concerned as usually government 
supporters jam-packed the court. The chief justice further said 
several people had informed him over telephone that a BBC report 
about the attack showed policemen doing nothing to stop the mob.
    
He said when court officials present at the gate asked the police 
as to why they were not preventing the crowd from entering the 
premises, they replied that since most of the protesters were 
government supporters, they were helpless.
    
Justice Sajjad said films were available with court officials to 
show how big the crowds were and how they broke into the court 
room. He further said court officials told him that when the mob 
was dispersing, they heard announcements that arrangements had been made for lunch at the Punjab House.

Stance of Sindh High Court.
A division bench of the High Court of Sindh requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan to convene a full court meeting of the SC, to be chaired by himself, to consider the controversy surrounding his appointment.However, The Supreme Court Quetta bench  maintained its interim order suspending Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah and barring him from performing administrative and judicial functions. The bench referred the matter to the full court for final decision.

Justice Sajjad Ali Shah informed the 10-member bench that he would contest the case, and engaged Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, a prominent lawyer, to represent him.

Resignation of President of Pakistan Farooq Leghari.
A severe blow to the Justice Sajjad Ali Shah came when President Farooq Leghari tendered his resignation saying he could not violate the Constitution and the law to oblige the Government. Speaking at a press conference Mr. Leghari said he had opted to resign because he did not want to become a party to the violation of law and the Constitution. He said he had received a summary from the Government asking him to de-notify the appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and appoint Justice Ajmal Mian as the acting Chief Justice of Pakistan. Wasim Sajjad, Chairman Senate, assumed office of the acting President. Under the Constitution, on the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the President, the Chairman of the Senate acts as the President. The new president shall have to be elected not later than 30 days' period.

Acting CJ Appointed.
Later Justice Ajmal Mian, the senior-most Judge, was sworn in as acting Chief Justice of Pakistan. Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui administered the oath. The ceremony was attended by Governors of all the 4 provinces, 3 Chief Ministers, 2 Federal Ministers, Judges of the Supreme 
Court, Federal Shariat Court (FSC), High Courts, retired Judges of the 
Supreme Court, the Attorney-General and senior lawyers of the apex 
Court. Justice Ajmal Mian was one of three judges who were superseded by Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in 1994. Up until this clash of the Government and Judiciary, none of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah s colleagues had ever questioned his appointment and even his past decisions up until this time cannot be questioned. The Nawaz Sharif's government said at this point the Supreme Court is free to do what it likes. Justice Sajjad Ali Shah expressed shock and surprise at the decision to remove him.Those who have followed Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in the Supreme Chair have still to identify and punish the desecrators of the people's apex court.

Permanent CJ Supreme Court.
Justice Ajmal Mian took administrative control of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and fixed a new roaster and issued a new cause-list. Justice Ajmal Mian constituted 6 benches including the 10- member bench which  continued hearing of the petitions challenging the appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of Pakistan.The 10-member bench also took up the petition challenging the Thirteenth Amendment. After the conclusion of two cases, Ajmal Mian was appointed as permanent Chief Justice of Pakistan on December 23,1997.

<doc id="249167" title="Luther Vandross" nonfiltered="1158" processed="1143" dbindex="1481170">



Luther Ronzoni Vandross, Jr. (April 20, 1951   July 1, 2005) was an eight-time Grammy-winning American R&B and soul singer and songwriter. During his career, Vandross sold over 25 million albums and won eight Grammy awards including Best Male R&B Vocal Performance four times. He won four Grammy Awards in 2004 including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the track "Dance With My Father", co-written with Richard Marx.

Biography.
1951-1980: Early life and career.
Born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, Vandross grew up in a musical family that moved to the Bronx when he was thirteen. His sister sang with vocal group The Crests who had a number two hit in the early 1960's with "Sixteen Candles". Vandross' father died of diabetes when Vandross was eight years old. His life-changing moment came when at the age of thirteen he heard Dionne Warwick sing "Anyone Who Had A Heart" (a song he would cover in his later years).


Vandross was in a vocal group, "Listen My Brother", in high school which once played at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. His first recording credit was as producer of the album Soul Christmas in 1968 and appeared as a vocalist on the Quincy Jones album Best in 1969. He was also a member of a theater workshop at the time and appeared on the first episode of Sesame Street in November 1969.

He attended Western Michigan University for a year, but then dropped out to continue pursuing a career in music.

His next recording credit was on an album by Roberta Flack in 1972. Vandross wrote "Everybody Rejoice", for the 1975 Broadway musical and 1978 movie The Wiz. He also appeared as a choir member in the movie. Having co-written "Fascination" for David Bowie's Young Americans, he went on to tour with him in September 1974.

Vandross also sang backing vocals for Diana Ross, Roberta Flack, Carly Simon, Chaka Khan, Donna Summer, Bette Midler, Chic, and Barbra Streisand. During the beginning of his career, Vandross was content to remain mostly in the background, as a producer and backup singer for other artists. Flack encouraged Vandross into starting his own career.  She believed he was an incredible talent who, in addition to his songwriting and production skills, deserved to be heard.

Before his breakthrough, he released two albums with a singing group he formed, also called Luther, on Cotillion Records. The group had a successful single entitled "It's Good for the Soul", although their two albums - the self-titled Luther in 1976 and This Close to You in 1977 - were not successful. Vandross bought back the rights to these albums after the record label dropped the group, preventing their later re-release.

Vandross also wrote and sang commercials jingles during the late 1970s & early 1980s, earning upwards of $600,000 per year around the New York area. He created and often sang jingles for such advertising campaigns as Kentucky Fried Chicken's "We Do Chicken Right", NBC's "Proud As A Peacock"  and The US Army's "Be All You Can Be". Vandross also voiced a cartoon character named Zack for 3 Saturday morning animated PSA spots for ABC Television called "Zack of All Trades". Vandross continued his successful career as a popular session singer during the late 70's.  His lead vocals can be heard on the Gregg Diamond produced single "Hot Butterfly" from Bionic Boogie in 1978 which gained moderate club success.

1980-2003: Career success.

He eventually made his breakthrough as a guest singer with the group Change. Their 1980 hits, "The Glow of Love" and "Searching" led to a recording contract with Epic Records, and in 1981, he made his first solo recording debut with the album Never Too Much, that contained the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song "A House is Not a Home". The album went double platinum, with the song "Never Too Much" reaching number-one on the R&B charts. This period also marked the beginning of frequent songwriting collaboration with bassist Marcus Miller, who played on many of the tracks, and would also produce or co-produce a number of tracks for Vandross.

Vandross released a series of successful albums during the 1980s and continued his session work with guest vocals on groups like Charme in 1982. Although the albums were very successful overall, many of his earlier albums made a much bigger impact on the R&B charts. Vandross had more modest success on the pop charts during this time. During the 1980s, Vandross had two other singles that reached number-one on the R&B charts: "Stop to Love" in 1986 and a duet with Gregory Hines "There's Nothing Better Than Love" He was also an in-demand producer; he was at the helm for Aretha Franklin's  albums Jump To It and Get It Right. In 1983, the opportunity to work with his main music influence, music icon, Dionne Warwick came true. Their collaboration on Dionne's fourth album for Arista was "How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye." The title track duet became a smash hit overall on the charts, but especially on the R&B and Adult Contemporary chart. The album's second single, "Got a Date" became a moderate hit. Vandross produced and wrote the songs on the album. He also contributed vocals alongside Dionne on the album. The "How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye" album is still highly sought after.

The 1989 compilation of greatest hits, The Best Of Luther Vandross...The Best Of Love, included the ballad "Here And Now", the first Vandross single to chart in the Billboard pop chart top ten. He also won his first award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in the Grammy Awards of 1991. "Here and Now" became a staple at weddings, and on Soft AC radio. In addition, the song allowed him to expand his musical horizons beyond R  his songs also became popular on smooth jazz radio.



More albums followed in the 1990s, beginning with 1991's Power of Love which spawned two top ten pop hits. He won his second Best Male R&B Vocal in the Grammy Awards of 1992 with the track "Power of Love/Love Power" winning the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in the same year. In 1992, "The Best Things in Life are Free", a duet with Janet Jackson from the movie Mo' Money became a hit.

In 1993, Vandross had a nonspeaking role in the Robert Townsend movie Meteor Man. He played a hit man who plotted to stop Townsend's title character.

Vandross hit the top ten again in 1994 with "Endless Love", a duet with Mariah Carey, from the album Songs and a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's hit song from the film Endless Love. He also sang a duet with Frank Sinatra on Sinatra's Duets album. In the Grammy Awards of 1997, he won his third Best Male R&B Vocal for the track "Your Secret Love". A second greatest hits album, released in 1997, compiled most of his 1990s hits and was his final record released through Epic Records. After recording "I Know" on Virgin Records, he signed with J Records.  His first album on Clive Davis' new label, entitled Luther Vandross, was released in 2001, and it produced the hits "Take You Out", "Grown Thangs" and "I'd Rather".

In 2003, Vandross released the album Dance With My Father in memory of his father. The title track, which was dedicated to the memory of the younger Vandross' childhood dances with his father, won Luther and his co-writer, singer Richard Marx, the 2004 Grammy Award for Song Of The Year. The song also won Vandross his fourth and final award in the Best Male R&B Vocal Performance category. The album was also the first album by Vandross to reach number-one on the Billboard album chart. The video for the title track features a various celebrities alongside their dads and family members. Celebrities such as Beyoncé, Celine Dion, Jason Kidd, Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones submitted home videos or pictures of their families for the music video.

Vandross's last known recording was his signature version of "One Shining Moment", CBS's closing theme song of the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship.

2003-2005: Illness and death.

Vandross had diabetes, a disease that ran in his family, as well as hypertension. His weight fluctuated several times over the years, and Vandross had weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg) at his heaviest. His father, Luther Sr., died of complications from diabetes when Luther Jr. was eight years old. Luther Jr.'s two sisters and a brother also predeceased him. On April 16, 2003, Vandross suffered a stroke in his home in Manhattan. Though the cause of Vandross' stroke was not specifically attributed to diabetes, diabetics have been identified as being much more susceptible to strokes than non-diabetics. 

He appeared briefly on videotape at the 2004 Grammys to accept his Song of the Year award, he was otherwise never seen in public again. On the videotape on which Vandross appeared, he sent an emotional message that said: "Whenever I say goodbye it's never for long because I believe in the power of love".
Vandross died on July 1, 2005 at John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey at the age of 54. At this time, the cause of death was not known, although hospital spokesman Rob Cavanaugh has said that Vandross never recovered from the 2003 stroke. It was reported that he died peacefully, surrounded by his family and friends.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a friend of Vandross, described him as "a boy so mellow, so powerful; a boy of rare, rare vintage. We lost Luther very early because of his medical condition, but his legacy will be a powerful legacy."

His funeral was in New York City on July 8, 2005. After two days of viewing, Vandross was laid to rest in George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.

Personal life.
During Vandross's entire career, he was dogged by questions regarding his sexuality. A lifelong bachelor, his name was never romantically linked in the media with women. Although Vandross never explicitly denied being gay, he never publicly acknowledged it either. He generally attempted to steer questioners away from the issue altogether by saying that his busy lifestyle made marriage difficult and indicated that it wasn't what he wanted. After his death, an article in Out magazine had several of Vandross' friends, including gay comedy writer Bruce Vilanch, claiming that Luther was indeed a very unhappily closeted gay man.

Influences and followers.
Vandross was inspired by the soul divas of the 1960s and 1970s: Dionne Warwick, Patti LaBelle, Diana Ross, and Aretha Franklin, whom he eventually produced.

Vandross' songs have also been covered numerous times by American Idol contestants. Most notable covers include Season 1 Finalist Tamyra Gray's cover of "Dance With My Father" on Boston Public and "A House is Not a Home", which many consider one of the greatest performances in the show's history. Season 2 Winner Ruben Studdard has also covered "A House is Not a Home" and more infamously "Superstar". R&B artist Keyshia Cole covered Vandross' 1981 hit "Never too much" for her 2005 debut album The Way It Is.

Vandross did many covers of older songs, such as "Since I Lost My Baby" (originally recorded by The Temptations), "Love the One You're With" (originally recorded by Stephen Stills), "Superstar/Until You Come Back To Me" ("Superstar" was a hit for The Carpenters and "Until You Come Back To Me" was a 1974 hit for Aretha Franklin), "Love Won't Let Me Wait" (originally recorded by Major Harris), "Always and Forever" (originally recorded by Heatwave), "If This World Were Mine" (originally recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell), "Creepin'" and "Knocks Me Off My Feet" (both originally recorded by Stevie Wonder), "Hello" (the 1984 number-one hit by Lionel Richie), "Lovely Day" (originally recorded by Bill Withers), "Killing Me Softly" (originally recorded by Roberta Flack) and "A House is Not A Home", a Burt Bacharach standard. His hit "Love Power" included snippets of the soul classic "The Power of Love".  Another hit, "Bad Boy (Having a Party)", contained a passage from Sam Cooke's "Having a Party".

Vandross inspired his J Records labelmate, Ruben Studdard, the American Idol winner of 2003. Besides Studdard, Vandross also inspired countless other artists, both male and female, such as Boyz II Men, Usher, Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, and Brandy. It was with Beyoncé that he recorded yet another cover of a well-known song, "The Closer I Get to You", originally recorded by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway.

Legacy.
Tribute.
On September 20, 2005, the album So Amazing: An All-Star Tribute to Luther Vandross was released. The album is a collection of some of Luther's songs performed by various artists. The artists on this compilation include  Stevie Wonder, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Fantasia, Beyoncé, Donna Summer, Alicia Keys, Cissy Houston, Elton John, Celine Dion, Wyclef Jean, Babyface, Patti LaBelle, John Legend, Angie Stone, Jamie Foxx and Aretha Franklin, who won a Grammy for her rendition of "A House Is Not a Home".

Posthumous releases.
Luther Vandross's home label, J Records, recently released a song called "Shine" to radio, an upbeat R&B track sampling Chic's disco classic "My Forbidden Lover". "Shine" became a massive Top 20 Urban radio hit. The success of the "Shine" led to club mixes of the single. The Freemasons Club Mix of "Shine" became popular on Dance format radio stations and Dancehalls across the U.S. This and a track titled "Got You Home" are never-before-released songs that appeared on The Ultimate Luther Vandross, a greatest hits album that showcases his greatest hits on Epic Records/J Records/Legacy Recordings. The album was released August 22, 2006.

<doc id="168257" title="Steppenwolf (band)" nonfiltered="1163" processed="1148" dbindex="1481175">

This article is about the band. For other uses, see Steppenwolf.;

Steppenwolf is a rock band, starting out in 1967 and best known for the hits "Born to Be Wild", "Magic Carpet Ride" and "The Pusher".  Due to the German background of the band's leader John Kay, they were named after the novel Steppenwolf by author Hermann Hesse.

Background.
At the age of 4, John Kay and his mother, after escaping from East Prussia, fled from Soviet occupied East Germany to West Germany (an event recounted in the song "Renegade" on the album Steppenwolf Seven and "The Wall" on the album Rise and Shine), before moving to Canada in 1958.

Steppenwolf had its origins in a Toronto blues band called The Sparrow, which was formed in 1964 and played coffeehouses in Yorkville. By 1967 they had settled in San Francisco, playing high energy mix of blues rock, psychedelia and folk music. Producer Gabriel Mekler of the label Dunhill Records in Los Angeles suggested the band introduce more aggressive beats. With music that pioneered hard rock and heavy metal, they became Steppenwolf.  This band's original members were:
John Kay, vocals, guitar, harmonica;
Jerry Edmonton, drums;
Michael Monarch, lead guitar;
Goldy McJohn, keyboards;
Rushton Moreve, bass;

Success.
Steppenwolf rocketed to world-wide fame after their third single, "Born To Be Wild" as well as their cover of Hoyt Axton's "The Pusher" were used in the cult film Easy Rider (both titles originally were released on the band's debut album). "Born To Be Wild" was written by Jerry Edmonton's elder brother Dennis, who was lead guitarist of The Sparrows and early Steppenwolf. He left them to perform solo using the name Mars Bonfire. "Born To Be Wild" reached number 2 on the charts. The song introduced to rock lyrics the signature term "heavy metal" (in fact, not about a kind of music, but about a bike: "I like smoke and lightning, heavy metal thunder, racin' with the wind...").

This was followed by several more hits, including "Magic Carpet Ride" (which reached #3) from Steppenwolf The Second and "Rock Me" (which reached #10) from At Your Birthday Party. Many fans consider their double album Steppenwolf Live (an extended single album in the UK) the best of Steppenwolf's releases, though John Kay expressed a personal dislike for the album in his autobiography, Magic Carpet Ride.

Monster, which criticized US policy of the Nixon-era, and Steppenwolf 7 were the band's most political albums, and are still fondly remembered by fans as two of the best rock & roll snapshots of the attitudes of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Breakup and reformation.
The band broke up in 1971 following the release of another political concept album, For Ladies Only, and Kay went on to a successful though inconsistent solo career, scoring a minor solo hit in 1972 with "I'm Movin' On" from his album Forgotten Songs and Unsung Heroes. Steppenwolf reformed in 1974 with the album Slow Flux, which produced the minor hit "Straight Shooting Woman," then disbanded again in 1976. From 1977 until 1980 Steppenwolf reformed for touring, this time with various former members but without Kay himself. A new studio album, Night Of The Wolf was recorded in 1979 but never released. The new Steppenwolf, according to Kay's autobiography, turned out to be a shell of the original band, and caused the reputation of the band to deteriorate. Lawsuits were fought. To protect the name, John Kay formed a new version of Steppenwolf in the early 1980s and went on tour as "John Kay and Steppenwolf", as well as releasing a solo album in 2001.

The band still tours on a regular basis and enjoys world-wide popularity, and is especially popular in Canada and Ontario, where John Kay began his musical career.
The latest newsletter from John Kay's Wolfpack fanclub states the following: "As you are probably aware, 2007 marks our 40th anniversary and 2007 will also be the last year of touring for John Kay & Steppenwolf .... 1967-2007-ONE HELLUVA RIDE!"
There will be also some remastering of the band's classic albums throughout this year 2007.

Trivia.
In the Neil Young biography, "Shakey", Neil Young attributes his guitar style to the influence of John Kay. Young and Kay are both Canadians. Former founding Steppenwolf member Goldy McJohn once played in a band with Young and Rick James known as The Mynah Birds.

In 2004, John Kay was inducted onto Canada's Walk of Fame, in recognition of his early years as a Canadian citizen and the beginnings of his musical career in Toronto.  Whereas any celebrity that meets criteria can finance their way into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, inductees to Canada's Walk of Fame are selected via a supervising committee, and thus must earn their honour.  John Kay was present at the induction ceremony in Toronto, and reiterated his strong affection for Canada.

<doc id="20709" title="Mary II of England" nonfiltered="1166" processed="1151" dbindex="1481178">


Mary II (30 April 1662 28 December 1694) reigned as Queen of England and Ireland from 13 February 1689, and as Queen of Scotland (as Mary II of Scotland) from 11 April 1689 until her death. Mary, a Protestant, came to the thrones following the Glorious Revolution, which resulted in the deposition of her Roman Catholic father, James II. Mary reigned jointly with her husband and first cousin, William III, who became the sole ruler of both countries upon her death in 1694. Popular histories usually refer to the joint reigns as those of "William and Mary". Mary, although a sovereign in her own right, did not wield power during most of her reign, instead ceding it to her husband. She did, however, govern the realms when William was engaged in military campaigns abroad.

Early life.
Mary, born at St. James Palace in London  on 30 April, 1662, was the eldest daughter of James, Duke of York (the future James II of England) and of his first wife, Lady Anne Hyde.
Mary's uncle was King Charles II; her maternal grandfather, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, served for a lengthy period as Charles's chief advisor. Although her mother bore eight children, only Mary and her younger sister Anne survived into adulthood.

The Duke of York converted to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne had a  Protestant upbringing, pursuant to the command of Charles II. Mary's mother died in 1671; her father married again in 1673, taking as his second wife the Catholic Mary of Modena, also known as Mary Beatrice d'Este.

At the age of fifteen, Princess Mary became betrothed to the Protestant Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange. William was the son of her aunt, Mary, Princess Royal, and Prince William II of Nassau. At first, Charles II opposed the alliance with a Dutch ruler   he preferred that Mary marry the heir to the French Throne, the Dauphin Louis   but later, under pressure from Parliament and with a coalition with the Catholic French no longer politically favourable, he approved the union. Pressured by Parliament, the Duke of York agreed to the marriage, falsely assuming that it would improve his popularity amongst Protestants. The first cousins Mary and William married in London on 4 November 1677; Mary reportedly wept throughout the ceremony.


Mary went to the Netherlands, where she lived as William's consort. Although she was devoted to her husband, the marriage was often unhappy; her three pregnancies ended in miscarriage or stillbirth, and her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in Mary's life. Her animated and personable nature made her popular with the Dutch people, but her husband was often cold and neglectful, and long maintained an affair with Elizabeth Villiers, one of Mary's ladies-in-waiting, though over time he became more relaxed in Mary's company.

The Glorious Revolution.

Upon the death of Charles II without legitimate issue in 1685, the Duke of York became King as James II in England and Ireland, and as James VII in Scotland. He had a controversial religious policy; his attempt to grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans was not well-received, as the technique he chose was to annul acts of Parliament by royal decree. Several Protestant politicians and noblemen entered into negotiations with Mary's husband as early as 1687. After James took the step of forcing Anglican clergymen to read the Declaration of Indulgence the proclamation granting religious liberty to dissenters from their churches in May 1688, his popularity plunged. Alarm amongst Protestants increased when his wife, Queen Mary, gave birth to a son James Francis Edward in June 1688, for the son would, unlike Mary and Anne, be raised a Roman Catholic. Some charged that the boy was "supposititious", having been secretly smuggled in to  Queen's room in a bed-warming pan as a substitute for her stillborn baby. Although there was no evidence to support the allegation, Mary publicly challenged the boy's legitimacy, sending a pointed list of questions to her sister, Anne, regarding the circumstances of the birth.

On 30 June, the Immortal Seven secretly requested William then in the Netherlands with Mary to come to England with an army. At first, William was reluctant; he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared that she would become more powerful than he was. Mary, however, convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, telling him "she would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him king for life".
William agreed to invade and issued a declaration which referred to James' new-born son as the "pretended Prince of Wales". He also gave a list of grievences of the English people and stated that his proposed expedition was for the sole purpose of having "a free and lawful Parliament assembled". The Dutch army finally landed on 5 November, having been turned back by a storm in October. The disaffected English Army and Navy went over to William, and English people's confidence in James stood so low that they did not attempt to save their King. On 11 December, the defeated King attempted to flee, but was intercepted. A second attempt at flight, on 23 December, was successful: James escaped to France where he lived in exile until his death. 

Mary was upset by the circumstances surrounding the deposition of her father, but William ordered her to appear cheerful on their triumphant arrival in London. As a result she was criticised for appearing cold to her father's plight. James too wrote a diatribe against her criticising her disloyalty, an action which deeply affected the pious Mary.

In 1689, a Convention Parliament summoned by the Prince of Orange assembled, and much discussion relating to the appropriate course of action ensued. William of Orange felt insecure about his position; he wished to reign as a King, rather than function as a mere consort of a Queen. The only precedent for a joint monarchy dated from the sixteenth century: when Queen Mary I married the Spanish Prince Philip, it was agreed that the latter would take the title of King. But Philip II remained King only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, however, demanded that he remain King even after his wife's death. Although some prominent statesmen proposed to make her the sole ruler, Mary, remaining loyal to her husband, refused.

On 13 February 1689, Parliament passed the Declaration of Right, in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee on 11 December 1688, had abdicated the government of the realm, and that the Throne had thereby become vacant. Parliament offered the Crown not to James's eldest son, James Francis Edward (who would have been the heir-apparent under normal circumstances), but to William and Mary as joint Sovereigns. It was, however, provided that "the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives." The declaration was later extended to exclude not only James and his heirs from the throne, but all Catholics, since "it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince".

The Bishop of London, Henry Compton, crowned William and Mary together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689. Normally, the Archbishop of Canterbury performs coronations, but the Archbishop at the time, William Sancroft, although an Anglican, refused to recognise the validity of James II's removal. On the day of the coronation, the Convention of the Estates of Scotland   which was much more divided than the English Parliament   finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland. William and Mary were offered the separate Scottish Crown (the two kingdoms were not united until the Acts of Union in 1707); they accepted on 11 May.

Even after the declaration, there was still substantial support for James in Scotland. The Viscount of Dundee raised an army, and won a convincing victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses suffered by Dundee's troops, coupled with his fatal wounding at the start of the battle, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering a resounding defeat the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.

Reign.

In December 1689 Parliament passed one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure   which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right   established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also addressed the question of 
succession to the Throne.

Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.

From 1690 onwards, William often remained absent from England, at first fighting Jacobites in Ireland. Whilst her husband was away, Mary administered the government of the realm. She proved a firm ruler, ordering the arrest of her own uncle, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, for plotting to restore James II to the throne. In 1692, she dismissed and imprisoned the influential John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough on similar charges; the dismissal somewhat diminished her popularity and harmed her relationship with her sister Anne who was strongly influenced by Churchill's wife, Sarah. Anne appeared at court with Sarah, obviously supporting the disgraced Churchill, which led to Mary angrily demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah and vacate her lodgings. Mary later failed to visit Anne during her pregnancy and relations remained strained until Mary's death.

William had crushed the Irish Jacobites by 1692, but he continued with campaigns abroad in order to wage war against France in the Netherlands.  When her husband was away, Mary acted in her own name but on his advice; whilst he was in England, Mary completely refrained from interfering in political matters, as had been agreed in the Bill of Rights. She did, however, participate in the affairs of the Church - all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through her hands. She died of smallpox at Kensington Palace on the 28th December 1694 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Upon her death, baroque composer Henry Purcell of England was commissioned to write her funeral music, entitled Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary. The ominous March (catalogued as Z860 A) has subsequently been used in other media, such as the title theme in the movie A Clockwork Orange. William, who had grown increasingly to rely on Mary, was devastated by her death, reportedly said that "from being the happiest" he was "now going to be the miserablest creature on earth".

Legacy.
After Mary II's death, William III continued to rule as king. Princess Anne's last surviving child, William, Duke of Gloucester, died in July 1700, and, as it was clear that William III would have no more children, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that the Crown would go to the nearest Protestant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover and her Protestant heirs. When William III died in 1702, he was succeeded by Anne, and she in turn was succeeded by the son of the deceased Electress Sophia, George I.

Mary endowed the College of William and Mary (in the present day Williamsburg, Virginia) in 1693. She also founded the Royal Hospital for Seamen, Greenwich.

Style and arms.
The joint style of William III and Mary II was "William and Mary, by the Grace of God, King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc." when they ascended the Throne. (The claim to France was only nominal, and had been asserted by every English King since Edward III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled.) From 11 April, 1689   when the Estates of Scotland recognised them as Sovereigns   the royal couple used the style "William and Mary, by the Grace of God, King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc.".

The arms used by the King and Queen were: Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); overall an escutcheon Azure billetty and a lion rampant Or.

Sandgate is a coastal suburb in Brisbane, Australia located 16km north of the Brisbane CBD.

Geography.
Sandgate is situated on the coastline, along Moreton Bay.  It is connected to QR's Citytrain Network. 

Name.
The name of the area may have been inspired by Sandgate on the coast of county Kent, England. Sandgate in Kent had a military camp, Shorncliffe Camp, on top of the cliffs adjacent to it. Sandgate in Brisbane also has an adjacent suburb called Shorncliffe.

History.
Land in Sandgate became available in 1853, developing into a small settlement. The coming of the railway in 1882 promoted more rapid development of the Sandgate area. Travel to Brisbane by train could be completed in less than one half hour. Sandgate was declared a town by the Governor of Queensland in 1880. This new status meant a town council was formed to guide the development of the local area. Initially, the council chambers were located in Shorncliffe.  However, following a fire which destroyed the council chambers in 1910, a much larger town hall was opened in 1911.
  
The Sandgate Council, which operated from 1880 to 1924, had to provide a range of services for the growing community. These included a fire department, ambulance, and sanitation facilities, as well as maintaining roads and regulating local development. In 1925 Sandgate Council was amalgamated into the Brisbane City Council.

Sandgate boasted clean beaches that were a popular weekend destination, with thousands of people visiting from Brisbane to escape the heat.

<doc id="2626455" title="Cosimo Rosselli" nonfiltered="1171" processed="1156" dbindex="1481183">

Cosimo Rosselli (1439 - c. 1507) was a Italian painter.
Biography.
Born in Florence, at the age of fourteen he became a pupil of Neri di Bicci, and in 1460 he worked as assistant to his cousin Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli. The first work of Cosimo mentioned by Giorgio Vasari exists in Sant'Ambrogio, in Florence, over the third altar on the left. It is an Assumption of the Virgin, a youthful and feeble work. In the same church, on the wall of one of the chapels, is a fresco by Cosimo which Vasari praises highly, especially for a portrait of the young scholar Pico of Mirandola. The scene, a procession bearing a miracle-working chalice, is painted with much vigour and less mannerism than most of this artist's work. A picture painted by Rosselli for the church of the Annunziata, with figures of SS. Barbara, Matthew and the Baptist, is in the Academy of Florence.

Rosselli also spent some time in Lucca, where he painted several altar-pieces for various churches. A picture attributed to him, taken from the church of St. Girolamo at Fiesole, is now in the National Gallery of London. It is a large retable, with, in the center, St. Jerome in the wilderness kneeling before a crucifix, and at the sides standing figures of St. Damasus and St. Eusebius, St. Paula and St. Eustochium; below is a predella with small subjects. Though dry and hard in treatment, the figures are designed with much dignity. 

The Berlin Gallery possesses three pictures by Rosselli: The Virgin in Glory, The Entombment of Christ, and The Massacre of the Innocents. In 1480 Rosselli, together with the chief painters of Florence, was invited by Pope Sixtus IV to Rome to assist in the painting of the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. Three of these were executed by him The Destruction of Pharaohs Army in the Red Sea, Christ Preaching by the Lake of Tiberias, and The Last Supper. The last of these is well preserved, but is a mediocre work. Vasari's story about the pope admiring Rosselli's paintings more than those of his abler brother painters has probably little foundation. Rosselli's Sistine frescoes were partly painted by his assistant Piero di Cosimo, who was so called after Cosimo Rosselli. His chief pupil was Fra Bartolomeo. 

According to Vasari, Rosselli died in 1484, but this is a mistake, as his is known to be living on 25 November 1506.

Gravmar & the Gravediggers is a Norwegian band, originating from Jæren and Bergen. Inventors of the genre "grave punk" and the "E-String Revolution". It's members are at the current time spread all over the world. The line-up is:

Turd Ferguson - lead singer;
Bonebreaker - guitar, backing vocals;
$id $ombie - e-string bass, backing vocals;
Doctor Gravmar - e-string random rhythm cowboy guitar;
The Bitch Slappin' Little One - drums;

Gravmar & the Gravediggers made their first appearance at the Hoggstock Festival 2003 (now called Ranglerock), located at Bryne, Norway. The band's ambition was to bring back punk rock to what it's all about: DIYmentality and energy instead of skills, as well as being an alternative to the music being played on radio every day. With only Bonebreaker as a proper musician (Doctor Gravmar and $id $ombie only use the e-string due to their incompetence) the band nontheless managed to compose three songs in time for the festival. These songs ended up on Gravmar & the Gravediggers first release: Penaltyfucking With A Cactus EP. A second release, Rich Bitch EP, followed in 2004.

The band has become a regular act at the Ranglerock Festival, appearing four years in a row. They have figured on the bill alongside names such as Mika Bomb and The Young Knives. Apart from this, Gravmar & the Gravediggers has made few live appearances. 

The first Gravmar & the Gravediggers album was released in 2006, called A Whole New Ballgame. Songs from this album has been played on radio podcasts all over the world, including Punky Radio and Rock Hell Radio. In Norway, the popular heavy metal show Pyro, broadcasted on national radio, played the Gravmar & the Gravediggers song Welcome To Pussyland several times throughout the autumn of 2006, making it a sort of cult underground hit. Norway's equivalent to John Peel, Harald Are Lund, played Holy Fuck on his weekly show.

Lyman Wiswell Gilmore, Jr. (June 11, 1874 - February 18, 1951) was an aviation pioneer. In Grass Valley, California, USA, he built a steam-powered airplane and claimed that he flew it on May 15, 1902. Due to the requirement of a heavy boiler and the dependency on coal as a power source, the flights would have only been short. Potential proofs of his claim were lost in a 1935 hangar fire.

 First flight .
An eccentric man, some people who remember him claim that Lyman Gilmore stank to high heaven, vowed to never cut his hair or beard, and wore a trench coat even in the middle of summer. The coat contained not only all of his papers but two pistols. 

Lyman built a steam-powered airplane and claimed that he flew it on May 15, 1902.

Any remaining proof he beat the Wright Brothers was lost when he was forcefully deprived of his trench coat for a delousing, and the coat was subsequently burned along with all the papers he carried in it.

There are photographs from 1898 showing Gilmore's machine, but none showing the plane in the air.

 Work .
Lyman Gilmore was in contact with other flight pioneers like Samuel Langley and, eventually, the Wright brothers.

In 1902, Gilmore was granted two patents on steam engines, the first of which was granted in 1902. He invented in other areas too, for example a rotary snowplow. On March 15, 1907, Gilmore opened the first commercial airfield, Gilmore Airfield, in Grass Valley.






After the fire in his hangar, Gilmore began mining for gold and died a poor man in Nevada City, California. His grave can be found in Pine Grove Cemetery, about a half mile outside of town.

Plot.

K'tano, First Prime of Imhotep, announces to rebel Jaffa that the Goa'uld are not gods and they shall fight for freedom. In the crowd, Teal'c and Bra'tac overhear his speech.

They report back to the SGC and tell them K'tano who holds strong to Jaffa ways against Tau'ri influence. However, this leader is incredibly reckless. In addition to attacking auspicious targets that contain civilians as well as Goa'uld, he uses terrorist tactics such as suicide bombers in order to spread dissent throughout the ranks of his enemies. SG-1 decides to make an alliance with them because the Tok'ra are weakened.

Upon arriving, they learn that K'tano is raiding Zipacna. When he came back, he praised SG-1 for killing the many System Lords. He then asks what SG-1 has to offer in exchange for an alliance. They show P90s and supplies. K'tano thinks it is generous but he was expecting Zats and Staffs. They do a weapons test and show the Jaffa that though their weapons are less advanced technologically, they are supirior in battle. This earns K'tano trust.

Next day, they raided one of Nirrti's cargo ships and K'tano convinces her Jaffa to come to their cause. O'Neill thought that was pretty suicidal in walking up to the enemy's servants.

Teal'c leads an attack on Lord Yu at the behest of K'tano, along with several other rebel Jaffa to destroy the "weak" System Lord. Teal'c is captured and the other rebel Jaffa are killed. For his own reasons, Lord Yu decides to let Teal'c go, but first he tells him that the attempted mutiny on one of Yu's motherships has failed and something else. Teal'c comes back through the Stargate and heads to the Jaffa camp to challenge K'tano to Jo'ma'sai'que, the Jaffa rite of leadership. Teal'c feigns exhaustion until K'tano thinks him beaten, at which point he gloats in Teal'c's ear. In doing so, he reveals himself as Imhotep, a minor Goa'uld. K'tano/Imhotep raises his staff for a killing blow, leaving himself open for Teal'c to utilise a quick jab with his broken staff. The jab kills Imhotep, and one of the rebel Jaffa confirms that he is not a Jaffa. The Goa'uld mothership begins its attack, and the Jaffa flee to the relative safety of Earth with SG-1. Bra'tac vowed that their day will come.

Quotes.

Jack: This up a staff weapon is a weapon of terror: it's made to intimidate the enemy. This up a P90 is a weapon of war: it's made to kill the enemy."

Alley Baggett (born July 14, 1973) is an American  nude model and actress. She was born and raised in Houston, Texas. Growing up in a small town, the Spanish, part Filipino girl was always active in extra-curricular activities. In junior high, Alley was involved in the dance team. While in high school, she was on the cheerleading squad, played basketball and participated in track.

Baggett burst onto the national scene in May 1995 when she appeared on the cover of Playboy's Book of Lingerie. She has since appeared on over twelve Playboy Special Edition covers and has made more appearances in Playboy Special Editions than almost any other model. She has also been featured in British lad mags FHM and Loaded.  Baggett originally aspired to be a traditional model, but was turned down because of her height (5'2").  It was not until she ran into famous photographer Harvey Butts in New York City that she got her big break.  Ms. Baggett currently runs her website, AlleyBaggett.net which features nude and erotic photographs and videos.

Outside of the modeling realm, Baggett has worked on television as a WWF Sunday Night Heat commentator on the USA Network and has appeared as herself on Penn and Teller's Sin City Spectacular, the WB's Unhappily Ever After, Telemundo's The Umberto Show and the Maria Conchita Alonso Show. She has also performed in music videos for Ricky Martin's  "Shake Your Bon-Bon" and Third Eye Blind's "Never Let You Go".  Ms. Baggett was also featured in a Comic Book series based on a crime fighting alter-ego, "Alley Cat".  The comic books spawned action figures of Ms. Baggett, which are today considered collectors' items.  She has also been featured and interviewed in various car tuning magazines, as Ms. Baggett owns a modified Mazda RX-7.  

Alley is famous for her breasts, notable not only for their surgically enhanced size  but also for her prominent glands of Montgomery which are clearly visible in zoom shots of her areolae. 

According to her website, Baggett enjoys rock climbing, snowboarding and weightlifting, as well as riding her bike on the beach.  She is currently planning for her post-modeling career, having started her own production company.

A psychological contract represents the mutual beliefs, perceptions, and informal obligations between an employer and an employee. It sets the dynamics for the relationship and defines the detailed practicality of the work to be done. It is distinguishable from the formal written contract of employment which, for the most part, only identifies mutual duties and responsibilities in a generalized form.

Captiva Island is an island in Lee County in southwest Florida, located just offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Originally part of neighboring Sanibel Island to the southeast, it was likely severed when a hurricane's storm surge washed away a new channel, called Blind Pass, which has now been filled in with sand. Like Sanibel, Captiva is a barrier island to Pine Island (to the east of Captiva and north of Sanibel), however it is much narrower. The only automobile access to Captiva is via the Sanibel Causeway and Sanibel-Captiva Road.

North Captiva Island or Upper Captiva is another island, in turn severed from Captiva in a 1921 hurricane, creating Redfish Pass. North Captiva has power from lines that originate on the north end of Captiva, and is privately owned. With about 300 homes built and 300 vacant lots, the island is about half way to build out. Since the island can be accessed by boat or small plane only, North Captiva real estate values are generally lower than on Captiva.


Captiva was seriously damaged in August 2004 when the eastern eyewall of Hurricane Charley struck North Captiva, immediately before hitting Charlotte Harbor to the north-northeast. Initial reports indicated that 160 buildings were destroyed and another 160 seriously damaged. The storm surge cut a path 400 yards or 365 meters wide across the narrowest part of North Captiva, making it two separate islands. The new pass has not been formally named, but the locals call it "Charley Pass" or "The North Cap Gap".

According to local folklore, Captiva got its name because the pirate captain José Gaspar (Gasparilla) held his female prisoners on the island for ransom or worse.
Captiva is the part time home of many famous people and the full-time home of world renowned artist Robert Rauschenberg. 
South Seas Plantation Resort and Yacht Harbor, a 330 acre resort, resides on the northern two miles of Captiva Island.

<doc id="1120408" title="Hawker Nimrod" nonfiltered="1183" processed="1168" dbindex="1481195">
This article is about a 1930s fighter aircraft. For the 1960s maritime patrol aircraft, see Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod.;

The Hawker Nimrod was a British carrier-based fighter aircraft built between World War I and WW2. It was developed from the earlier Hawker Norn, with the first production Nimrod Mk1s entering service in 1933 with No. 801 Squadron, No. 802 Squadron and No. 803 Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm. The Nimrod Mk II followed these in September 1934, possessing arrestor gear, more powerful engines, and increased area tail surfaces.

One aircraft was supplied to Japan, one to Portugal, and two went to Denmark, where they were known as the Nimrodderne.

The Nimrod arose out of the need for more modern aircraft within the Royal Navy. By 1932 such was the state of the Navy's Fleet Air Arm, that its principal fighter, the Fairey Flycatcher had become so obsolete in terms of its speed, that RAF officers often joked that a spritely fly might actually give the plane a run for its money. As a result the air ministry put out a tender for a new naval fighter. The Nimrod, like its land-based counterpart the Hawker Fury, was amongst the latest in a long line of fighters dating back to the Sopwith designs which fought in World War One. Designed by Sidney Camm, who would later go on the design the Hawker Hurricane, Typhoon, and Tempest, the Nimrod followed the standard design philosophy of the time in being a single-seater biplane with open cockpit, fixed undercarriage, and twin machine guns using interruptor gear to fire through the propellor. With a top speed of 193 mph it was a vast improvement over the Flycatcher, though marginally slower than the Hawker Fury. Like that aircraft however it had been replaced by more modern designs such as the Gloster Sea Gladiator by the time war was declared.

Variants.
 Nimrod Mk I : Single-seat fighter aircraft for the Royal Navy. Powered by a 477-hp (356-kW) Rolls-Royce Kestrel II MS piston engine.
 Nimrod Mk II : Single-seat fighter aircraft for the Royal Navy. Powered by a 608-hp Rolls-Royce Kestrel V piston engine.
 Nimrodderne : Single-seat fighter aircraft for the Royal Danish Navy.

Electronic mail (abbreviated "e-mail" or, often, "email") is a store and forward method of composing, sending, storing, and receiving messages over electronic communication systems. The term "e-mail" (as a noun or verb) applies both to the Internet e-mail system based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and to intranet systems allowing users within one organization to e-mail each other. Often these workgroup collaboration organizations may use the Internet protocols for internal e-mail service.

Origins of e-mail.
E-mail predates the Internet; existing e-mail systems were a crucial tool in creating the Internet. 
MIT first demonstrated the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) in 1961.

It allowed multiple users to log into the IBM 7094

from remote dial-up terminals, and to store files online on disk. This new ability encouraged users to share information in new ways. 
E-mail started in 1965 as a way for multiple users of a time-sharing mainframe computer to communicate. Although the exact history is murky, among the first systems to have such a facility were SDC's Q32 and MIT's CTSS.

E-mail was quickly extended to become network e-mail, allowing users to pass messages between different computers. The messages could be transferred between users on different computers by 1966, but it is possible the SAGE system had something similar some time before.

The ARPANET computer network made a large contribution to the evolution of e-mail. There is one report  which indicates experimental inter-system e-mail transfers on it shortly after its creation, in 1969. Ray Tomlinson initiated the use of the @ sign to separate the names of the user and their machine in 1971 . The ARPANET significantly increased the popularity of e-mail, and it became the killer app of the  ARPANET.

Modern Internet e-mail.
How Internet e-mail works.


The diagram above shows a typical sequence of events that takes place when Alice composes a message using her mail user agent (MUA). She types in, or selects from an address book, the e-mail address of her correspondent. She hits the "send" button.
 Her MUA formats the message in Internet e-mail format and uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send the message to the local mail transfer agent (MTA), in this case smtp.a.org, run by Alice's Internet Service Provider (ISP).
 The MTA looks at the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header), in this case bob@b.org. An Internet e-mail address is a string of the form localpart@domain.example, which is known as a Fully Qualified Domain Address (FQDA). The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address, often the username of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a domain name. The MTA looks up this domain name in the Domain Name System to find the mail exchange servers accepting messages for that domain.
 The DNS server for the b.org domain, ns.b.org, responds with an MX record listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case mx.b.org, a server run by Bob's ISP.

 smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP, which delivers it to the mailbox of the user bob.
 Bob presses the "get mail" button in his MUA, which picks up the message using the Post Office Protocol (POP3).

This sequence of events applies to the majority of e-mail users. However, there are many alternative possibilities and complications to the e-mail system:

 Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate e-mail system, such as IBM's Lotus Notes or Microsoft's Exchange. These systems often have their own internal e-mail format and their clients typically communicate with the e-mail server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives e-mail via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate e-mail system.
 Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service.
 Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1.
 Bob may pick up his e-mail in many ways, for example using the Internet Message Access Protocol, by logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.
 Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail when the main mail exchange server is not available.
 Emails are not secure if email encryption is not used correctly.

It used to be the case that many MTAs would accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called open mail relays. This was important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable. If an MTA couldn't reach the destination, it could at least deliver it to a relay that was closer to the destination. The relay would have a better chance of delivering the message at a later time. However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by people sending unsolicited bulk e-mail and as a consequence very few modern MTAs are open mail relays, and many MTAs will not accept messages from open mail relays because such messages are very likely to be spam.

Note that the people, e-mail addresses and domain names in this explanation are fictional: see Alice and Bob.

Internet e-mail format.
The format of Internet e-mail messages is defined in RFC 2822 and a series of RFCs, RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). Although as of July 13 2005 (see ) RFC 2822 is technically a proposed IETF standard and the MIME RFCs are draft IETF standards, these documents are the de facto standards for the format of Internet e-mail. Prior to the introduction of RFC 2822 in 2001 the format described by RFC 822 was the de facto standard for Internet e-mail for nearly two decades; it is still the official IETF standard. The IETF reserved the numbers 2821 and 2822 for the updated versions of RFC 821 (SMTP) and RFC 822, honoring the extreme importance of these two RFCs. RFC 822 was published in 1982 and based on the earlier RFC 733.

Internet e-mail messages consist of two major sections:

 Header - Structured into fields such as summary, sender, receiver, and other information about the e-mail;
 Body - The message itself as unstructured text; sometimes containing a signature block at the end;

The header is separated from the body by a blank line.

Internet e-mail header.
The message header consists of fields, usually including at least the following:
 From: The e-mail address, and optionally name, of the sender of the message;
 To: The e-mail address, and optionally name, of the receiver of the message;
 Subject: A brief summary of the contents of the message;
 Date: The local time and date when the message was originally sent;

Each header field has a name and a value. RFC 2822 specifies the precise syntax. Informally, the field name starts in the first character of a line, followed by a ":", followed by the value which is continued on non-null subsequent lines that have a space or tab as their first character. Field names and values are restricted to 7-bit ASCII characters. Non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words. 

Note that the "To" field in the header is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The actual delivery list is supplied in the SMTP protocol, not extracted from the header content. The "To" field is similar to the greeting at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. Also note that the "From" field does not have to be the real sender of the e-mail message. It is very easy to fake the "From" field and let a message seem to be from any mail address. It is possible to digitally sign e-mail, which is much harder to fake. Some Internet service providers do not relay e-mail claiming to come from a domain not hosted by them, but very few (if any) check to make sure that the person or even e-mail address named in the "From" field is the one associated with the connection. Some internet service providers apply e-mail authentication systems to e-mail being sent through their MTA to allow other MTAs to detect forged spam that might apparently appear to be from them.

Other common header fields include:

 Cc: carbon copy;
 Received: Tracking information generated by mail servers that have previously handled a message;
 Content-Type: Information about how the message has to be displayed, usually a MIME type;

Many e-mail clients present "Bcc" (Blind carbon copy, recipients not visible in the "To" field) as a header field. Since the entire header is visible to all recipients, "Bcc" is not included in the message header. Addresses added as "Bcc" are only added to the SMTP delivery list, and do not get included in the message data.

IANA maintains a list of standard header fields.

E-mail content encoding.
E-mail was originally designed for 7-bit ASCII. Much e-mail software is 8-bit clean but must assume it will be communicating with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The MIME standard introduced charset specifiers and two content transfer encodings to encode 8 bit data for transmission: quoted printable for mostly 7 bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data. The 8BITMIME extension was introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings but many mail transport agents still don't support it fully. For international character sets, Unicode is growing in popularity.

Saved message filename extension.
Most, but not all, e-mail clients save individual messages as separate files, or allow users to do so.  Different applications save e-mail files with different filename extensions.
.eml;
This is the default e-mail extension for Mozilla Thunderbird and is used by Microsoft Outlook Express.
.emlx;
Used by Apple Mail.
.msg;
Used by Microsoft Office Outlook.

Messages and mailboxes.
Messages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software like Sendmail. Users can download their messages from servers with standard protocols such as the POP or IMAP protocols, or, as is more likely in a large corporate environment, with a proprietary protocol specific to Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers.

Mail can be stored either on the client, on the server side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox. Several prominent e-mail clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer e-mail between them.

When a message cannot be delivered, the recipient MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender, indicating the problem.

Spamming and e-mail worms.
The usefulness of e-mail is being threatened by three phenomena: spamming, phishing and e-mail worms. 

Spamming is unsolicited commercial e-mail. Because of the very low cost of sending e-mail, spammers can send hundreds of millions of e-mail messages each day over an inexpensive Internet connection. Hundreds of active spammers sending this volume of mail results in information overload for many computer users who receive tens or even hundreds of junk messages each day.

E-mail worms use e-mail as a way of replicating themselves into vulnerable computers. Although the first e-mail worm affected UNIX computers, the problem is most common today on the more popular Microsoft Windows operating system.

The combination of spam and worm programs results in users receiving a constant drizzle of junk e-mail, which reduces the usefulness of e-mail as a practical tool.

A number of anti-spam techniques mitigate the impact of spam. In the United States, U.S. Congress has also passed a law, the Can Spam Act of 2003, attempting to regulate such e-mail. Australia also has very strict spam laws restricting the sending of spam from an Australian ISP (http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd045.pdf), but its impact has been minimal since most spam comes from regimes that seem reluctant to regulate the sending of spam.

Privacy problems regarding e-mail.


E-mail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because

 e-mail messages are generally not encrypted;
 e-mail messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages;
 many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of your e-mail messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain up to several months on their server, even if you delete them in your mailbox;
 the Received: headers and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.

There are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above.  For example, Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG, PGP or S/MIME can be used for end-to-end message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.

Another risk is that e-mail passwords might be intercepted during sign-in.
One may use encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL to help prevent this.

Heybridge is a small town adjacent to Maldon, near the River Blackwater in Essex, England. It is often overshadowed by its historic neighbour, and one could mistakenly think it to be the same town, as the two have merged with one another over the years.

Heybridge has a number of residential areas, most recognisably the newer Bovis housing estates to the west of the town, which were built in 1995. Before building commenced, a full archaealogical dig was undertaken and an entire Roman village was unearthed. Along the Goldhanger road are situated a number of traditional British holiday campsites, catering for both permanent residents and visitors.

Facilities.
Heybridge's facilities include a number of takeaways (Paul's Place, Best Kebab and Copsey's Fish Restaurant), two small supermarkets, a video shop, chemist and dentist; all are situated around the Bentall's Shopping Complex along the Colchester Road. The town is also home to the popular Heybridge Swifts football club, currently competing in the Isthmian League Premier Division.

Heybridge Basin.
Another notable feature is  Heybridge Basin, a picturesque area where the River Chelmer navigation merges into the saline River Blackwater. The two rivers are joined by a lock which is regularly used by pleasure boats. There are two pubs adjacent to the lock (The Old Ship Inn and The Jolly Sailor) which provide traditional British food. There is also a small tea room operated by the world renowned Wilkin and Sons conserves company. The basin offers bracing and pleasant walks along the seawall, or alternatively one can follow the canal leading back into the heart of Heybridge town. During the summer months, rowing boat hire is also available at a small price.

Sports and recreation.

Heybridge has a King George's Field in memorial to King George V

The SS Bull Run was a type T2 tanker built at Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. in Chester, PA as hull number 287 and USMC number 362 in 1943.  In 1956, the ship was acquired by the US Navy from the Maritime Administration, assigned to MSTS, and placed in-service as the USNS Bull Run (T-AO-156).  It left the navy in 1957, going back to the Maritime Administration.  In 1969, the stern of the Bull Run was attached to the bow of the Type C4 ship the Anchorage, and the completed ship then retained the name Anchorage.  The bow the the Bull Run was then scrapped.

<doc id="232940" title="War on Poverty" nonfiltered="1190" processed="1175" dbindex="1481202">


The War on Poverty was first introduced by Lyndon B. Johnson during his State of the Union address on January 8, 1964.  Legislation proposed by Johnson was designed in response to the poverty of over 35 million Americans that year and followed difficult economic conditions associated with a national poverty rate of around 19%.  The War on Poverty speech led Congress to pass the Economic Opportunity Act, a law that established the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to administrate the local application of Federal funds targeted against poverty.

As a part of the Great Society, Johnson's view of a federally directed application of resources to expand the government's role in social welfare programs from education to healthcare was a continuation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal and Four Freedoms speech from the 1930s and 1940s. 

The concept of a war on poverty waned after the 1960s. Deregulation, growing criticism of the welfare state, and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, that Bill Clinton claimed "end welfare as we know it".  Nonetheless, the legacy of the War on Poverty remains in the continued existence of such Federal Programs as Head Start and Job Corps.

Background.

This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America.

Michael Harrington's book The Other America, 1962, is sometimes credited with being a catalyst in this moment.

 Major initiatives .

 Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 -- August 20, 1964;
 Social Security Act of 1965 -- July 30, 1965;

The Office of Economic Opportunity was the agency responsible for administering most of the War on Poverty programs created during United States President Lyndon B. Johnson's Administration, including VISTA, Job Corps, Head Start (though that program was later transferred to the Department of Health Education and Welfare), Legal Services and the Community Action Program. The OEO was established in 1964 and quickly became a target of both left-wing and right-wing critics of the War on Poverty. Directors of the OEO included Sargent Shriver, Bertrand Harding, and Donald Rumsfeld.

The OEO launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965.  The project was designed to help end poverty by providing preschool children from low-income families with a program that would meet emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.  Head Start was then transferred to the Office of Child Development in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (later the Department of Health and Human Services) by the Nixon Administration in 1969. 

The Job Corps trains disadvantaged and at-risk youth and has provided more than 2 million disadvantaged young people with the integrated academic, vocational, and social skills training they need to gain independence and get quality, long-term jobs or further their education. Job Corps continues to help 70,000 youths annually at 122 Job Corps centers throughout the country.  Besides vocational training, many Job Corps also offers GED programs as well as high school diplomas and programs to get students into college.

 Criticisms .

President Johnson's 'War on Poverty' speech was delivered at a time of recovery (the poverty level had fallen from 22.4% in 1959 to 19% in 1964 when the War on Poverty was announced) and it was viewed by critics as an effort to get the United States Congress to authorize social welfare programs. Many economists such as Milton Friedman have argued that Johnson's policies actually had a negative impact on the economy due to their interventionist nature. Economists such as these recommend that the best way to fight poverty is not through government welfare but through economic growth.

 Results and legacy .

In the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty, poverty rates in the U.S. dropped to 11.1% and has remained between 11 and 15% ever since.  Since 1973 poverty has remained well below the historical U.S. averages in the range of 20-25%. 

Poverty among Americans between ages 18-64 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 to 16.3% today. The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.

In 2004, more than 35.9 million, or 12% of Americans including 12.1 million children, were considered to be living in poverty with an average growth of almost 1 million per year.

The OEO was dismantled by President Nixon in 1973, though many of the agency's programs were transferred to other government agencies.

According to the Readers' Companion to U.S. Women's History,
"Many observers point out that the War on Poverty's attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s."

 Historical notes .
The U.S. government continues to use the antiquated Orshansky measure of the poverty line, a measure which is only adjusted for inflation, and not adjusted for the actual cost of living against median income. In the 1960s the average cost of living was 30% of individual income, though in recent years the cost of living averages to 50% of household income. Because of this skew in measuring the poverty line some believe that the current U.S. census statistics published could actually be closer to 50 million Americans.

<doc id="2155855" title="Dolby Digital Plus" nonfiltered="1191" processed="1176" dbindex="1481203">
Dolby Digital Plus (DD+), also known as E-AC-3, was developed specifically for the introduction of HDTV and HD DVD/Blu-ray Disc. The codec supports coded-bitstream rates up to 6.144 Mbit/s, compared to 640 kbit/s for the original Dolby Digital AC-3, and can carry up to 13.1 channels in a single stream. 
The algorithm is not directly backward compatible with AC-3   existing AC-3 decoders will not be able to decode E-AC-3 streams   but DD+ capable equipment is required to be able to convert E-AC-3 streams to 640 kilobits per second AC-3 for compatibility with existing Dolby Digital A/V processors. 

Codec changes.
The codec used by Dolby digital plus is based on the original AC-3 codec, but with several enhancements to improve coding efficency:
 Transient pre-noise processing - to reduce "pre-noise" artifacts before sharp transients.
 Enhanced channel coupling - which maintains phase relationships between channels, and improves performance of matrix decoders.
 Adaptive hybrid transform processing - an improved bit allocation and quantization algorithm.

Dolby claims that these changes can result in bitrate improvements of up to 50% while still allowing for the signal to be converted to AC-3 for backwards compatibility.


Technical details.
Coded bitrate: 32 to 6144 kbit/s;
Audio Channels: up to 13.1;
Sample rate:  32, 44.1, 48, or 96 kHz ;
Bit depth: up to 24 bits per channel.

Physical transport .
As of 2006, HDMI 1.3 is the only means to transport a DD+ stream between two pieces of consumer equipment. The older and more widespread S/PDIF-interface cannot provide the sufficient bandwidth for a DD+ stream (up to 6144 kbit/s).  See the section below on downmixing.

HD DVD and Blu-ray.
Both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc support DD+.  The way DD+ is encoded in each format differs significantly.  
On HD DVD, DD+ is a mandatory audio-codec for both player-hardware and movie-software. This means that all HD DVD players are required to support DD+ decoding and output, and an HD DVD movie may use DD+ to deliver the primary (sole) soundtrack. The DD+ stream is stored as an independent, self-contained bitstream. HD DVD limits the peak bitrate to 3 Mbit/s.

HD DVD players must internally mix interactive audio with audio from the disc.  Therefore, current players are downmixing the content into commonly supported audio formats.  See the section on downmixing.

On Blu-ray Discs, DD+ is an optional audio-codec. On Blu-ray movies, if DD+ is present, it must be encoded as extensions to an existing legacy 640 kbit/s Dolby Digital bitstream (which must be present.) For 5.1 channel sound, the full DD+ stream consists of the DD stream plus a 1.024 Mbit/s 5.1 channel extension packet, for a total bitrate of 1.7 Mbit/s. In the future, Blu-ray may make use of up to four extension packets plus the Dolby Digital packet for a maximum of 4.7 Mbit/s.

The maximum number of discrete coded channels is the same for both formats: 7.1 

 Media players and Downmixing .
Due to the fact that there are few devices which accept DD+ over HDMI, and the fact that some media players (such as HD DVD players) have to mix interactive audio with audio from the disk, all players support downmixing from DD+ to a more commonly supported format.

Common downmix formats:
 Multi-channel analog audio;
 Bitstream (Dolby Digital or DTS);
 LPCM;

Bitstream data can be provided via a standard S/PDIF connection or HDMI.  LPCM is provided via HDMI.  Due to rapid changes in HDMI in the last few years, not all receivers and processors can handle audio over HDMI properly or at all.

<doc id="5606160" title="Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi" nonfiltered="1192" processed="1177" dbindex="1481204">
Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi (Arabic: ), possibly a Saudi Arabian, became wanted in 2002, by the United States Department of Justice's FBI, which was then seeking information about his identity and whereabouts. In early 2002, he had been named in a suspected Yemen plot, for which he became listed on the FBI's third major "wanted" list, now known as the FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list. No FBI photo was available. He was identified as a known associate of the Yemen cell leader, Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei. By March 21, 2002 he was removed from the FBI "wanted" list.  Very little else is known about him. 

USS Cole bombing.
On October 12, 2000, one year prior to 9/11, Yemen became an early theater in the War on Terrorism, when the 2000 USS Cole bombing killed 17 American sailors and wounded 40 off the port coast of Aden, Yemen.  In the aftermath, the government of Yemen rounded up numerous suspected terrorists, many of whom were identified as members of al-Qaeda.

February 12, 2002 terror alert.
In early 2002, according to an FBI report, as a result of US military operations in Afghanistan and of on-going interviews of detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, information became available on February 11, 2002 regarding threats to US interests which indicated that a planned attack may have been about to occur in the United States or against US interests in the country of Yemen on or around the next day, February 12, 2002. 

In response, on February 11, 2002, Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi became one of 17 suspected terrorists added by the FBI to the "Seeking Information" list. The early version of that list was then known as the "Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information" list. Years later, the FBI removed his profile from the main page of that list.  

On February 14, 2002, several days after the FBI alert, six of the names were removed, and the FBI re-published the list as only eleven names and photos, because it was discovered that confusion over transliteration had failed to reveal initially that the removed six wanted terrorists were already in prison in Yemen. 

The six names identified in the Yemen plot on February 11, 2002, but who were removed from the list on February 14, 2002 as already in Yemen custody were: Issam Ahmad Dibwan al-Makhlafi, Ahmad al-Akhader Nasser Albidani, Bashir Ali Nasser al-Sharari, Abdulaziz Muhammad Saleh bin Otash, Shuhour Abdullah Mukbil al-Sabri and  Riyadh Shikawi.

Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi remained listed among the eleven names still being sought on February 14, 2002.  The others who also remained were: Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei, Omar Ahmad Omar al-Hubishi, Ammar Abadah Nasser al-Wa'eli, Alyan Muhammad Ali al-Wa'eli, Bassam Abdullah bin Bushar al-Nahdi, Mustafa Abdulkader Aabed al-Ansari, Samir Abduh Sa'id al-Maktawi, Abdulrab Muhammad Muhammad Ali al-Sayfi, Abu Nasr al-Tunisi and Amin Saad Muhammad al-Zumari.

By March 21, 2002 three of those remaining eleven suspects (Tunisi, Jeddawi, and Zumari) had also been removed from the FBI list, leaving only eight wanted suspects from the Yemen plot still at large. 

2002 Yemen attacks and plots.
Whether foiled, aborted, or merely incorrect specific intelligence, the February 12, 2002 attack never occurred.  However, other attacks and plots in Yemen soon followed.

In April 2002, there was the detonation of explosives at a civil aviation authority building in Yemen.  

There was also an unsuccessful plot that year to kill the United States Ambassador in Yemen.  
 
In October 2002, two suicide bombers rammed an explosive-laden boat into the Limburg, a French oil tanker, killing a Bulgarian crew member and spilling 90,000 barrels of oil into the Gulf of Aden.  This operation was very similar to the attack on the American destroyer USS Cole two years earlier.  Saudi born Abdulraheem al-Nashiri, prime suspect of the USS Cole bombing (currently in the US custody), paid $40,000 to fund the Limburg attack.  With that money, the former Al Qaida leader Abu Ali al-Harithi bought the explosives and transported them from his house in Shabwa to Mukalla in Hadramut. Later in 2002, Al-Harithi was killed by the CIA with a missile fired from a Predator drone.

And then after the Limburg attack, there was an attack on a helicopter carrying Hunt Oil Co. employees in Yemen in November 2002.

Captures and trials.
After many of the suspects in those plots and attacks were caught,  trials began May 29, 2004 and centered on the October 2002 bombing of the Limburg.  

Seven were sentenced to 10 years in prison, including Fawzi Halabi and Abdulkareem Kaifan. 

Five of the militants Ibraheem Mohammed al-Huwaidi, Aref Saleh Ali Mujali, Mohammed Abdullah al-Dailami, Abdulghani Ali Hussein Kaifan and Kasem Yahia al-Raimee were sentenced to five years in prison. They were found guilty of plotting attacks against the US, French, UK, Cuban and German embassies, and plotting to assassinate the former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen.  One of the 15 accused was sentenced to death for killing a Yemeni police officer.

Mass escape from Yemen.
On February 3, 2006, 23 people, 12 of them al-Qaeda members,  escaped from a Yemeni jail, according to a BBC report.  They reportedly escaped by digging a tunnel.

It is not publicly known if any of the original six Yemen prisoners, who were first named and then removed from the "Seeking Information" list, were also connected to the 2006 mass al-Qaeda-related escape.  The FBI added several new names to the "wanted" lists, in response to the Yemen escape of 2006. However, none of the 17 Yemen plot suspects from the 2002 terror alert appeared again among the new FBI names.  

The current status of Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi remains unknown to the public.  Prior to 2006, he was completely removed from the FBI "wanted" list.

Vic Armstrong (born October 5, 1946) is a BAFTA and Academy Award-winning British stunt double, the world's most prolific according to the Guinness Book of Records.  The strapping, 6-foot Armstrong doubled for 6'1" Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones trilogy, 6'2" Timothy Dalton for Flash Gordon and 6'4" Christopher Reeve in Superman II.

Legend has it that he looked so much like Harrison Ford that crew members of the Indiana Jones trilogy were constantly mistaking him for Ford. This proved useful when Ford injured his back and had to sit out for filming crucial action sequences in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) and Armstrong filled in for him. Indeed the stunt where he jumps from a horse on to a German tank was voted one of the Top Ten film stunts of all time by a panel of experts and Sky Movies viewers in the UK in 2002. On a private photograph taken on the film set, Harrison infamously wrote, "If you learn to talk Vic, I'm in deep trouble!"

Ronald "Ronnie" MacKinley is a Prince Edward Island Liberal politician, and a current member of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island.

Before running for office, MacKinley worked as a farmer in Cornwall, Prince Edward Island.  Apart from owning and operating his own personal farm, he co-owns MacKinley Brothers beef farm with his mother and his son.  He is married, and has three children, and two grandchildren.

MacKinley has served as vice-chair of the Elliot River CIC; as a director of the P.E.I. Federation of Agriculture and of the P.E.I. Farm Centre.  In addition to this, he is a former member of the Canadian Horticultural Council Labour Board and Uniform Legislation Board, as well as a former Queens County Chair for the P.E.I. Potato Producers' Association.  

MacKinley has enjoyed a long political career, especially for a Canadian politician who has never served in Cabinet.  He was first elected to represent the riding of North River-Rice Point in a 1985 by-election, and has served continuously ever since, for a career of more than 20 years.  He is easily the longest-serving member of the current Legislature.  In the 2003 election, MacKinley had the second-largest margin of victory, and was also one of only two MLAs to have a victory margin of over 1000 votes.

In the 2000 provincial election, MacKinley was the sole Liberal MLA elected, and also the only Opposition MLA.  As a result of this, he served as Leader of the Opposition and de facto Liberal leader until 2003, when he was replaced in both capacities by Robert Ghiz.  MacKinley is currently the Opposition Critic for Transportation and Public Works, Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture; he is also the Chairman of the important Public Accounts Committee of the legislature, which must always be chaired by a member of the Opposition.

<doc id="8909484" title="D'Arcy, British Columbia" nonfiltered="1198" processed="1183" dbindex="1481210">
D'Arcy is an unincorporated community in the Canadian province of British Columbia, approximately 150 kilometres northeast of the city of Vancouver.  Located at the head of Anderson Lake, D'Arcy, also known as Nequatque or N'quat'qua in the St'at'imcets (Lillooet) language, is partly a recreational and resource community and also the territory and residential area of the N'quatqua First Nation.  

History.

The Lakes Route.

D'Arcy was founded as a non-native community named Port Anderson during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-1859, when it became one of the major ports of the Douglas Road, a.k.a. the "Lakes Route", which connected to the upper Fraser Canyon from the lower Fraser via a series of portages and lake transport.  Steamers and other watercraft ran Anderson Lake from D'Arcy to the foot of the lake at Seton Portage (then known as Short Portage) a short 3 kllometre portage to Seton Lake, and from the foot of that lake another 5 kilometres to the trail's destination, the boomtown of Cayoosh Flat, which is today's town of Lillooet.  The name D'Arcy was conferred on the settlement, which after the gold rush reverted to near-entirely First Nations population only, at the time of the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, when non-native settlers once again took up land in the area, including a general store and a set of cabins by the lakeshore.  The longtime proprietress of the store at D'Arcy, Irene Edwards, wrote a history of the entire region surrounding D'Arcy, as well as the town and its native people, in her self-published Short Portage to Lillooet.

Japanese relocatees and Devine.

Nearby McGillivray Falls, a small resort a few miles down Anderson Lake via the railway, became one of the handful of relocation centres for Japanese expelled from the Coast during the Second World War.  D'Arcy at that time was just inside the 100 mile "quarantine" zone from the Coast beyond which all Japanese had to be evacuated, but because the D'Arcy-Birken valley (known as the Gates Valley or Birken Valley) and the Pemberton Valley in those times had no road access to the Coast, its physical isolation made regulations placed on the Japanese somewhat lax in comparison to the internment camps in the Kootenays.  Because of this situation, D'Arcy local Frank Devine was able to hire the relocated Japanese men, and brought them to work at a logging camp and mill two miles up the Gates River from D'Arcy, which has ever since been known as Devine.

Facilities.

There is a gas station, store and post office adjacent to the rail station, as well as a few public cabins for recreational rentals and a public beach with boatramp and some camping.  The N'quat'qua First Nation government offices also feature a community hall, school and other community services.

Each court of appeals consists of at least one county, and the number of judges in each district varies from four to twelve.  Each case is heard by a three-judge panel. The are currently 68 courts of appeals judges as provided by statute.  A court of appeals judge is an elected position, with terms of six years.  The Ohio Supreme Court has the discretion to review cases from the courts of appeals, but generally the appeals process in Ohio ends with the decision of the court of appeals.

"Providing the Balance of Power. Ontario Hydro's Plan to Serve Customers' Electricity Needs" is a massive 4-volume 1989 study to the year 2014 by Ontario Hydro, the supplier of electric power for the province of Ontario, Canada. The general public of Ontario was provided with copies of this report free of charge, and requested for feedback.

Overview.
The report explains why Ontario needs an electricity plan. It analyzes the people using electricity, a flexible system for serving customers, priority resources to meet needs, choosing the best major supply options, finding a balanced solution, and it adds a glossary about electricity.

Demand/Supply Plan Report.
This report, in colour, with tables and graphs, goes into details on the amount of electricity that will be expected to be demanded from the electricity supply system every year until 2014, and shows how much additional generating capacity will have to be provided to meet that demand. For example on page 3-15 is a table showing that, as an estimate, there is only a 10% probability that less than 28.6 gigawatts (GW) will be needed as peak in 2005, 29.0 GW in 2006, 29.6 GW in 2007, ... and 33.5 GW in 2014. The report goes into great details about what the needs are, defines resources, and examines various alternative plans (How much nuclear? Fossil fuel? Minimum pollution? Least expensive? Matters of politics? etc.) to ensure sufficient electricity will be available when it will be needed in Ontario, considering not only the additional demand, but also the listed expected retirements before 2015 of older generating facilities.

Appendix A is about strategy (March 1989), Appendix B provides a list of references, and Appendix C is a glossary, including commonly used acronyms.

Actual Peak Demand and prices up to July 15 2005.
The record, so far, was 26,170 megawatts (MW). Ontario had to purchase 3400 megawatts at up to seven times the normal rate, according to Metro of July 19 quoting the Torstar News Service, to meet the peak demand. Unfunded electricity debt so far is $20.6 billion, with Ontario's household consumers being charged only 5 cents per kilowatt hour for the first 750 kilowatt hours, and only 5.8 cents for the remainder. The price of imported power had risen to nearly 39 cents a kilowatt hour, while it normally is in the 5 to 10 cent range.

<doc id="209963" title="Fluid bearing" nonfiltered="1204" processed="1189" dbindex="1481216">
Fluid bearings are bearings which solely support the bearing's loads on a thin layer of liquid or gas.

They can be broadly classified as fluid dynamic bearings, hydrostatic or gas bearings. They are frequently used in high load, high speed or high precision applications where ordinary ball bearings have short life or high noise and vibration.  They are also used increasingly to reduce cost.  For example, hard disk drive motor fluid bearings are both quieter and cheaper than the ball bearings they replace.

Operation.

Fluid bearings use a thin layer of liquid or gas fluid between the bearing faces, typically sealed around or under the rotating shaft.

There are two principal ways of getting the fluid in to the bearing.

In gas bearings and hydrostatic bearings, the fluid is pumped in through an orifice or through a porous material.

In hydrodynamic bearings, the bearing rotation sucks the fluid on to the inner surface of the bearing, forming a lubricating wedge under or around the shaft.

Hydrostatic bearings rely on an external pump.  The power for that pump is arguably part of overall bearing friction.  Better seals can reduce leak rates and pumping power, but may increase friction.

Hydrodynamic bearings rely on bearing motion to suck fluid in to the bearing and may have high friction and short life at low speeds or during starts and stops. Thus, a secondary bearing may be used for startup and shutdown to prevent damage to the hydrodynamic bearing. A secondary bearing may have high friction and short operating life, but good overall service life if bearing starts and stops are infrequent.

Characteristics and principles of operation.

Fluid bearings can be relatively cheap compared to other bearings with a similar load rating.  The bearing can be as simple as two smooth surfaces with seals to keep in the working fluid. In contrast, a conventional bearing may require many high-precision rollers with complicated shapes. Hydrostatic and gas bearings do have the complication and expense of external pumps.

Most fluid bearings require little or no maintenance, and have almost unlimited life. Conventional mechanical ball bearings usually have shorter life and require regular maintenance. Pumped hydrostatic and aerostatic (gas) bearing designs retain low friction down to zero speed and need not suffer start/stop wear, provided the pump does not fail.

Fluid bearings generally have very low friction -- far better than mechanical bearings.  One source of friction in a fluid bearing is the viscosity of the fluid. Hydrostatic gas bearings are among the lowest friction bearings.  However, lower fluid viscosity also typically means fluid leaks faster from the bearing surfaces, thus requiring increased power for pumps or seals.

Since no rigid mechanical element supports load, it may seem fluid bearings can give only low precision.  In practice, fluid bearings have clearances that change less under load (are "stiffer") than mechanical bearings.  It might seem that bearing stiffness, as with maximum design load, would be a simple function of average fluid pressure and the bearing surface area.  In practice, when bearing surfaces are pressed together, the fluid outflow is greatly constricted. This significantly increases the pressure of the fluid between the bearing faces.  As fluid bearings faces are comparatively large areas, even small fluid pressure differences cause large restoring forces, maintaining the gap.

It is also very difficult to make a mechanical bearing which is atomically smooth and round; and mechanical bearings deform in high-speed operation due to centripetal force.  In contrast, fluid-bearings self-correct for minor imperfections. 

Fluid bearings are typically quieter and smoother (more consistent friction) than mechanical bearings.  For example, hard disks manufactured with fluid bearings have noise ratings for bearings/motors on the order of 20-24 dB, which is a little more than the background noise of a quiet room.  Drives based on rolling-element bearings are typically at least 4 dB noisier.

Some fluid bearings.
Foil bearings.



Foil bearings are a type of air bearing that was introduced in turbine applications in the 1960s by Garrett AiResearch.  They use a gas as the working fluid, usually air.

Journal bearings.

Pressure-oiled journal bearings appear to be plain bearings but are arguably fluid bearings.  For example, journal bearings in gasoline (petrol) and diesel engines pump oil at low pressure in to a large-gap area of the bearing.  As the bearing rotates, oil is carried in to the working part of the bearing, where it is compressed, with oil viscosity preventing the oil's escape.  As a result, the bearing "hydroplanes" on a layer of oil, rather than on metal-on-metal contact as it may appear.  

This is an example of a hydrodynamic bearing which does not use a secondary bearing for start/stop.  In this application, a large part of the bearing wear occurs during startup and shutdown, though in engine use, substantial wear is also caused by hard combustion contaminants that bridge the oil film.

Hockey.

Air hockey is a game based on an aerostatic bearing which suspends the puck and player's paddles to provide low friction and thus fast motion. The bearing uses a flat plane with periodic orifices which deliver air just over ambient pressure. The puck and paddles rest on air.

One part of ice hockey is ice skating. Ice skates are a hydrodynamic fluid bearing where the skate and ice are separated by a layer of water caused by entropy (formerly thought to be caused by pressure-induced melting; see ice skating for details).

Kingsbury/Michell tilting-pad fluid bearings.

Kingsbury/Michell dynamic tilting-pad fluid bearings were invented independently and almost simultaneously by both the American tribologist Albert Kingsbury, and a British-born Australian, Anthony George Maldon Michell.

The bearing has "shoes" or "pads" on pivots.  When the bearing is in operation, the rotating part of the bearing carries fresh oil in to the pad area.  Fluid pressure causes the pad to tilt slightly, building a wedge of pressurised fluid between the shoe and the other bearing surface.  The pad tilt adaptively changes with bearing load and speed.  Various design details ensure continued replenishment of the oil to avoid overheating and pad damage.

Kingsbury/Michell fluid bearings are used in a wider variety of heavy-duty rotating equipment, including in hydroelectric plants to support turbines and generators weighing hundreds of tons.  They are also used in very heavy machinery, such as submarine propeller shafts.

The first tilting pad bearing in service was probably that built under A.G.M. Michell's guidance by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd, for a centrifugal pump at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, in 1907, just two years after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to Reynold's equation. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first English ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamer the Paris, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War. The practical results were spectacular - the troublesome thrust block became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles. It was estimated that the Royal Navy saved coal to a value of £500,000 in 1918 alone as a result of fitting Michell's tilting-pad bearings.

According to the ASME (see reference link), the first Kingsbury/Michell fluid bearing in the USA was installed in the Holtwood Hydroelectric Power Plant (on the Susquehanna River, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA) in 1912.  The 2.25-tonne bearing supports a water turbine and electric generator with a rotating mass of about 165 tonnes and water turbine pressure adding another 40 tonnes.  The bearing has been in nearly continuous service since 1912, with no parts replaced.  The ASME reported it was still in service as of 2000.  As of 2002, the manufacturer estimated the bearings at Holtwood should have a maintenance-free life of about 1,300 years.

<doc id="3484419" title="Alternating factorial" nonfiltered="1205" processed="1190" dbindex="1481217">
In mathematics, an alternating factorial is the absolute value of the alternating sum of the first n factorials. 

This is the same as their sum, with the odd-indexed factorials multiplied by 1 if n is even, and the even-indexed factorials multiplied by  1 if n is odd, resulting in an alternation of signs of the summands (or alternation of addition and subtraction operators, if preferred). To put it algebraically,

;

or with the recurrence relation

;

in which af(1) = 1.

The first few alternating factorials are

1, 1, 5, 19, 101, 619, 4421, 35899, 326981, 3301819, 36614981, 442386619, 5784634181, 81393657019 ;

For example, the third alternating factorial is  1!   2! + 3!. The fourth alternating factorial is  1! + 2! - 3! + 4! = 19. Regardless of the parity of n, the last (nth) summand, n!, is given a positive sign, the (n - 1)th summand is given a negative sign, and the signs of the lower-indexed summands are alternated accordingly.

This pattern of alternation ensures the resulting sums are all positive integers. Changing the rule so that either the odd- or even-indexed summands are given negative signs (regardless of the parity of n) changes the signs of the resulting sums but not their absolute values.

Except for n = 1, the factorial of n and the alternating factorial of n are coprime.

Miodrag Zivkovi  proved in 1999 that there are only a finite number of alternating factorials that are also prime numbers, since 3612703 divides af(3612702) and therefore divides af(n) for all n   3612702. As of 2006, the known primes and probable primes are af(n) for 
n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 19, 41, 59, 61, 105, 160, 661, 2653, 3069, 3943, 4053, 4998, 8275, 9158, 11164 ;
Only the values up to n = 661 have been proved prime in 2006. af(661) is approximately 7.818097272875   101578.

Lawson N. Robertson (September 24, 1883 - January 22, 1951) was an American athlete.  He competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.

In the 100 meters, Robertson won his first round heat with a time of 11.4 seconds to advance to the semifinals.  There, he lost a close race to countryman Nathaniel Cartmell, both clocking at 11.2 seconds and Cartmell winning by about a foot.  The loss to Cartmell eliminated Robertson from advancing to the final.

On the same day as his semifinal loss in the 100 meters, Robertson was eliminated in the preliminary heats of the 200 meters with a second place finish in his heat.  His time was 23.0 seconds, 0.2 slower than the winner's.

Yoshi, known as Yosshi no Tamago (Yoshi's Egg) in Japan and Mario & Yoshi in Europe, is a video game released for the Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy.

The player controls Mario or Luigi and tries to keep blocks with monsters inside that are falling from the top of the screen from piling up so high that they reach the top. Mario and Luigi attempt to prevent this by switching the different columns of enemy characters back and forth so that they are positioned under different falling objects. If there is a chain of monsters within two yoshi egg shells, the egg shells will merge and a Yoshi will form, adding points and eliminating a group of monsters. The larger the chain of monsters between the two eggshells, the larger the Yoshi that is created will be. 

The game remains one of the more obscure titles of the Mario franchise, and has largely been overshadowed by more popular Mario/Yoshi themed puzzle games such as Yoshi's Cookie, Tetris Attack, and Dr. Mario.

Eddie Rockets is an Irish owned fast food franchise, with stores across Ireland, and in Gran Canaria and Liverpool.

The restaurants are themed as 1950s diners, and do not operate in the same manner as a typical fast-food chain; real crockery and cutlery are used, drinks are served in glassware, waiters are employed and food is brought to your seat.

Many of their restaurants are licensed to serve alcohol (Usually Route 66 Beer) and open late at night, meaning that their Dublin city centre locations have become part of the drinking culture in the city.

History.
The First one opened on South Annes Street in Dublin. Since then, they have opened in many other locations, such as Cork, Tallaght, Donnybrook, Rathmines, Baggot Street, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.

The American Curl is a breed of cat with unusual ears. The ears curl back from the face in a smooth arc toward the center of the back of the skull; they are otherwise perfectly normal cats. The breed is the result of a spontaneous mutation which occurred in a cat in Lakewood, California in 1981.  The first cat, a black female domestic cat, was found and taken in by the Ruga family who named her Shulamith.  All American Curls descend from her, the foundation female.  In 1983, the first American Curl was exhibited at a cat show, and in 1987, the longhair American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association (TICA).  In 1993, the American Curl set a precedent in the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) by being the first breed to be admitted to the Championship Class as one breed with two coat lengths.
The American Curl is a medium size cat (7-11 lbs) with no health handicaps associated with the curled ears.  They are strong, healthy cats remarkably free of genetic defects that affect many purebred cats, and will not reach maturity until 2-3 years of age.  The American Curl may have either curled ears or straight ears. If the cat's ears are curled, it will not be apparent until two or three days after the birth, and will take their final form after four months. The curled ears should be hard and stiff to the touch. The longhairs have a plush, silky coat, and the shorthairs have a thick, non-wooly coat, and is also silky. The American Curl may have three degrees of curl - first degree, second degree, or third degree. The third degree is the preferred one. Luxurious tufts of fur sprout from the bottom of the ears. The straight ear American Curl has all of the loving personality of the curled ear American Curl but may not be shown.  The American Curl comes in two coat lengths - either long haired or short haired. The American Curl comes in all colors.

The American Curl, while still an uncommon breed, is found across the world from the United States to Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and many other countries. 

The character "Ray" from the comic strip Achewood is an American Curl.

The character "Waffle" from catscratch is an American Curl.

Try 'N' B was a pop group formed by Frank Farian in Germany in 1992. It consisted of Gina Mohammed, Ray Horton, Tracy Ganser and Kevin Witherspoon. Their debut album, Sexy Eyes (self-titled for U.S.), was their only release.

The majority of songs from their album are covers from the second (The Real) Milli Vanilli album, The Moment of Truth (1990). While none of the members of Try 'N' B sang on Milli Vanilli's debut album, Gina Mohammed and Ray Horton were featured on the The Moment of Truth. Twin sisters Linda and Jodie Rocco sang the majority of the female backing vocals on the first and second Milli Vanilli releases, as well as on the Try 'N' B album.

Depending on the regional cover artwork, the artist was labelled as either Try 'N' B, Try NB or Try N B. The album art was changed shortly following release in Germany, with the group picture on the front swapped.

The songs "Keep On Running," "Body Slam," "The End Of Good Times" and "Nice 'N' Easy" were featured on the U.S. release, but were replaced with "Cherish Your Love," "Keep On Pushing Me," "Family Affair," "Tell Me Why" and "Good Time." on the worldwide release. The album was released by BMG internationally and through RCA in the U.S. In Germany, the group released three singles: "Sexy Eyes", "Tell Me Where It Hurts" and "Ding Dong".

<doc id="1825239" title="Queen's Commissioner" nonfiltered="1212" processed="1197" dbindex="1481224">
The King's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koning) is the head of a province in the Netherlands, who is chairman of both the Provinciale Staten (PS; the directly elected provincial parliament) and the Gedeputeerde Staten (GS; the executive branch), but only has a right to vote in  the latter. Since the reigning monarch is a queen, and has been since 1890, the current term is Queen's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koningin).

There are two levels of local government in the Netherlands, the provinces and the municipalities. The twelve provinces form the tier of administration between central government and the municipalities. The three tiers are organised in largely the same way, with a directly elected parliament, which in turn chooses the executive branch, headed by a non-democratically chosen chairman. On the national and municipal level these are the king and the mayor, on the provincial level it's the King's Commissioner.

Each province is governed by the Provinciale Staten ('PS'), who in turn choose the Gedeputeerde Staten (GS). The members of PS are elected directly every four years. Its main tasks are to decide policies and to oversee their implementation by the GS. Each member of the council has a vote and decisions are taken by majority vote of the members present. Council members usually have an ordinary job and undertake their council duties in their spare time. They receive an attendance allowance. Membership of GS is a full time job.

 Tasks of the Queen's Commissioner .

The Queen's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the ministers, presided by the king), for a term of six years, which may be extended by a second term. The Queen's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. When a vacancy arises, the provincial council gives the Minister of the Interior a profile of the kind of candidate it would like to see in the job. Although all Queen's Commissioners are prominent members of one or other of the major national political parties, their actions are expected to be politically impartial while they are in office. 

Queen's Commissioners play a role within the provincial administration and are the official representatives of central government in the provinces. They coordinate disaster management and prevention and pay regular official visits to the municipalities in their region.

Queen's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the Queen's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate. Since Queen's Commissioners are both the chairs and full members of the provincial executives, they may include some of the executive's tasks in their portfolio. They also oversee the official apparatus and any provincial utilities and represent the province in its dealings with business.

Santa's Grotto is the mythological workshop where Santa Claus makes the toys and presents given out at Christmas.

In the 20th century it became common during December in large shops or department stores to have a "cavern" in which an actor dressed up as Santa Claus to give gifts to children. Grottos can be large-walk through fantasy cavern-like areas incorporating animatronic characters such as elves and pantomime characters. This tradition probably started around the start of the 20th Century in London or New York in the largest department stores to attract customers.

In Adelaide, South Australia, the similar "Magic Cave" was set up in the John Martin's department store in Rundle Mall after the annual store-sponsored Adelaide Christmas Pageant.  Since the closure of John Martin's, David Jones department stores have continued the tradition of the Magic Cave, in Adelaide as well as in other Australian capitals.

For the comic, see Whoopee! (comic).;




Whoopee! was a Broadway musical comedy which debuted on 4 December, 1928.  The book is by William Anthony McGuire, featuring music by Walter Donaldson and lyrics by Gus Kahn.  The original version was produced by Florenz Ziegfeld and starred Eddie Cantor and Ruth Etting.  The two-act musical ran for 379 performances.


Whoopee was filmed lavishly in 1930 as a musical comedy film, closely following the version produced by Florenz Ziegfeld on the stage.  Directed by Thornton Freeland, it was photographed entirely in Technicolor.  It was produced by Florenz Ziegfeld and Samuel Goldwyn.  Whoopee made a movie star of Eddie Cantor, already one of the leading stars of Broadway Revues and Musical Comedies as well as being a popular recording artist of phonograph records in the United States.  George Olsen and his Music, already well-known Victor recording artists, repeated their work from the stage version. Other stars in the film are Eleanor Hunt, Ethel Shutta (George Olsen's wife), and Paul Gregory.  Future stars Betty Grable, Ann Sothern, and Virginia Bruce appear uncredited  as "Goldwyn Girls".  The film also launched the Hollywood career of Busby Berkeley and was Alfred Newman's first gig in Hollywood.  Richard Day did the set designs and behind the camera was Gregg Toland, who later found fame with Orson Welles.

The story line of Whoopee is somewhat aged by today's standards but there are several interesting moments in the movie, particularly Cantor's rendition of the song "Makin' Whoopee" (later a hit for Ray Charles), and some of the big production numbers with the Goldwyn Girls.

Whoopee is an important but overlooked film in the history of the Hollywood musical.  Made a year before the movie industry began to fully feel the effects of the Great Depression, it had a ticket price of $5 when it opened and made Samuel Goldwyn a lot of money. In the history of musicals, it shows a look years ahead of its time and foreshadows all of the great Warner Brothers musicals of the 1930s.

A 1979 Broadway revival garnered star Charles Repole a Drama Desk Award nomination.

The Trials of Life: A Natural History of Behaviour is a BBC nature documentary series written and presented by David Attenborough, first transmitted in the UK from 4 October 1990.

A study in animal behaviour, it was the third in a trilogy of major series (beginning with Life on Earth) that took a broad overview of nature, rather than the more specialised surveys of Attenborough's later productions. Each of the twelve 50-minute episodes features a different aspect of the journey through life, from birth to adulthood and continuation of the species through reproduction.

The series was produced in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Service and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. The executive producer was Peter Jones and the music was composed by George Fenton.

Part of David Attenborough's 'Life' series, it was preceded by The Living Planet (1984) and followed by Life in the Freezer (1993).

Background.
The series took over three-and-a-half years to film, during which time Attenborough travelled almost a quarter of a million miles. The production team sought to further push the boundaries of natural history filmmaking, following on from the advances made in The Living Planet, and were provided with several new challenges.

The sequence of chimpanzees hunting colobus monkeys was only possible through the efforts of Hedwige and Christophe Boesch, who had spent five years studying the apes in the Ivory Coast forests of West Africa.

Meanwhile, a bivouac of army ants in Panama was able to be filmed internally with the aid of a medical endoscope. Furthermore, a new type of camera lens enabled tree ants to be filmed in enlarged close-up just in front of Attenborough   with both subjects in sharp focus. This gave the illusion that the insects were much larger than their actual size.

Filming critical moments in the life of a herd of elephants necessitated the expertise of Cynthia Moss, who had devoted 25 years to researching the animals in Kenya. She was able to advise the production team on the right moments to film specific events.

The camera team had only one chance to film a 60,000-strong flock of waders flying over David Attenborough's head in Norfolk, and the RSPB was enlisted to predict their flightpath. By contrast, the Florida scrub jays couldn't have been more co-operative: since the particular group being filmed had been studied closely and were used to humans, a bird could land on Attenborough's hand right on cue.

The inside of a termite mound proved especially challenging for Attenborough: it was so cramped that he could only face in one direction. He therefore had to slowly crawl backwards out of shot when performing re-takes.

Behaviour seen for the first time included the sequence that was eventually selected to illustrate the series' DVD cover: that of a killer whale pouncing on a colony of sea lions on a Patagonian beach and 'playing' with its young prey before consuming it. This meant some risks being taken by the cameramen, as they placed themselves in the water just feet away from the creatures in order to obtain close-ups of an attack run.

Episodes.
"The savage, rocky shores of Christmas Island, 200 miles south of Java, in the Indian Ocean. It s November, the moon is in its third quarter, and the sun is just setting. And in a few hours from now, on this very shore, a thousand million lives will be launched."

1. "Arriving".
Broadcast 4 October 1990, the first episode examines the various methods by which creatures come into the world. Attenborough s opening statement alludes to the annual spawning of the Christmas Island red crab, of which there are estimated to be some 120 million. The exercise is all the more hazardous since the species is a land crab, and the eggs have to be deposited in the sea   where the most ancient animals on the planet still live and breed. One of the most prolific aquatic egg producers is the giant clam, but some land animals also lay vast quantities, and the mantis is one example. In the Western United States, Attenborough observes a wasp that digs a burrow, conceals it, and stocks it with fresh caterpillars for her emerging young. The grubs of another start life inside caterpillars, and eat the unsuspecting hosts. The problems of larger animals are illustrated by snow geese in the Arctic, which have to defend their eggs from arctic foxes. The process of embryonic growth inside the egg, from laying to hatching, is shown in detail. The malleefowl warms its eggs with rotting leaves, and Attenborough demonstrates the care with which it regulates them by adding sand to its mound   to have it kicked back in his face. The sea louse is a crustacean that commits suicide: its grubs consume so much of the mother s energies that she dies after birth. Mammals shown giving birth to fully formed young include wildebeest, antelope, sea lions and chinchillas.

2. "Growing Up".
Broadcast 11 October 1990, this programme describes the ways that various species care for their young. Attenborough defines childhood as achieving two tasks: growing and surviving. He highlights the elephant seal as an animal that experiences a compressed childhood, being abandoned after three weeks and left for up to another eight alone, while it becomes large enough to be able to swim. For terns, there is safety in numbers as the dense population works together to drive out marauding gulls. The snow geese in the Russian arctic show intense devotion as they escort their goslings by foot to the coast some 50 kilometres away. Scorpions carry their young on their backs, while a shrew will leave hers under a stone while she goes to feed. The eider duck is one creature that shares responsibility for its offspring: females regularly supervise the ducklings of others in a group. The mara is another that uses a crèche system, as does the bat, whose nurseries can be up to a million strong. The Florida scrub jay has developed complex parental relationships, using teams rather than pairs. Such behaviour is exhibited on a larger scale by elephants, where all females take an interest in raising a single calf. A chimpanzee s childhood is socially complicated, as an individual must learn how to behave towards others, as well as master the use of tools. Albatrosses must be accomplished fliers as soon as possible   chicks are shown being hunted by tiger sharks.

3. "Finding Food".
Broadcast 18 October 1990, the next instalment is devoted to the ways in which animals gather their sustenance. Attenborough begins in the South American rainforest, where the proliferation of animal and plant life does not necessarily make it easy to find food. Some leaves are poisonous, and so those that eat them have to be careful. Other plants use food (or nectar) as a bribe to get their pollen transported, and several species of hummingbird have developed exclusive relationships with certain of them.  Fruit is also on offer, again as a means of reproduction, and creatures such as squirrel monkeys eat little else. Meanwhile, parrots and macaws take kaolin as an antidote to their diet of toxic seeds. Attenborough witnesses a 60,000 strong flock of knot and dunlin suddenly take advantage of a low tide to feed on tiny mud-dwelling molluscs. Barracuda hunt small fish, and drive shoals of them into bays to be eaten by pelicans, which are besieged by gulls that attempt to steal their catches. One species of gecko is able to differentiate between worker termites and the more dangerous soldiers. The web of the orb spider is hailed as one of the most elegant food catching devices, and the methods of two others, nephila and its kleptoparasite visitor, argyrodes, are explored in detail. Finally, tropicbirds, their crops full with food en route back to their nests, are ambushed in mid-air by a group of frigatebirds, whose aim is to make them surrender their cargo.

4. "Hunting and Escaping".
Broadcast 25 October 1990, this episode looks at those that hunt other creatures and ways of avoiding capture. Attenborough is attacked by a pair of skuas as he approaches their nest, which demonstrates this particular bird's aggressive behaviour, both when taking food and defending its young. Off the shores of Patagonia, the same group of killer whales returns each year to ambush sea lion pups, which stray out of the safer shallow waters. Having grabbed their prey, they take it back out to sea and 'play' with it for some time before killing it. Poison can be used both as a weapon and a deterrent, such as by the viper and tomato frog respectively. Some animals advertise their defensive measures in advance, in case deployment occurs too late. Among them are the skunk, which discharges an appalling smell, and some salamanders that display their toxicity by remaining stationary, with their warning markings visible. Several species of stick insect and their elaborate camouflage are shown. However, none of these methods of protection pose problems to army ants, which can subdue any of their prey, simply by virtue of their size and vast numbers. The Harris hawk is unusual, since it hunts in teams, and a group of six are shown practising their skill in the desert of New Mexico. The final sequence depicts a troop of chimpanzees displaying strategy and co-ordination as it successfully pursues colobus monkeys through a forest in the Ivory Coast.

5. "Finding the Way".
Broadcast 1 November 1990, this programme explores forms of navigation. Attenborough starts in Africa at dusk, by describing some of the species that don't rely on sight. The spotted hyena uses its acute sense of smell to guide it while it hunts nocturnally, while galagos urinate on their hands so they can completely mark their movements. Some animals use echolocation and these include swiftlets, bats and river dolphins. By contrast, electric eels use fields of electricity to sense their environment. During the hours of daylight, other methods are employed: the rufous elephant shrew, with its carefully cleared network of pathways, has a sharp mental picture of its habitat   even knowing the various shortcuts with which to evade capture. Attenborough visits the Sahara to illustrate a species that makes the longest overland journey of any insect: cataglyphis, an ant that uses the sun's position to enable it to return to its nest in a straight line. Lobsters in the Bahamas are shown marching in columns to escape stormy waters. In its search for perpetual daylight in which to fish, the Arctic tern makes a 19,000-kilometre journey from one end of the Earth to the other. The albatross is highlighted as one of the most skilled navigators: it can travel up to 1300 kilometres over sea in search of food for its chicks, and still find its way back to the nest. Finally, Attenborough stands on a waterfall in Ireland to tell of the three-year, 10,000-kilometre journey made by elvers.

6. "Home Making".
Broadcast 8 November 1990, this instalment deals with how animals construct their shelters from the elements and predators. Burrows and holes can provide considerable refuge, and Attenborough inspects the home of the American prairie dog, an elaborate construction that has its own air conditioning system. Silk is such a valuable commodity that those that can't make it steal it instead. The hermit hummingbird uses it to attach its nest to the underside of a leaf, while the Indian tailorbird stitches two leaves together. However, the expert in complex nest-building is the weaverbird which makes its abode from over 1,000 strips of grass that are perfectly interwoven   and dismantling it if it fails to attract a mate. The beaver is responsible for one of the biggest animal dwellings: its wooden lodge that rises from the river bed stays in place from one generation to the next, and so requires constant maintenance. Some stingless bees use their wax and the resin of tree bark to create labyrinthine structures containing various compartments. Mud is also used by several creatures, such as the potter wasp and the cliff swallow. The termites' intricate creations allow for security, heating, air conditioning, self-contained nurseries and gardens, and sanitation systems. Attenborough hails the species as the consummate home maker, and explores a 15-foot colony in West Africa that contains 1.5 million insects: he crawls right inside to examine its method of ventilation.

7. "Living Together".
Broadcast 15 November 1990, this episode focuses on those species that co-operate and depend on (or exploit) others. Spotted deer follow langur monkeys as they travel from tree to tree, eating any leaves that get dropped from above. In return, the deer serve as a lookout when the primates are feeding on the ground. Underwater, a hermit crab is shown adding sea anemones to its shell in order to protect itself from attack by an octopus, and a goby assists a virtually blind shrimp. Fleas, lice and mites are parasites: they share no mutual partnership and instead take advantage of creatures for food or shelter. However, parasites have their predators, and an example are the finches of the Galápagos Islands that clear the resident giant tortoises of their ticks, and oxpeckers, which do the same for giraffes in Africa (and even use its fur to line their nests). Some fish regularly clean others, and wrasse and shrimp appear to specialise in this regard, as do remora, which permanently hang on to their hosts. One parasite that grows inside its host is the fluke, and one is shown gestating inside a snail, having previously been unknowingly eaten. Because it needs to transfer to a bird's gut to develop further, it causes the snail to advertise its presence to allow itself to be consumed   thus completing the circle. However, some microscopic creatures inhabit the stomachs of large herbivores in order to break down the cellulose of their diet, thereby aiding their digestion.

8. "Fighting".
Broadcast 22 November 1990, this programme details how fighting   both physical and psychological   is used for food, land or to gain a mate. Territorial conflict is demonstrated by the hummingbird, and Attenborough illustrates its aggressiveness by placing a stuffed specimen nearby, only to have it speared by its opponent's bill. The midas cichlid on the other hand, has no weapons to speak of, and so uses its mouth to hold on for trials of strength. By contrast, the forelegs of a mantis shrimp are powerful enough to crack the shell of another crustacean: therefore disputes or courtship are fraught with danger. Animals that possess lethal food-gathering weapons usually don't use them against one another, as neither side wishes to risk death. For example, one venomous snake will aim to floor the other, rather than bite. Wolves and big cats largely use snarls and body posture to convey their threat. There are no holds barred between rival zebras: kicking and biting is employed until a victor emerges, whereas giraffes slam their necks against each other. Normally peacable mountain gorillas are shown squabbling when play gets out of hand, and one of them communicates real fright by urinating uncontrollably. Large herbivores that have horns or antlers are naturally inclined to use them to assert their dominance over the females in a herd. Duelling male ibex and Alaskan bull moose undergo some of the most ferocious engagements   sometimes to the death. 

9. "Friends and Rivals".
Broadcast 29 November 1990, this instalment investigates the ways in which those animals that live in social groups interact with each other. The solitary eagle is contrasted with whooper swans landing in Scotland after a 1,600-kilometre journey from Iceland. Once arrived, they must battle for territory with those already there, and pairs or families are usually victorious. Attenborough uses a group of farmyard chickens to demonstrate a pecking order. A pride of lions is shown co-operating to subdue a buffalo. Afterwards, each animal peacefully awaits its turn at the carcass. Baboons live in troops of up to 150, and their complex dominance hierarchy is examined in detail. Vampire bats display mutual assistance by regurgitating blood for any neighbour that has missed out on a night's feeding. Dwarf mongooses live in family groups of around a dozen. While some look for food or sleep, others are always posted on the lookout for predators and quickly raise the alarm if necessary. Meanwhile, some of the most extreme co-operation is demonstrated by the underground naked mole rat, whose 80-strong clusters are divided into workers (who tunnel perpetually), soldiers (who only act when danger threatens), and a single queen for breeding. Leafcutter ants are shown transporting their food deep below ground: it has to be planted in a special fungus to remove its indigestible cellulose, and each stage of the operation is carried out by a different caste of individuals.

10. "Talking to Strangers".
Broadcast 6 December 1990, this episode concentrates on communication. In Kenya, Attenborough accompanies a tribesman who calls to a honeyguide, which in turn answers him and leads the pair to a bees' nest. The tribesman extracts the honey, and some is left to reward the bird. African hunting dogs are shown hunting gazelles, of which the target is the individual that leaps lowest. Larks evade merlin by sending a similar message: by continuing to sing while being chased, it tells the pursuer that its prey is fit and therefore will be difficult to catch. (In 80% of cases this turns out to be true.) Vervet monkeys' cries are among the most complex. Their utterances are effectively words: a vocabulary that defines each of their predators, so an alarm call is specific to a particular threat. Some creatures transmit their presence by display, and Attenborough observes thousands of fireflies illuminating the darkness. Sounds travel further underwater, and over 200 species of fish use them to communicate. In turn, sea lions have become adept at sensing their proximity. However, the most visual aquatic animal is the squid, which uses colour change and posture to communicate. Finally, Attenborough swims with dolphins. They converse with a series of ultrasonic clicks, and each has a family call inherited from its mother: effectively a 'surname'. They also use normal sound, body posture and touch   in short, in terms of ability to communicate, they are man's closest rival.

11. "Courting".
Broadcast 13 December 1990, this programme surveys the methods employed in attracting a mate, mainly those of birds. The Indian florican inhabits long grass, and so is difficult to see. In order to gain attention, it 'trampolines' in the same spot for up to 400 times a day. Whales sing to their prospective partners, and the female's calls can be heard by suitors for over eight kilometres. When animals send out signals of attraction, they must also ensure that they don't entice the wrong species, and so have markings that differ prominently. Attenborough highlights the booby as an example: there are around half a dozen species, all of which may occupy the same island. However, the blue-footed booby reassures its chosen mate by continually lifting its feet. Tropicbirds and marsh harriers are shown providing graceful aerobatic displays, while the sac-winged bat uses a strong perfume to lure a companion. Among those birds that produce the most spectacular visual displays are the lyrebird (which also has an elaborate song), the peacock, and the riflebird (and indeed most other birds of paradise). The bowerbird invites potential partners to inspect its bower: a specially prepared area that contains a hut or walkway augmented by strikingly coloured objects. The intricate dances performed by manakins in Trinidad are also examined. Finally, Attenborough observes the topi's display courts, whose sharply defined boundaries are jealously guarded by rival males.

12. "Continuing the Line".
Broadcast 20 December 1990, the final instalment illustrates how species fulfil their ultimate raison d'être and ensure that their genes are passed on to the next generation. It is a universal problem, but one which has given rise to a variety of solutions. Barnacles cannot move, but each has both male and female sex cells, allowing each neighbour to be a potential mate. On the other end of the scale, a female elephant undergoes a long pregnancy   22 months   and so wishes to ensure that her calf is fathered by a strong and proven male. She is therefore very choosy about her partner. A female chinchilla is even more so, and rejects an unwanted suitor by squirting urine in its face. Mating is a dangerous business when weapons are involved, and a male tarantula approaches his intended with trepidation. Only when he succeeds in holding off her poison fangs is he able to progress any further. For some, the right moments to get together are few and far between: a male crab, for example, must wait until a female moults her shell before he is able to fertilise her. Male sea lions are shown fighting over a harem, and some use the battle to their advantage by making off with reluctant females. Attenborough observes that the monogamous relationships enjoyed by humans are rare within the animal kingdom, but he highlights the Royal albatross as a "beautiful" exception. The pair of birds featured met as five-year-olds, and have been together for twenty years.

"If you watch animals objectively for any length of time, you're driven to the conclusion that their main aim in life is to pass on their genes to the next generation. Most do so directly, by breeding. In the few examples that don't do so by design, they do it indirectly, by helping a relative with whom they share a great number of their genes. And in as much as the legacy that human beings pass on to the next generation is not only genetic but to a unique degree cultural, we do the same. So animals and ourselves, to continue the line, will endure all kinds of hardship, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and eventually the next generation appears."

DVD and book.
The series is available in the UK for Regions 2 and 4 as a 4-disc DVD set (BBCDVD1428, released 27 September 2004) and as part of The Life Collection. Erroneously entitled Trials of Life, its sole extra feature is a 50-minute documentary: The Making of The Trials of Life. It was previously released in 2002 as a 3-disc set, with each episode cut to 35 minutes.

The accompanying book, The Trials of Life: A Natural History of Behaviour by David Attenborough (ISBN 0-00-219912-2), was published by BBC Books on 4 October 1990. It is currently out of print.

The first computer-aided maintenance software came from DEC in the 1980s to configure VAX computers. The software was built using the techniques of artificial intelligence expert systems, because the problem of configuring a VAX required expert knowledge. During the research, the software was called R1. As one of the first expert systems to be pressed into commercial service, renamed XCON, it created high expectations, which did not materialize, as DEC lost commercial pre-eminence.

But, fundamentally, XCON was a rule-based configuration database. The expert system used forward chaining rules.

 Help Desk software .
Help Desk software frequently captures symptoms of a bug and relates them to fixes, in a fix database. One of the problems with this approach, is that the understanding of the problem is embodied in a non-human way, so that solutions are not unified.

 Strategies for finding fixes .
The bubble-up strategy simply records pairs of symptoms and fixes. The most frequent set of pairs is then presented as a tentative solution, which is then attempted. If the fix works, that fact is further recorded, along with the configuration of the presenting system, into a solutions database.
Oddly enough, shutting down and booting up again manages to 'fix' (or at least 'mask' a bug) in many computer-based systems; thus reboot is the remedy for distressingly many symptoms in a 'fix database'.
Currently, most expertise in finding fixes lies in human domain experts, who simply sit at a replica of the computer-based system, and who then 'talk through' the problem with the client to duplicate the problem, and then relate the fix.

Zakk Wylde (born Jeffery Phillip Wiedlandt on January 14, 1967 in Bayonne, New Jersey) is the lead guitarist, singer and songwriter of Black Label Society and guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne.  Wylde has also fronted the Southern Rock band Pride & Glory as well as releasing the more acoustic oriented album "Book of Shadows" under his own stage name.

Career.

Wylde started playing the guitar at the age of 15 and used to work at Silverton Music in Silverton, New Jersey. He grew up in Jackson and went to Jackson Memorial Highschool where he graduated from in 1985. He practiced guitar as much as 12 hours per day. Often, he would play the guitar almost non-stop between coming home from school and leaving for school the next morning. He would then sleep through the school day.

Growing up, Wylde played locally with his first band called "Stone Henge" then later with local Jersey band "Zyris". Years later, a virtually unknown 20 year-old Wylde landed the coveted role as lead guitarist and co-writer for Ozzy Osbourne. He sent Ozzy a demo tape in 1987 and was hired to replace the departed Jake E. Lee. Jake had replaced the deceased Randy Rhoads, an idol of Wylde's, for whom he even built a shrine.

It is said that Wylde, at the age of 20 (incorrectly stated as being 19), was hired after only one audition. Wylde's then-girlfriend (now wife) Barbaranne heard Ozzy was looking for a new guitarist on the Howard Stern radio show. While playing at a local gig, a photographer spoke to Wylde urging him to audition for Ozzy, and offered to send a presskit along to Osbourne; Wylde, who at the time was working at a local Getty gas station, decided he had nothing to lose. Ozzy dismissed the tape among thousands of others as "just another Randy Rhoads clone". But a couple weeks later, Randy Castillo, Ozzy's drummer at the time told him he'd found this great guitarist from New Jersey. Wylde recalled how he received a phone call from Sharon Osbourne (thinking it was one of his friends' mother) telling him there was a ticket for him to fly out and audition for Ozzy. Ozzy soon recognized him from the tape and press kit, and hired him as his new guitarist.

Ozzy had run through many hopefuls following Lee's departure. At his fated audition, Wylde reminisces that he was hired on the spot even before he started playing, when he was still tuning his guitar. He first appeared in No Rest for the Wicked in 1988 with Ozzy Osbourne. In addition to Black Label Society, Wylde has been part of a Southern style blues band called "Pride & Glory" that released one self-titled album before disbanding. He has also released an acoustic solo project entitled "Book of Shadows" that contained a much different style of music than he had been accustomed to producing in the past, again forming Wylde's signature technique with even more diversity, going from a local nobody to holder of a coveted role in merely a matter of months. 

Zakk Wylde's guitar-playing style is usually characterized by his use of pinch harmonics and wide vibrato. His guitar soloing technique is usually characterized by his use of the minor pentatonic scale, playing rapid box-pattern licks using strict alternate-picking, creating a very distinctive, choppy attack, compared to the more fluid playing styles of other rock guitarists. Another notable feature of Wylde's playing is his liberal use of "chicken pickin' ," a technique which is usually associated with country music, and which is (comparatively) rarely seen in heavy metal; a technique he has picked up from watching Albert Lee, one of his influences.

He is known for his use of Gibson Les Paul Custom model guitars with a unique "bulls-eye" graphic on them, a design he used to deliberately differentiate himself visually from Randy Rhoads - who was also frequently identified by his white Les Paul Custom. Interestingly, one of Wylde's favorite stage guitars of late is a replica of Rhoads' Flying V. The "bulls-eye" paint job was originally supposed to look like the spiral from the movie Vertigo, but when it came back incorrect from the luthier, he liked the result and stuck with it. 

Wylde's signature Les Pauls include, a red and flame-maple bulls-eye model, a black and antique-white bulls-eye model, an orange "buzz-saw" model, which Zakk got the pattern off a zippo lighter, and a "camo" bulls-eye model with mother of pearl neck inlays and a green camouflage paint scheme. His original bulls-eye Les Paul was bought from a regular store front and is christened "The Grail". It was lost to Wylde for some time when it fell off the truck as he was coming back from a gig in Texas. Rewards were posted to anyone that had information about the guitar - it holds sentimental value to him since it was a gift from his parents. 

Wylde and The Grail were only reunited years later, after a fan bought it at a pawn shop and realized he may very well have the missing guitar after checking the initials "Z.W." on its back and the serial number marked on the headstock. He then contacted Wylde's webmaster to arrange its return. 

Ozzy has always left the option open to his band members to leave if they wish, but Wylde has stayed faithfully by Ozzy's side ever since he was a teenager. Wylde has also in the past auditioned and was poised to become part of Guns N' Roses but a miscommunication between management led to Wylde never having the opportunity to play with Axl Rose.

Wylde has stated that he has no respect for musicians who release material "not true to themselves". As a consequence, the band Limp Bizkit and their frontman, Fred Durst are regularly ridiculed during Black Label Society's live events. 

On January 17, 2006, Zakk Wylde was immortalized at the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame located at 7425 Sunset Blvd, featuring his hand prints and signature, in recognition to his successful career as a musician and contribution to music industry. The event was open to the public and had the presence of many rock celebrities.

Although Ozzy Osbourne has been auditioning new guitarists for future material, he announced Wylde as the official guitarist for his new album as a follow-up to his last studio release, "Down To Earth". Notably, the band performed recently during the latest UK Music Hall of Fame, playing "Crazy Train".

Black Label Society's new album, "Shot To Hell", was released on September 11th (UK), 12th (US) through Roadrunner records with production by Michael Beinhorn (Soundgarden, Ozzy Osbourne, Red Hot Chili Peppers). Black Label Society headlined the 2nd stage this years Ozzfest, with Wylde playing double duty with Ozzy on certain dates. Ozzy's new album will be out in 2007. Zakk is currently working a new film called The Berserkers, with script and production done by Zakk himself. Rumours suggest that the agents of several popular actors have been approaching Zakk for roles.

Personal life.
Wylde and his wife, Barbaranne, have 3 children; a 14-year-old daughter, Hayley-Rae, a 13-year-old son, Jesse John Michael (named after Ozzy Osbourne), and a 4-year-old son, Hendrix (named after Jimi Hendrix). He and his family live outside of Los Angeles. He and Barbaranne both attended Jackson Memorial High School in Jackson, New Jersey.  Zakk was a close friend of the deceased Dimebag Darrell since 1993, exchanging guitars in admiration for one another as fellow guitarists. Wylde had given Dimebag one of his custom Gibson guitars with the trademark "bulls-eye" design on it shortly before the guitarist's untimely death. Wylde dedicated the song "In This River" to Dimebag, citing that although the song wasn't originally written for him, the lyrics were fitting to the situation. He dedicates each live performance of the song to Dimebag.

Appearances.
Wylde has done guest appearances on many albums, such as the debut album for Damageplan as guest vocalist and guitar on the tracks "Soul Bleed" and "Reborn." He has also worked on four of Derek Sherinian's solo albums: "Inertia", "Black Utopia", "Mythology" and "Blood of the Snake" alongside Yngwie Malmsteen among others.

Wylde's film credits include Rock Star (As "Ghode", guitarist of the fictitious band Steel Dragon) and the concert DVD Boozed, Broozed, and Broken-Boned (Certified Platinum), recorded at Harpo's in Detroit, MI. It was the first time in the concert hall's history that all of the alcohol had been consumed on one night (Wylde's favorite beer is Sierra Nevada Pale Ale). He has also done a comedy skit show alongside Jim Breuer, titled "Crapshoot", which is now available on DVD.

Zakk Wylde also appeared on the TV show Angel in the season 4 episode The Magic Bullet where he plays acoustic on the song "Mandy" while Angel and Conner sing along.

Wylde has also appeared as a guest star on the TV show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. In it, he plays guitar on a track produced by Master Shake that is supposed to become the next big birthday song, which is called "Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary." Wylde becomes irate when he finds out that Master Shake cannot pay him for his input on the project. Later in the show, Wylde is killed when caught between the crossfire of two metal scorpions armed with laser cannons. 

He is a New York Yankees and New York Giants fan. He also performed the National Anthem on the electric guitar during a New York Rangers game in October 2005.

Zakk has also performed the National Anthem at a Los Angeles Kings hockey game, a video of which is included as an extra feature, on the DVD Boozed, Broozed, and Broken-Boned

On February 2, 2007 Zakk Wylde guest hosted on Seattle's 99.9 KISW on the afternoon program The Mens Room

Gear.


Zakk Wylde uses Gibson Les Paul Custom guitars with a "bulls-eye" graphic, as well as the famous "Rebel" Les Paul decorated with bottle caps, in addition to other guitars such as a Jackson Randy Rhoads, a Dean Bulls-eye Razorback, and a Gibson EDS-1275). His guitars are outfitted with his signature GHS Zakk Wylde Boomers strings and a set of active EMG 81 and EMG 85 humbucker pick-ups (with the exception of his Razorback until the release of the album Shot To Hell.) He usually gives preference to Marshall amplifiers such as the JCM800 2203's and 2204's (He has his own Signature JCM800ZW Amp with replaced tubes and cabinet loaded with EVM12L-Black Label guitar speakers). Jim Dunlop worked with Zakk to design two effect pedals, the MXR ZW-44 Dunlop Overdrive pedal, and the ZW-45 Zakk Wylde Signature "Cry Baby" wah-wah pedal.The MXR m-134 stereo chorus,and the MXR EVH Van Halen signature phase pedal are also in his pedal board. In the past, his pedal board consisted in one BOSS SD-1 Super Overdrive, a CE-5 Chorus Ensemble, a Jim Dunlop Wah-Wah and a Rotovibe. 

Zakk's settings for Standard, Eb, Dropped D, and Dropped B tuning: GBZW (.010 .013 .017 .036 .052 .060) and for Dropped A, Dropped G, and other dropped tunings in a "D" tuning: GBWZLO (.011 .014 .018 .036 .052 .070).(mostly used in the studio)

357 Customs controversy and lawsuit.  	 
- 	In December of 2005, a promotional offer was posted on ZakkWylde.com, stating that anyone who bought a $100 merchandise gift certificate and a miniature model of a chopper would receive an $800 Epiphone guitar. The offer was posted by custom chopper company 357 Customs, through webmaster Chad Dyer. 	
	
- 	On June 2, 2006, Bob Ringe, Zakk Wylde's manager, stated on the website that "357 Customs ran a promotion directed toward Zakk's fans, and  357 has not delivered merchandise ordered during the promotion. Zakk has not authorized or otherwise been involved with this promotion, and has not received any compensation from it." Ringe went on further to state that he has instructed his lawyers to "contact 357....monitor this situation and follow up with 357." 	 
- 		 
- 	One week later, on June 9, 2006, Zakk Wylde corroborated Ringe's statement and the involvement of his lawyers in "address the situation." On June 14th, 2006, Zakk Wylde's attorneys filed suit against 357 Customs Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of California. The suit alleges trademark infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of contract, as well as several other counts. The text of the lawsuit indicates that it was brought about to prevent any preying upon of Zakk's loyal fans in the future and to recoup unpaid royalties as 357 Customs failed to deliver on its agreements with Zakk Wylde. There is nothing in the suit thus far to indicate any kind of specific damages to be recovered on behalf of fans who have not received their merchandise other than as-yet unspecified damages pertaining to this suit. Text of Lawsuit 	 
- 		 
- 	On July 5, 2006, webmaster Chad Dyer was asked to resign from the website. He admitted being hired (but not paid) by 357 Customs to maintain ZakkWylde.com and claimed that he wasn't aware of the conflict of interest.

The New River is a 2.2 mile long (3.6 km) stream in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States.  It is a tributary of the Ellis River, part of the Saco River watershed flowing to the Atlantic Ocean in Maine.

The New River rises in the Gulf of Slides, a small glacial cirque at the foot of Boott Spur, a southern extension of Mount Washington.  Flowing northeast, the stream drops rapidly down the western slopes of Pinkham Notch, joining the Ellis River in the floor of the notch at the Route 16 crossing, just south of the notch's height of land.

The Social Democratic People's Party (Turkish: Sosyaldemokrat Halk Partisi) or SHP is a Turkish left Social Democratic Party established by Murat Karayalç n, former Ankara Metropolitan Mayor (1989-1993) and Foreign Minister (1994-1995).

Following Karayalç n's resignation from the Republican People's Party (Turkey), a number of social democrats and moderate & liberal socialists came together to establish SHP. Although the newly-established SHP had most of its policies in common with a former party with the same abbreviation SHP, they never had an organic tie.

In 2004 Turkish local elections SHP came forward in an alliance with the pro-Kurdish Democratic People's Party and the radical left Freedom and Solidarity Party. The party leader Murat Karayalç n also became a candidate for his former seat of Ankara Metropolitan Municipality in these elections, However, he lost to the incumbent mayor Melih Gökçek of AK Parti.

SHP has currently (August 2006) two members in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, two former deputies having resigned in early August from the party in, what they claimed, was a show of reaction to the lack of concern by the party management against separatist terrorism. 

The party is currently still led by Murat Karayalç n.

Darius Perkins is an Australian actor. His first role was on The Sullivans in 1976. He played "Charlie" in All The Green Years and played guest roles in Prisoner and A Country Practice. This was followed by his most notable and longest-running role, that of Scott Robinson in soap opera Neighbours, in 1985. 

He was the original actor to play the role, but appeared for only the show's first year. When the series moved to Network Ten at the start of 1986 Perkins was fired due to problems with his behaviour on the set including lateness, and Jason Donovan took over the role. The character remained in the show until 1989 and would marry Charlene Mitchell (played by Perkins former Sullivans co-star, Kylie Minogue).

After leaving Neighbours in 1986 Perkins played Gary Samuels in Home And Away, a new soap opera devised as a rival for Neighbours. He subsequently appeared once again on A Country Practice in the mid-1990s, and more recently has been seen working behind the scenes, most notably in the art department for the TV series Crashburn.

Larenz Tate (born September 8, 1975 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American actor. Born on the west side of Chicago, Tate is the youngest of three siblings (his two brothers, Larron and Lahmard, are also actors) whose family moved to California when he was nine years old. Convinced by their parents (whose father is teacher Larry Tate at Suva Intermediate School at the City of Bell Gardens, California) to enter a drama program at the Inner City Cultural Center, the trio didn't take the lessons seriously until classmate Malcolm-Jamal Warner's ascent to fame after being cast on the hugely popular sitcom The Cosby Show. Subsequently realizing that they could parlay their efforts into a tangible form of success, the siblings began to receive small roles and in 1985, Tate made his small-screen debut in an episode of The Twilight Zone -- The Series. Following appearances in such popular television series as 21 Jump Street and The Wonder Years, Tate was cast in the made-for-television feature The Women of Brewster Place before receiving a recurring role in the popular family comedy series Family Matters (1989). He was also a cast member on the short-lived CBS series The Royal Family, starring Redd Foxx and Della Reese. In the video game 187 Ride or Die, Tate voices the main character, Buck.

Film career.

Following numerous small-screen roles, offers began pouring in for Tate, and in late 1992, collaborative filmmaking siblings Albert and Allen Hughes approached him to star in their debut feature Menace II Society. A jarring vision of inner-city desperation and decay, the film found Tate channeling his substantial energy into creating  "O-Dog", a trigger-happy teenager. Following up with the little-seen but often-praised television series South Central, Tate would later appear in the family comedy-drama The Inkwell (1994) before re-teaming with the Hughes brothers for Dead Presidents (1995) and taking on the role of a love-stricken young poet in the romantic drama Love Jones (1997). With subsequent roles in such films as The Postman (as the automotively monikered Ford Lincoln Mercury), the Frankie Lymon biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love (1998, with Tate as Lymon), and 2000's Love Come Down, Tate continued to compel audiences well into the new millennium. Though a big theatrical release had eluded Tate for the first few years of the millennial turnover, Tate would soon turn up opposite Lawrence Fishburne in the high-octane Biker Boyz (2003), A Man Apart (2003), Crash (2004), and as music legend Quincy Jones in Ray (2004). Larenz was also featured in R&B singer Ashanti's 2003 released music video Rain on Me, where he played the jealous, abusive spouse of Ashanti. The video touched on the subject of domestic abuse.

<doc id="5904729" title="Patristic anthology" nonfiltered="1225" processed="1210" dbindex="1481237">
A patristic anthology, commonly called a florilegium, is a systematic collections of excerpts (more or less copious) from the works of the Church Fathers and other ecclesiastical writers of the early period, compiled with a view to serve dogmatic or ethical purposes. These encyclopedic compilations are a characteristic product of the later Byzantine theological school, and form a very considerable branch of the extensive literature of the Greek Catenæ.

Two classes of Christian florilegia may here be distinguished: the dogmatic and the ascetical, or ethical. The dogmatic florilegia are collections of Patristic citations designed to exhibit the continuous and connected teaching of the Fathers on some specific doctrine. The first impulse to compilations of this nature was given by the Christological controversies that convulsed the Eastern Church during the fifth century, when, both at the gatherings of the great church councils and in private circles, the practical need had made itself definitely felt, of having at hand, for ready reference, a convenient summary of what the Fathers and most approved theologians had held and taught concerning certain controversial doctrines. Such a summary, setting forth the views of Nestorius and the mind of the orthodox Fathers, was first laid before the Council of Ephesus, in 431, by St. Cyril of Alexandria. Summaries of dogmatic utterances were used also at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and at the Fifth General Council in 533.
 
Only in the seventh century the dogmatic florilegia assumed a fully developed and definite form. At the Sixth General Council, in 680, two of these collections played a very prominent rôle, one, constructed by Macarius, the Patriarch of Antioch, in favour of the Monothelites, and the other, a counter collection presented by the legates of Pope Agatho.
 
During the Iconoclastic controversy similar collections were produced. Mention is made of one on the cult of relics and images which the Synod of Jerusalem sent to John, Bishop of Gothia, about 760. 

The oldest extant, and at the same time most extensive and valuable, of these dogmatic compilations, is the "Antiquorum Patrum doctrino de Verbi incarnatione" (first completely edited from a manuscript in the Vatican Library by F. Diekamp, "Doctrina Patrum de incarnatione verbi. Ein griechisches Florilegium aus der Wende des 7. und 8. Jahrhunderts", Münster, 1907). It is extraordinarily rich in fragments from writings of the Patristic period which are now lost. Of the 977 citations (mainly of a Christological character) which it contains, 751 alone are from the works of the Fathers, representing 93 ecclesiastical writers. Diekamp ascribes the work to the period between the years 685 and 726, and though nothing can be said with certainty concerning the author, a slight probability points to Anastasius of Sinai as its compiler.
 
A florilegium somewhat similar to the "Doctrina" is mentioned by Photius in his Bibliotheca (Migne, P.G., CLIII, 1089-92), but not a trace of it survives to-day. Another compilation of this kind, covering the whole province of theology in five books, is ascribed to the monk Doxopatres, identical perhaps with the eleventh-century John Doxopatres; the first two books, treating of Adam and Christ, are all that remain. A number of other dogmatic florilegia are still extant in manuscript form, but they have never been edited, nor even critically examined. The authors of most of them are unknown. 

The ascetical florilegia are collections of moral sentences and excerpts drawn partly from the Scriptures and partly from the Fathers, on such topics as virtues and vices, duties and exercises of a religious life, faith, discipline, etc. They are not so numerous as the dogmatic florilegia, and apparently were all compiled before the tenth century. Their material, as a rule, is gathered indiscriminately from various authorities, though in some instances it is furnished by only a single writer, a distinct preference being then shown for the works of the more illustrious Fathers, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and St. John Chrysostom. An extensive Christian florilegium of the sixth century, entitled tà  ierá (Sacred Things), is probably the earliest of these anthologies. The work consisted originally of three books, the first of which treated of God, the second of man, and the third of the virtues and vices. In the course of time it underwent contraction into one book, its material was recast and arranged in alphabetical order under títloi, or sections, its name changed to tà  ierà parállela, "Sacra Parallela" (from the fact that in the third book a virtue and a vice were regularly contrasted or paralleled), and its authorship widely ascribed to St. John Damascene. That the Damascene was really the compiler of the "Sacra Parallela", and that he used as his principal source the "Capita theologica", a florilegium of Maximus Confessor, has been maintained firmly (against Loofs, Wendland, and Cohn) by K. Holl ("Fragmenta Vornicänischer Kirchenväter aus den Sacra Parallela", Leipzig, 1899). Though tà  ierá is no longer extant in its original form, considerable portions of the first two books have come down to us in manuscript, and parts of the third are preserved in "The Bee" (Melissa) of Antonius, a Greek monk of the eleventh century (Migne, P. G., CXXXVI, 765-1124). Of the "Sacra Parallela" there are several recensions, one of which is given in Migne (P. G., XCV, 1040-1586; XCVI, 9-544). Other extant ascetical florilegia still remain unedited. As in the case of the dogmatic florilegia, most of them are anonymous. 

The character and value of the Christian florilegia cannot be definitely or finally estimated until the various manuscripts that now lie scattered through the libraries of Europe and the East have received a more thorough and critical investigation than has hitherto been accorded to them. Questions as to date, authorship, sources, structure, relative dependence, etc., have as yet been treated only in a general way. As the characteristic production of an age of theological decadence, these collections of ancient Christian fragments have no high literary value; they are, however, of great importance to us, because they frequently embody the only remains of important Patristic writings. The difficulties connected with their uses arise chiefly from the unsatisfactory condition of the text, the uncertainty concerning the names to which the fragments have been ascribed, and the want of sufficient data to determine the dates. Only a small part of the extant material has been printed.

The Vultee P-66 Vanguard was an accidental addition to the USAAF's inventory of fighter aircraft. It was initially ordered by Sweden, but by the time the aircraft were ready for delivery in 1941, the United States would not allow them to be exported. Eventually, 129 were sent to China, with the Army Air Force keeping 15 and designating them as P-66s. They were used as trainers in America during World War II.

Development.
The Vultee P-66 was the product of an idea conceived in the late 1930s by the Vultee Aircraft Division of the Aviation Manufacturing Corporation of developing four aircraft designed for different roles from a set of common wings and aft fuselage and tail assemblies. The company assigned four model designations: V-48 to a single seat fighter, BC-51 to a basic combat trainer, B-54 to an advanced trainer, and BC-54D as a basic trainer. Eventually the BC-51 would become the Army Air Corps BC-3 and the BC-54D the BT-13.

In 1938, the detailed design of the V-48 fighter member of the quartet began. The aircraft featured a metal covered semi-monocoque fuselage and fully retractable landing gear powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1830 radial air-cooled engine. During construction of the first prototype a decision was made to lengthen the propeller shaft and install a tight cowling to provide a pointed nose to reduce drag. In September 1939 the first aircraft flew, and was assigned NX21755 registration number. The name Vanguard was given to the airplane. At once, in flight test the aircraft was suffering from inadequate cooling. Measures to modify the cooling ducting were of little avail. After re-evaluating the design, and noting that the insignificant drag decrease was not worth the added weight and ducting problems, the second prototype, which was assigned a model number of V-48X and registration of NX19999, was finished with a conventional cowl, and the first aircraft was also modified. This second aircraft first flew on February 11, 1940. As a result of flight tests a number of changes were made to the design including substantially increasing the areas of the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces.

On February 6, 1940, the Swedish government ordered 144 Vanguards from Vultee. To these Vultee assigned a model designation of V-49C. The production prototype flew on September 6, 1940. The model V-49C was similar to the V-48X except for installation of a later version of the R-1830 engine with better higher altitude performance and provision for four 0.3 in wing mounted machineguns and two 0.5 in fuselage guns.

When production deliveries began in September 1941 the U.S. government placed an embargo on exporting the aircraft to Sweden. The British government took over the contract with plans to use the Vanguard as an advanced trainer in Canada. However, the British then relinquished the aircraft for China to whom 129 Vanguards were shipped under the Lend-Lease program. The remaining aircraft were retained by the U.S.A.A.F. and used at pursuit training bases in the Western U.S. These aircraft were assigned the designation of P-66. Production ended in April 1942.

Miami Sunset Senior High School is a secondary school located at 13125 SW 72nd Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida; its principal is Lucia Cox. The school is part of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools System.

Sunset was built in 1977 and opened its doors that same year. Beginning in the late 1990s, Sunset became one of many overcrowded schools in the county, due to the recent population explosion in the metropolitan area. This forced the school district to build two other schools in the area, Felix Varela High School and John A. Ferguson High School, to relieve overcrowding at Sunset and other nearby high schools.

Academics.
This school was given a grade of "C" by the Florida Department of Education in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. It was only a few points away from receiving a "B" grade.

Athletics.
The Athletic Director is George Phelan.

Miami Sunset's soccer team were the National Champions in 2004 and 2005.

The school's primary athletic rivals include Felix Varela High School, G. Holmes Braddock High School, and Miami Killian High School.

One prominent athletic alumnus is Raul Ibanez, in 2006, an outfielder for the Seattle Mariners.

Alma mater lyrics.
Sunset High to you we are loyal
long keep your standards high
Like the knights of old, let us uphold
our colors the silver, black, and gold
We believe in fairness and justice
these let us not deny
That when all is said and done we will always stand as one
and we'll honor you our Sunset High!

Déprimisme ("depressionism") is a contemporary French art and literary movement, in which authors dwell on the failures of society. The movement can be identified as a cross between expressionism and symbolism. Originally a French movement, the term has later been extended to refer to direct commentary on any contemporary, particularly western or American culture. In a general sense, "depressionism" is the practice of manipulating social ideas and conventions in such a way as to illicit an emotional or intellectual effect from the audience.

For example, in a painting of this genre, the artist would use the the actual physical texture and form of a painting to depict not only the subject matter, but the implied emotional state of the subject in his/her environment. The resulting painting is ultimately a distortion of reality intermingled with social commentary.  Michel Houellebecq's 1998 novel The Elementary Particles is considered a primary work.

Antoine de Sartine was born in Barcelona in 1729, the son of Antoine Sartine, a French-born financier who arrived in Spain with the troops of King Philip V of Spain and served as intendente (i.e. governor) of Catalonia from 1726 to 1744. His mother was Catherine Wilts, Countess of Alby.

After the death of his mother, Antoine de Sartine was sent to France and put under the guidance of Charles Colabeau, businessman and friend of his father. He studied law in Paris. In 1752 he was granted letters of naturalization. The same year, at the age of 23, he became Councilor (i.e. judge) at the Châtelet of Paris, the city's civil and criminal court. In 1755 he bought the office of Criminal Lieutenant, i.e. head, or chief judge, of the Châtelet's criminal branch. As a result of buying this office, he was ennobled and entered the prestigious aristocracy. Eventually, in 1759, he married Marie-Anne Hardy du Plessis, the grand-daughter of Charles Colabeau. 

By then, he was in favor at the court of Versailles, and so on November 21 1759 he was appointed Lieutenant General of Police of Paris (i.e. head of the Paris Police). He entered office in December of that year after buying the office of Lieutenant General of Police from his predecessor Bertin for the sum of 175,000 livres (approx. US$850,000 in 2006), which his friend Malesherbes advanced him.

Lieutenant General of Police of Paris.
As Lieutenant General of Police, Antoine de Sartine was the real administrator of Paris for 15 years, invested with more powers than the Provost of the Merchants (head of the Paris municipality). Like his predecessors, he was in charge not only of public order, but also of street cleaning and maintenance, food supply, and public health and hygiene.

A skilled administrator, he improved the city's food supply. Along with the Provost of the Merchants de Viarmes, he commissioned the building of a new grain market, the Halle au blé, built between 1765 and 1768, a modern and airy building much admired at the time which is still standing by Les Halles today and currently known as the Bourse du Commerce.

Street cleaning and lighting were also improved. He set up a brigade of street sweepers and had the first public toilets installed in the streets of Paris. In 1766, after launching an invention contest, he improved street lighting by installing new réverbère lanterns. These were oil lamps with reflectors which were hung above the center of streets and produced a more abundant and stable light than the candle lanterns that had been used for centuries before. 

The same year, he founded the Royal Free Drawing School (now the National School of Decorative Arts) which taught drawing skills, free-of-charge, to the sons of families from the lowest classes of society. The aim was both to train artisans and artists so as to improve the quality of the Parisian luxury goods industries and handicrafts, but also to teach poor youths a trade and keep them from roaming the streets and disturbing public order.

For the first time in history, he conducted a survey of the quarries beneath the city, many of which threatened the foundations of buildings. He also ordered fourteen public fountains restored and organized drowning assistance services. 

Under his tenure, public order was well maintained in the French capital. He took great care in the recruitment of police commissioners (commissaires de police) to assist him. He is said to have fulfilled his office with justice, humanity, firmness, and vigilance, and was highly respected by everyone.

Among other measures, he subjected the night watchmen to military discipline; he put an end to the abuse of the claque in theatres; he banned gatherings of horn blowers in pubs. In order to suppress underground gambling dives in the city, he opened official gambling houses watched over by his agents and taxed by the Treasury. 

His services, in particular secret police, were the best informed in Europe and served as a model in other countries. All the governments of Europe, Catherine II of Russia, Maria Theresa of Austria, the Pope, consulted him on the best way to organize police services in their states. He had agents and spies everywhere in the city and abroad, including as far away as in America and in India. Such was his reputation that foreign governments often required his help in searching for fugitives. Once, a minister of Maria Theresa wrote to Sartine asking him to arrest a famous thief who was thought to be hiding in Paris. Sartine replied to the minister that the thief was actually in Vienna, and gave the minister the street address where the thief was hiding, as well as a description of the thief's disguise. 

Sartine personally analyzed an enormous correspondence and received his subordinates and commissioners of police anytime of day and night. He was the first to use repentant thieves and reprieved convicts as informants and agents. To courtiers who found this shocking, he used to say: "Pray tell me the name of honest people who would like to do such a job." Sartine was also a man of action, with great presence of mind. On one occasion, having to quell a riot on the Place Maubert, he met the crowd at the head of a company of musketeers and had an officer respectfully remove his hat and tell the crowd: "Gentlemen, we come here in the name of the King, but our orders are to shoot at the scoundrels only. I therefore pray the honest people to leave the square." The crowd disbanded without a gunshot.

Although admired by his contemporaries, he was also criticized for using his highly efficient secret police to spy not only on criminals but also on ordinary citizens. His services opened private letters sent through the mail, which was a frequent practice in Europe at the time, and spied on families. Sartine was thus aware of all sorts of scandals in the city, notably sexual scandals, and he sent daily reports to the king containing saucy and intimate details about courtiers, clerics, and private citizens, which were said to amuse the king and relieve him from the boredom of court life. Furthermore, his political police was known for its efficiency in detecting agitators, dissenters, anticlerical propagandists, and other people perceived as trouble makers, who were imprisoned without trial through the lettres de cachet. Some sources say that there were never more political prisoners at the Bastille and at the fortress of Vincennes than under his tenure.

In parallel with his career as Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, Antoine de Sartine became maître des requêtes in December 1759 and conseiller d'État in 1767. He was the director of the Library from 1763 to 1774, succeeding his friend Malesherbes. As such, he was not only in charge of managing the Royal Library (now the National Library of France), but he was also the chief censor in the kingdom, responsible for controlling the book trade and the press. Like his friend Malesherbes, he was a liberal and supported the philosophers of The Enlightenment, in particular Diderot and his Encyclopédie, which he protected against the attacks of the ecclesiastical party.

Antoine de Sartine was close to the party of the minister Choiseul, who had been disgraced by Louis XV in 1770 and ordered to retire to his estate. After the king's death in May 1774, Choiseul was allowed to return to Paris and his party regained favor at court. Thus, on August 24 of the same year, Sartine was appointed Secretary of State for the Navy (with the honorific rank of Minister of State in 1775) and left his office of Lieutenant General of Police to his protégé Lenoir.

Secretary of State for the Navy.
Antoine de Sartine inherited a strong French Navy, resurrected by Choiseul after the disasters of the Seven Years' War when France lost Canada, Louisiana, and India, and which would later defeat the British Navy in the War of American Independence. In the ministry, Sartine surrounded himself with able men, such as the comte de Fleurieu. He modernized and rationalized the French Navy. By seven decrees (September 27, 1776), he gave naval officers the high hand over French ports and naval dockyards, which were put under the direction of the comte de Fleurieu. He also reorganized the corps of naval artillery and marine infantry. In 1775, after the aborted attempt by his predecessor to create a Royal Marine School in Le Havre, he re-established the Companies of Marine Guards, naval schools training officers and whose access was strictly limited to children of the aristocracy.

As conflict with England was looming on the horizon, he increased shipbuilding budgets fourfold, enabling large scale shipbuilding when France entered the American War of Independence in the beginning of 1778. In the space of only one year, nine battleships were built in the French shipyards. Sartine also initiated the building of the long breakwater which protects the port of Cherbourg and commissioned the construction of dry docks in Brest, Rochefort, Lorient, and Toulon. Particularly interested in foundries, he created the naval foundry of Indret near Nantes (now a unit of DCN specialized in conventional and nuclear propulsion). In these critical times, he fought successfully against insubordination in the Navy, notably by publishing a regulation in 1780 dealing with hygiene onboard the vessels of the fleet and with marine crew health issues. Drawing from his police experience, he also used his spy network in the fight against England.

The budget deficit, which was aggravated by France's participation in the War of American Independence, led to conflict between the finance minister, Necker, who sought to limit expenditures, and Sartine, who wanted to expand the French Navy even further. Necker accused Sartine of exceeding the budget allocated to the Navy by 20 million livres (approx. US$100 million in 2006). Necker complained sharply to King Louis XVI that this overrun threatened an already almost bankrupt State. Eventually, the king dismissed Sartine on October 14, 1780 and replaced him with the marquis de Castries. Sartine, however, was dismissed with honors: he received a reward of 150,000 livres (approx. US$700,000) for his services and he was granted a 70,000 livres yearly pension.

Antoine de Sartine tried to justify his actions as minister in a vitriolic pamphlet against Necker, whom he accused of having sold himself to the English, but he didn't win over the public and was the victim of numerous puns and epigrams such as this one:
I swept Paris with extreme care,;
And, wishing to sweep the English from the seas,;
I sold my broom so dearly;
That I was swept away myself.;

Later years.
Sartine lived in retirement in Paris until the start of the French Revolution. Hated by the revolutionary crowds for his tenure as Lieutenant General of Police and his use of the lettres de cachet to imprison people without trial, attacked by Manuel in his La Police de Paris dévoilée ("The Paris Police Uncovered"), he decided to leave France shortly after the Storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, which probably saved his life. His son Charles Marie Antoine de Sartine, born in 1760, who was maître des requêtes from the age of 20 until 1791 and chose to stay in France, was arrested in 1794, sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal, and guillotined on June 17 of that year along with his 19-year-old wife and his mother-in-law the comtesse de Sainte-Amaranthe.

Sartine took refuge in Barcelona, where he had spent his childhood. There, he was active among émigré circles. Around 1797 he retired to Tarragona, where he was a member of the enlightened circle of Archbishop Francisco Armañá y Font (Francesc Armanyà i Font). He died in Tarragona in 1801 at the age of 72 without having returned to France.

A parabolic trough is a type of solar thermal collector. It is constructed as a long parabolic mirror (usually coated silver or polished aluminum) with a Dewar tube running its length at the focal point. Sunlight is reflected by the mirror and concentrated on the Dewar tube.  The trough is usually aligned on a north-south axis, and rotated to track the sun.  Heat transfer fluid (usually oil) runs through the tube to absorb the concentrated sunlight.  The heat transfer fluid is then used to heat steam in a standard turbine generator.  The process is economical and, for heating the pipe, thermal efficiency ranges from 60-80%.

Current commercial plants utilizing parabolic troughs are hybrids, fossil fuels are used during night hours, but the amount of fossil fuel used is limited to a maximum 27% of electricity production, so that the plant qualifies as a renewable energy source. Because they are hybrids and include cooling stations, condensers, accumulators and other things besides the actual solar collectors, the kWh per square meter of space ranges enormously. 

The largest operational solar power system at present is of this type. It is one of the SEGS plants and is located at Kramer Junction in California, USA, with five fields of 33MW generation capacity each.

The 64 MW Nevada Solar One will also use this technology. In the new Spanish plant, Andasol 1, the 'Eurotrough'-collector will be used. This plant will be built in 2006/2007 and has a nominal output of 49.9 MW.

Leo and Diane Dillon are a prolific American husband and wife team of illustrators. Leo was raised in Brooklyn, and Diane in the Los Angeles area.  They met at the Parsons School of Design in NYC in 1953, some time after Diane moved from California to New York.  They graduated from Parsons in 1956, and eventually married in March 1957.  They describe their work as incorporating motifs derived from their respective heritages. They have worked on both on children's literature and adult paperbacks. An association with writer Harlan Ellison led to jobs doing book covers for his short story collections and both cover and interior woodcut illustration for his anthology Dangerous Visions.  Other jobs in the science fiction field include every one of their covers for the original Ace Science Fiction Specials. 

A detailed biography and introduction to their work and styles was written by the late Byron Preiss in a book he edited in 1981, The Art of Leo & Diane Dillon.

<doc id="2334154" title="Debruce, New York" nonfiltered="1234" processed="1219" dbindex="1481246">
Debruce is a small hamlet located in Sullivan County, New York. 
 Geography .
Debruce is about 5 miles east of Livingston Manor, New York, on the confluence of Willowemoc Creek and Mongaup Creek.
It is located at 41°55' North, 74°44' West (41.917, -74.733)

 History .
Debruce was once a resort town, catering to fly fishermen.  George LeBranch, author of The Dry Fly and Fast Water in 1914, who had his home in Debruce, famously cast his first dry fly there.  The DeBruce Club Inn, first owned by Charles B. Ward, was also there.  The Inn offered a nine hole golf course, tennis courts and fishing on several miles of the choicest water on the upper Willowemoc.   During its heydays in the 1930s and 1940s it was a popular destination for sportsmen from the city, famous for its food and smiling hostesses. In the early 1900s one of LeBranch's favorite dry flies was called the pink lady--pale pink floss ribbed with gold tinsel, duck wings, ginger hackle and tail on a #12 hook.  Amusingly, a favorite drink at the Inn was also called the pink lady--gin, grenadine, apple brandy, lemon juice and cracked ice, strained into a stemmed glass.  The Inn was torn down in 1970.

DeBruce was, in its earliest days, a site for one of the Catskills' largest tanneries, employing over 100 men shortly after it was established in 1856.  This industry relied on the easy availability of water and hemlock trees--its bark was one of the cheapest supplies of tannin available.  The trees were cut  down (about 5% of the forests thereabouts were hemlocks) and their bark was peeled off, leaving the timber to rot.  The leather was processed in factories near the water and often actually in the forest.  The industry quickly depleted the trees, peaking in about 1870, and was entirely gone from the Catskills by 1895, much to the relief of the trout fishermen, no doubt.

 Labor Day Parade .



Today, the town is renown for its "DeBruce Family Labor Day Parade."  Held annually since 1993, it brings the entire community (many, if not most, summer people) out to celebrate the Autumn harvest, the end of summer, or just to be together one more year.  It is ably organized by Steve Dill (pictured) who enthusiatically energizes his friends and neighbors into a frenzy of speech-making, face-painting, dancing, games, food, costumes and assorted show-and-tells.  Often there is a King or Queen of the parade--Floyd Cook, the 94-year old "Mayor of the Hill" has had this honor several times.  An unusual feature of the parade is its shortness.  The course, which starts from Dill's front yard, stretches over about one city block, which is considerably shorter than the line of marchers and vehicles in it.  Sort of circular, you might say...  

In 2006 the parade featured the MountainTones Marching band, and hayrides for the kids.

<doc id="718884" title="Massacre of Lwów professors" nonfiltered="1239" processed="1224" dbindex="1481251">
The murder of Lwów professors was the mass execution of approximately 45 Polish professors of the University of Lwów (John Casimir University/Uniwersytet Jana Kazimierza), their families and guests, committed in July 1941 in Lwów (Lviv) then occupied by Nazi Germany in the World War II. The mass murder was a continuation of AB Action, or Ausserordentliche Befriedungsaktion started in 1940.

History.
After the German invasion of the Soviet Union started in 1941, Lwów was captured on June 30. Along with the Wehrmacht, a number of smaller Abwehr units entered the city. Aided by the Ukrainian Nachtigall battalion under Roman Shuhevych and several units of Ukrainian militia, they started mass executions of people previously put on proscription lists.

Most of the Jewish inhabitants of the city were shot on the spot while members of other ethnic groups were first transported to execution sites in the Gestapo prison at Pe czy ska street, Brygidki Prison, former military prison at Zamarstynów and to the fields surrounding the city: in Winniki suburb, Kortumówki hills and the Jewish Cemetery. Most of the people on the lists were Polish politicians, artists, sportsmen, scientists and priests.

By July 2, 1941, most of the terror actions were halted, yet the individual, planned terror continued. At approximately 3 o'clock in the evening prof. Kazimierz Bartel was arrested by one of the Einsatzkommandos operating in the area.

During the night of July 3 and July 4 several dozens of professors and their families were arrested. The lists were prepared by their Ukrainian students. In the early morning of July 4 one of the professors and most of the servants were set free while the rest were either brought to the execution place in the Wulka hills or shot to death in the courtyard of the Bursa Abrahamowiczów building. The victims were at first buried on the spot, but several days after the massacre their bodies were exhumed and transported by the Wehrmacht to an unknown place.

Methodology of the crime.
There are accounts of four different methods used by the German and Ukrainian troops. The victims were either:
Beaten to death;
Killed with a bayonet;
Killed with a hammer;
or shot to death;

The professors themselves were shot to death, although it is highly probable that at least two of them were buried alive.

Aftermath.
After World War II the government of the Soviet Union, which now controlled the city, tried to erase the Polish history of the city of Lwów. Because of that the crimes committed by the Germans and Ukrainians east of the so-called Curzon line were not prosecuted by the Polish courts and the informations on Polish universities in Lwów were censored. However, in 1960 dr Helena Krukowska, the widow of Prof. dr W odzimierz Krukowski managed to appeal to the court in Hamburg. After five years the German court closed the judicial proceeding. Public prosecutor von Beelow argued that the people responsible for the crime were already dead. However, this was not true since at the same time SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Krüger, commander of the Gestapo unit supervising the massacres in Lwów in 1941 was being held in Hamburg prison (he was sentenced to life imprisonment for mass murder of Jews and Poles in Stanis awów, committed several weeks after his unit was transferred from Lvov). No person was ever held responsible for the massacre.

In the 1970s the Abrahamowicz street in Lviv was renamed to Tadeusz Boy- ele ski street. However, the pleas of various Polish organisations to commemorate the victims of the massacre with a monument or a symbolical grave in Lviv have been rejected ever since. The case of the murder of the professors is currently under investigation by the Institute of National Remembrance.

The 2006 FIBA World Championship was an international basketball competition hosted by Japan from August 19 to September 3, 2006.  It was co-organised by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), Japan Basketball Association (JABBA) and the 2006 Organizing Committee.

For the first time since 1986, the World Championship was contested by 24 nations, eight more than in 2002.  As a result, group rounds were conducted in four different cities, with the knockout round's being hosted by Saitama City.

The tournament was won by Spain, who, in the championship final, beat Greece, 70-47, to finish the tournament having won all nine games played.  The bronze medal was won by the United States, who defeated Argentina, 96-81, in the third place game

Competing nations.
The following national teams competed:

 


Japan qualified as the host country, and Italy, Puerto Rico, Serbia & Montenegro, and Turkey gained FIBA wild-card invitations.  Argentina qualified as the champion of the 2004 Olympics.  The remaining 18 countries qualified through their continents' qualifying tournments (six from Europe, four from the Americas, three from each of Asia and Africa and two from Oceania).

The draw for 2006 World Championship was held in Tokyo on 15 January 2006.  In the preliminary rounds, Group A played at Sendai, Group B at Hiroshima, Group C at Hamamatsu and Group D at Sapporo. The Medal Rounds were played at Saitama.

Final.

The final was an unexpectedly one-sided affair, with Spain dominating from the beginning and limiting Greece to just 47 points, fewer than the Greek or any other side had scored in any single game in the tournament, and less than half what Greece had scored against the USA in the semifinals.  Spain won despite having lost power forward Pau Gasol, ultimately named the tournament's most valuable player, to injury in a semifinal match against Argentina.

Final standings.


Referees.
For the World Championship, FIBA selected 40 professional referees.

The Kocher-Debré-Semelaigne syndrome is a (myopathy) of hypothyroidism in infancy or childhood characterised by lower extremity or generalized muscular hypertrophy, myxoedema, short stature and cretinism. The absence of painful spasms and pseudomyotonia differentiates this syndrome from Hoffmann syndrome.

The syndrome is named after Emil Theodor Kocher, Robert Debré and Georges Semélaigne.

Also known as Debre-Semelaigne syndrome or cretinism-muscular hypertrophy, hypothyroid myopathy, hypothyroidism-large muscle syndrome, hypothyreotic muscular hypertrophy in children, infantile myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy, myopathy-myxoedema syndrome, myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy syndrome, myxoedema-myotonic dystrophy syndrome.

<doc id="780991" title="Command line argument" nonfiltered="1242" processed="1227" dbindex="1481254">
In computer command line interfaces, a command line argument is an argument sent to a program being called. In general, a program can take any number of command line arguments, which may be necessary for the program to run, or may even be ignored, depending on the function of that program.

For example, in the popular Unix environment, an example of a command-line argument is:
rm file.s;
"file.s" is a command line argument which tells the program rm to remove the file "file.s".

Command-line switch.

A command line switch or simply switch (also known as a flag, an option, or a command line parameter) is an indication by a user that a computer program should change its default behaviour.

For example, in the OpenVMS operating system, the command directory is used to list the files inside a directory.  By default that is, when the user simply types directory it will list only the names of the files.  By adding the switch /owner (to form the command directory/owner), the user can instruct the directory command to also display the ownership of the files.

The format of switches varies widely between operating systems.  Under the OpenVMS operating system, switches are entered in the form command/switch_1/switch_2/switch_3=value etc.  The form /switch=value is used to provide an argument to the switch; for example, /user=john might specify that only files owned by the user "john" should be displayed.

MS-DOS and related operating systems typically use single-letter switches, for example dir/w/p/a:s.  In this case, the : character serves the same purpose as = above.

Traditionally, the Unix operating system is similar to MS-DOS; switches are single letters, and introduced via a - (hyphen); e.g. ls -l -F -a. When options are given in this form (a dash and then a letter or word), they are more often called flags - as in compiler flags. Multiple flags may be combined into one, so the previous command could be rewritten ls -lFa.  However, with the increasingly widespread use of software from the GNU project, particularly in the Linux operating system, GNU's "long options" are also widely used.  Long options are introduced via --, and are typically whole words. For example, ls --long --classify --all.  Arguments to long options are provided with =, as ls --block-size=1024.

GNU -- is also used to terminate option list. This is very practical; for example, if one has file called -file1, and wants delete it by typing rm -file1, rm might think that -file1 is command line switch, and produce an error. Using rm -- -file1 removes ambiguity.

Im Juli. (English: In July) is a 2000 German road movie directed by Fatih Ak n and starring Moritz Bleibtreu and Christiane Paul. The film takes place in July, 1999, and features a solar eclipse, which actually took place on August 11,1999.

 Plot .

At the beginning of his summer holiday, a somewhat naïve trainee teacher Daniel (Moritz Bleibtreu) buys a ring from a stall run by Juli (Christiane Paul).The ring bears a Mayan sun symbol, which, according to Juli, has the power to lead him to the woman of his dreams, whom he will recognise by a similar sun symbol. As Juli has the ring's counterpart, and as she has fallen in love with him, she invites Daniel to a party that evening, in the hope that they will meet.

Curious, Daniel goes to the party and meets Melek (dil Üner), who is wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a sun symbol. Convinced that she is the woman of his dreams, Daniel talks to her. Melek is only passing through and looking for a place to spend the night. After spending some time together seeing the sights of Hamburg, Daniel invites her to spend the night in his apartment.

Daniel and Melek left the party just as Juli arrived. She saw them leave together. In her disappointment, she decides to leave town. Next day she goes to the Autobahn to hitch a ride, with no predetermined destination.

As fate would have it, Daniel is the first car to stop, on his way back from the airport, where he had dropped Melek off. He has decided to drive to Istanbul in search of Melek, who, he knows, will be under the bridge over the Bosporus a few days later. Juli convinces Daniel to take her with him in his neighbour's rusty old car. And so begins a long and exciting trip across Eastern Europe.

<doc id="8709951" title="Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle" nonfiltered="1245" processed="1230" dbindex="1481257">


Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, born in 1922 in Algiers and executed in that city on December 26, 1942, was a member of the French resistance who shot Admiral of the Fleet François Darlan, the former chief of government of Vichy France and the self-named high commissioner of French North Africa and West Africa, on December 24 1942. For this act, Bonnier de La Chapelle is considered a hero of the French resistance to Nazi tyranny in World War II.

A student at the Lycée Stanislas in Paris after France's surrender to Nazi Germany on June 22, 1940, Bonnier de La Chapelle participated in an anti-German student demonstration at the Arc de Triomphe on Armistice Day, November 11, 1940. He then crossed in secret the demarcation line between German-occupied France and Vichy France and made his way to Algiers, where his father was a journalist. Having passed his baccalauréat examination in 1942, he was surprised by the Allied landings in North Africa (Operation Torch) on November 8, 1940 and by the participation of many of his friends in the so-called putsch of November 8, in which the resistance seized control of several Vichy government offices and headquarters in Algiers. An ardent anti-Vichyite, he regretted that his friends had not asked him to take part in the putsch.

After Darlan surrendered Algiers to Allied forces, the continuation of Vichyite government in Algeria under his direction caused consternation among members of the French resistance. Bonnier de La Chapelle and three friends decided to eliminate the Admiral, and Bonnier de La Chapelle drew the short straw. Having obtained a revolver, Bonnier on December 24, 1942 waited in a corridor of the Summer Palace (Palais d Été), the admiral's headquarters in Algiers, for Darlan to return to his office. He shot Darlan twice, once in the face and once in the chest, and then shot the admiral's aide-de-camp in the thigh. At that point, the occupants of the other offices in the Palais effected his capture.

A military tribunal was convened the next day, December 25. Bonnier de La Chapelle declared that he had acted alone, and he was condemned to death. He was executed by firing squad on December 26, 1942. On December 21, 1945, the Court of Appeals of Algiers overturned his conviction, stating that he had acted "in the interest of the liberation of France."

Carl Side is a fell in the English Lake District, forming part of Skiddaw "family". It is listed in Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells as one of the Northern Fells. 

Carl Side is often climbed via Ullock Pike and Long Side, along a narrow ridge. Wainwright also suggested ascents from Little Crosthwaite, High Side and Millbeck. Carl Side is bordered by Southerndale Beck, in the little-known valley of Southerndale, and Mill Beck. All streams from the fell go into Bassenthwaite Lake. Carl Side has connecting ridges to Skiddaw and Dodd, and Carl Side is probably climbed mainly by walkers going on to the more renowned height of Skiddaw.

Carl Side is near the town of Keswick, and can be seen prominently from its streets. The view south from the top is restricted due to the broadness of the summit.

<doc id="6295014" title="Holden VY Commodore" nonfiltered="1247" processed="1232" dbindex="1481259">


The Holden VY Commodore was produced between September 2002 and August 2004. The VY Commodore was the successor to the Holden VX Commodore and in August 2003 a Series II of the VY series was released. But in August 2004 the VY series made way for the updated Holden VZ Commodore range.

The VY Commodore is much more refined than the previous model in many aspects including the body structure, powertrain and chassis dynamics delivering appreciable improvements in performance, ride, handling, safety and build quality.

The VY Commodore was available in several models. These are the Executive, Acclaim, Berlina, Calais, S, SV8, and the SS. All the models in the VY range were sedans, but the Executive, Acclaim and Berlina models were also available in wagon form. Unusually, the VY also introduced a limited edition SS wagon featuring the same 235 kW (245 kW for Series II) V8, bodykit and sports suspension as the SS sedan. However, it was equipped with 17-inch alloy wheels as opposed to the 18 inch wheels on the sedan. 500 such wagons were produced for Series I and 350 for Series II.

The front and rear of the body has been completely restyled, with new front grille and headlights, and taillights. As with the exterior the interior has been also been heavily upgraded. Interior upgrade includes a new instrument panel, centre console and steering wheel, and new design transmission shifter and handbrake. There is also a new mobile phone power outlet under the centre console. The new instrument cluster features a large multi-function digital display (single or triple-window, depending on model), which displays information such as radio station display, PRNDL gear selected indicator, trip computer with stopwatch function, service reminders and a help facility.

Standard features now include "twilight sentinel" (on some models) automatic headlamp control, headlamps off programmable time delay, high feature Blaupunkt audio systems, road-speed sensitive intermittent wipers and passenger airbags.

The VY Series II update introduced a 245 kW V8 to sports variants and a sportier repositioning of the Calais model. This repositioning included a subtle body kit, the option of a 235 kW V8 in place of the previous 225 kW and a firmer suspension tune (known as FE 1.5) that was not as stiff as the FE2 suspension on sports variants.

Chief Tenaya (?-1853) was a Native American chief in the Yosemite Valley people in California.
Tenaya's father was the chief of the Ahwahneechee , which means "people of the Ahwahnee" (Yosemite Valley). The Ahwahneechees were a totally different tribe then any other surrounding tribes. Lafayette Bunnell, the doctor of the Mariposa Battalion, wrote that "Ten-ie-ya was recognized, by the Mono tribe, as one of their number, as he was born and lived among them until his ambition made him a leader and founder of the Pai-Ute colony in Ah-wah-ne." 

The Ahwahneechee occupied Yosemite Valley until a sickness destroyed most of them.
The few Ahwahneechee left Yosemite Valley and joined the Mono Lake Paiutes in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Tenaya's father married a Mono Paiute woman and Tenaya was born from that union. Tenaya grow up amongst his mothers people and married a Mono Paiute woman and had several children. Fifty years later a medicine man advised Tenaya that it was time to return to the beautiful Yosemite Valley because the sickness was gone. Tenaya took about 200 people back into Yosemite Valley. 
The Ahwahneechee were a powerful tribe feared by the surrounding Miwok tribes.
The surrounding tribes called them Yosemite meaning "they are killers."

By 1851, conflicts between the non-indigenous miners and the Native Americans in the Sierra started to increase. The state of California decided to send the Natives to reservations. The Mariposa Brigade was formed to carry out the relocation. Chief Tenaya agreed to move to the Fresno Reservation, instead of the destruction of his entire band. Many of his band left Yosemite Valley instead of following Tenaya. As they approached the Fresno reservation, they fled back to the Yosemite Valley. The Brigade then re-entered the Valley, captured Tenaya's sons, and killed his youngest son. Tenaya then agreed to go back to the reservation.

By the summer of 1851, Tenaya grew tired of the reservation. He gave his pledge that he would not disturb any non-indigenous people. However, in 1852, a group of prospectors were killed in the Valley. Tenaya and his band fled to join the Mono Paiutes. He returned to the Valley in 1853. He was stoned to death in a dispute with the Mono Paiutes over stolen horses.

Tenaya Lake was named after Chief Tenaya.

Makaturing Volcano, or Mount Makaturing, is a stratovolcano on Mindanao island in the Philippines. It is found in the province of Lanao del Sur in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (7°38.5 N, 124°20.5 E).

Makaturing has an elevation of 1,908 meters and a base diameter of 29 kms and is part of a string of volcanos called the Central Mindanao Arc.

Eruptions.
There is still some controversy on the number of times Makaturing erupted. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology lists 10 eruptions with the last one occurring on March 18, 1882. But the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanology Program, citing the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (Neumann van Padang, 1953), asserts that some eruptions were actually those of neighboring Ragang volcano.  

Makaturing is one of the 22 active volcanoes in the Philippines: Babuyan Claro, Banahaw, Bulusan, Mount Biliran, Bud Dajo, Cagua, Camiguin de Babuyanes, Didicas, Hibok-Hibok, Iraya, Mount Iriga, Mount Kanlaon, Leonard Kniaseff, Matutum, Mayon, Musuan, Mount Parker (Cotabato), Pinatubo, Ragang, Smith Volcano, Taal. They are all part of the so-called "Pacific ring of fire."

Trivia.
On May 18, 1947, Philippine Air Force (PAF) commander Gen. Edwin Andrews died with 16 others when the C-47 transport plane carrying them crashed in Makaturing. Nine years later, the PAF established an air base in Zamboanga City and is now named the Edwin Andrews Air Base from where the Philippine military launch air support operations in the ongoing campaign against communist and Muslim insurgents.

Rank and organization: Colonel, U.S. Marine Corps, commanding officer of all Marine Corps troops on Betio Island, Tarawa Atoll, and Gilbert Islands, from 20 to 22 November 1943.  

The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to

COLONEL DAVID M. SHOUP
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of all Marine Corps troops in action against enemy Japanese forces on Betio Island, Tarawa Atoll, Gilbert Islands, from 20 to 22 November 1943. Although severely shocked by an exploding enemy shell soon after landing at the pier and suffering from a serious, painful leg wound which had become infected, Col. Shoup fearlessly exposed himself to the terrific and relentless artillery, machinegun, and rifle fire from hostile shore emplacements. Rallying his hesitant troops by his own inspiring heroism, he gallantly led them across the fringing reefs to charge the heavily fortified island and reinforce our hard-pressed, thinly held lines. Upon arrival on shore, he assumed command of all landed troops and, working without rest under constant, withering enemy fire during the next 2 days, conducted smashing attacks against unbelievably strong and fanatically defended Japanese positions despite innumerable obstacles and heavy casualties. By his brilliant leadership daring tactics, and selfless devotion to duty, Col. Shoup was largely responsible for the final decisive defeat of the enemy, and his indomitable fighting spirit reflects great credit upon the U.S. Naval Service.;

<doc id="5425800" title="Getaway (The Saint)" nonfiltered="1267" processed="1250" dbindex="1481279">


Getaway is the title of a mystery novel by Leslie Charteris first published in the United Kingdom in 1932 by Hodder and Stoughton. This was the fifth full-length novel featuring the adventures of the modern day Robin Hood-inspired crimebuster Simon Templar, and the ninth Saint book published overall since 1928. When first published in the United States by The Crime Club, the title was modified to The Saint's Getaway which was later adopted by future UK editions.

Prior to being published in book form, Getaway had appeared in magazines under the titles Property of the Deceased and Two Men from Munich.

Charteris, in his introduction to a mid-1960s reprint of the book for Fiction Publishing Company, describes Getaway as the third part of a trilogy of novels that began with The Last Hero and Knight Templar.

Plot summary.
The novel begins approximately three weeks after the events of the story "The Melancholy Journey of Mr. Teal" in The Holy Terror. Simon Templar, accompanied by his lover/partner Patricia Holm, has departed England on a well-deserved holiday from crime-fighting. 

While visiting Innsbruck, Austria with their friend, book editor Monty Hayward (making his first appearance in the series), the trio are out for a late-night walk when they see a man being attacked by thugs. They stop the attack, but the victim is particularly ungrateful, forcing Templar to knock him out, too. Intrigued by the man's attitude -- as well as by a steel box attached to his wrist (which later turns out to be a miniature safe filled with recently-stolen diamonds), Templar decides to take the unconscious man back to his hotel room. Before long, however, the man is stabbed to death in Templar's bed and Templar finds himself in yet another encounter with Prince Rudolf -- one of the men responsible for the death of his friend Norman Kent in The Last Hero. 

Simon and Patricia (with very reluctant adventurer Monty in tow) find themselves on a cross-continent race against Rudolf and his minions (who are pursuing the diamonds) and the police (who want Templar and Monty for the murder of the courier). Along the way, the trio picks up a female crime reporter who takes part in the adventure in her quest for a career-making scoop on The Saint.

Whereas the previous book, The Holy Terror, takes place over the course of nearly a year, the events of Getaway take place over little more than 24 hours. The text indicates that this story takes place about two years after the events of The Last Hero. It is the first Saint story to take place completely outside of Great Britain since the novella "The Wonderful War" in Featuring the Saint.

Some editions of the novel (such as the Fiction Publishing Co. edition) omit a prologue that recaps the events of "The Melancholy Journey of Mr. Teal". According to this prologue (and later repeated within the main body of the text), the Saint has been "buccaneering" for 10 years by the time of this novel, during which time he had amassed a personal fortune of approximately 100,000 pounds, which was finally topped up by his absconding with a villain's diamonds at the end of "Melancholy Journey".

Much of the book is told from Monty Hayward's point of view. According to The Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film and Television 1928-1992 by Burl Barer, the character was based upon Charteris' real-life editor, Monty Haydon.

Film adaptation.
 Main article - The Saint's Vacation;

In 1940, Getaway was adapted as a motion picture by RKO as part of its ongoing Saint series. Retitled The Saint's Vacation, the film was the first to star Hugh Sinclair as Simon Templar.

Among the changes made for the film adaptation is that Rudolf now works for Nazi Germany, and the character of Patricia Holm is absent.

The Chief Rabbinate of Israel is the supreme Jewish religious governing body in the state of Israel.  The Rabbinate is the halakhic authority for the state, and controls many aspects of life in the Jewish state.  Issues under the jurisdiction of the Chief Rabbinate include Jewish marriages, Jewish divorce, Jewish burrials, Kashrut and kosher certification, olim, supervision of Jewish holy sites, working with various mikvot and yeshivot, and overseeing Israeli religious courts.

There are always two active Chief Rabbis in Israel, an Ashkenazi and a Sephardi Rabbi.

List of Chief Rabbis.
Chief Rabbis have existed around the world for centuries.  In Israel, there were pre-independence Rabbis and official Israel Chief Rabbis.

Controversy.
There have been many problems brought forth by secular Israelis regarding the Chief Rabbinate's strict control over Jewish weddings, divorce procedings, conversions, and who counts as Jewish for the purposes of immigration.  The Rabbinate does not accept non-Orthodox Rabbis performing any of the above listed ceremonies or proceedings.  Because of this, many Israelis choose to marry abroad in nearby Cyprus or another location.

The U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense is one of twelve subcommittees of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations. Military defense spending is the largest individual component of federal discretionary spending, making the Defense Subcommittee one of the more powerful Appropriations subcommittees.  When referring to federal discretionary spending as a whole, many budget analysists make a distinction between defense and non-defense discretionary spending.

Jurisdiction.
Funding requirements for the United States military are laid out in the U.S Constitution.  In addition to the general requirement that funds withdrawn from the Treasury only through "approprations made by law" (Article I, Section 9), the Constitution gives Congress the authority to "raise and support Armies," but limits funding for the military to a maximum of two years (Article I, Section 8). This restriction is generally not an issue for Congress, since by law, the federal budget operates on a year-to-year basis.

The subcommittee oversees overall funding for the Department of Defense, including the Army, Navy, Air Force. The subcommittee is also responsible for funding for the Central Intelligence Agency.

Some defense agencies are the responsibility of separate subcommittees.  Funding for military construction activities, such as military personnel housing and infrastructure, and veterans issues are handled by the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.  Funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is handled by the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.

Members, 110th Congress.
The Committee is currently chaired by Democrat Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, and the Ranking Minority member is Republican Ted Stevens of Alaska.

<doc id="3011814" title="Alickadoo" nonfiltered="1271" processed="1254" dbindex="1481283">




An alickadoo is a non-playing member of a UK based rugby union club who helps in the running of the club by performing various roles, usually on match days. These roles are not committee positions but are essential if the club is to function properly.

The term alickadoo is peculiar to rugby union in the UK and its origins are somewhat obscure. Legend attributes the term to former Irish fullback and captain Ernie Crawford, who was rumored to remark on a book read by a team-mate by saying "You and your bloody Ali Khadu." Another possible origin dates from the amateur days of the game, when hard pressed club helpers, when asked for more balls, players, games etc the reply was " it's all I can do". Hence alickadoo.

Similar terms include blazers and old farts (a reference to an outburst by Will Carling).

<doc id="7467064" title="Sahaj Marg Philosophy" nonfiltered="1273" processed="1256" dbindex="1481285">
This is an article on the philosophy of Sahaj Marg. An article on the practise of Sahaj Marg can be found here

The Sahaj Marg (or "Natural Path") system of meditation is advocated by several teachers, notably Chariji - the current president and spiritual head of the Shri Ram Chandra Mission,  headquartered in Chennai, India. Adherents claim that the practise is a modified form of traditional Raja Yoga, and that its philosophy draws on many sources, primarily Sufism, Hinduism, and Yoga. Kindly note that none of the practices of Sahaj Marg can be traced to the teachings of Patanjali, as claimed. (Refer to complete works of Vivekanada and his speach on teachings of Patanjali, Vol-1 Raja Yoga Chapter-2).  On the philosophy of Sahaj Marg, in a speech on New Year's Day, 2005 at Babuji Memorial Ashram, Manapakkam, India, according to Chariji, there is no room for philosophy in speeches of Sahaj Marg. In fact, he stated, "Sahaj Marg has no philosophy. It does not rest on any philosophy. It is neither advaita nor dvaita nor vishishta advaita." (From Speech by Shri Parthasarathi Rajagopalachari -Jan 1, 2005 at Babuji Memorial Ashram, Manapakkam, India- see references).  The teachings of the Masters then represent the philosophy of Sahaj Marg.

 The Goal .

The stated goal of the Sahaj Marg (or "Natural Path") system of meditation is "complete oneness with God, or the Ultimate." At SRCMtm God is allegedly present in form of Master and its adherents are expected to become one with the Master who, they claim, is of divine essence and is considered to be divine. (Current Master is Chariji who is a retired mill manager)

 The Brighter World .

Also referred to as Brahmaloka. (see discussion page) This is the concept of a higher plane of existence upon which liberated souls reside. Lalaji, Babuji, Swami Vivekananda, the Buddha and Jesus Christ reside there, among others, according to Sahaj Marg literature.

As per ancient Hindu belief there are many "loka" (places where there is life in any form) like Patalloka GandharvLoka and Bramhaloka, The concept of heaven is simply joy's of this world minus its miseries, Since Hindu s have understood this fact, that there cannot be joy without misery, hence the concept of heaven was proposed which is present in all religions of this world. 

Brahmaloka is allegedly a place where there is no separate identity of any being, this is supposed to be the place where there is only one soul which is present in the form of lord Vishnu. This concept of SRCM is hypothetical in nature and is generally misleading, i.e. that in Brahmaloka any individual soul can reside in the form they were present on this earth. This concept itself deviates from the original view of Brahmaloka according to Hindu philosophy, and which can be used to manipulate the public. (For reference kindly see Complete Works of Swami Vivekanda Vol-2 Chapter- Cosmos)...(See discussion page for further research sites on Brahmaloka)

 Samskaras .

These are the grossness of attachment, desire, and fear, which separate human beings from their divine nature. They are seen to be the root cause of all experiences, including both suffering and joy. Fundamental to the philosophy of Sahaj Marg is the concept of cleaning, whereby samskaras are removed, facilitating spiritual progress.

This concept which is used in SRCMtm is the most misleading and this is what causes its adherents to become, according to some, more and more ignorant and negligent of their family and societal responsibilities. If we try and understand the premise, the theory of karma, we will come to the conclusion that it is not possible for one not to pay for his/her deeds, this is the basic law of nature (action and reaction) and this is what is explained in detail in Karma Yoga, according to Karma Yoga, all good deeds will bring results in the form of bliss and joy and all bad deeds will return in the form of pain. And, the theory goes, no-one can save him/herself from the effects of their karma. According to this concept if a person has done some good and though living isolated in a forest, he/she will experience pleasure, and if a person has done bad, he will undergo pain, there is no escaping from this law, if a person causes pain to anyone it will ultimately come back, all actions, thoughts deeds and view s ultimately return back to the originator, this is the law of nature, and no-one can remain unaffected by his/her actions. (Ref:- Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda Vol-1 Karma Yoga )

In case of  SRCM we find that it is claimed that the effects of one s deeds can be erased, which is in contradiction to the law of Karma, whereas all the enlightened personalities of the past like Swami Vivekananda Gautama Buddha, Lord Krishan have all said that one cannot escape from one's deeds. (see References)

Teachings from the Sahaj Marg material.

Its adherents see it as a natural, simple heart-based approach to realizing the presence of the divine within their lives. The Shri Ram Chandra Mission is the main proponent of the Sahaj Marg system. 

Sahaj Marg is a remodeled and modified version of Raja Yoga (yoga of the mind) simplified to suit and help the man of present-day world to achieve the same inner perfection as the Master, which according to Sahah Marg is a synonym for God Realization.  It is a non-renunciate form of Raja Yoga, the 'renunciation' (renouncing the material world) of Raja Yoga having been replaced by 'detachment' (detachment from the material world) and attachment to the Divine.  Adherents will note that the "austerities" (tapas) and the Yamas with regards to the "non-receiving of any gifts" as described by Swami Vivekananda are not part of Sahaj Marg. (Complete works of Swami Vivekananda-see references) 

The Mind is the key instrument in a human being and by proper regulation of mind through meditation under practical guidance and support of a spiritual Master, who erases one's samskaras (imprints on the soul by our past thoughts or actions), one can evolve to the highest that the Master has attained.  The Master transmits to the disciple directly or through a preceptor that the disciple sees once a week in a private sitting.  There is also one or two group sittings and reading of Master's material every week. There is a suggested daily practice which involves a daily meditation, a daily cleansing, a weekly private sitting with a preceptor, and one or two group sittings per week.  There are gatherings on the birthdays of the Masters.  Some abhyasis organize discussions of the guru's writings. Reading of the Master's writings is suggested. Vegetarianism is encouraged. 

Sahaj Marg claims to be a non-monastic movement. Those who adhere to the practices are referred to as 'abhyasis'; a preceptor is an abhyasi who has been prepared and permitted by the Master to introduce people to the Sahaj Marg system and conduct group meditation.  Sahaj Marg  says that adherents of all religions are welcome, and do not have to reject their religion to practice Sahaj Marg. 

The practice of Sahaj Marg is free of charge and there are three meditations together with a trained preceptor for the starting of the practice.

There are no physical impedments to leaving the practice.

 On other religions .

On other religions- Sahaj Marg claims to "erase Samskaras" (imprint on the soul). The current Master, Chariji, stated that abhyasis were lucky. If they were in religion, he said, they would have to go to church and "you know", tell lies in that "wonderful place called the confessional".  Lord, forgive me for what I have done this week.  And there would be an equally sinful priest on the other side of the curtain saying,  In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I absolve you of your sins.  Something that according to Chariji, he has no power to do. No man on earth has power, he states, to absolve you of your sins except two people: one, oneself, and the other, God. In between there is nobody who can do it, he stated. Then he added, that is why religion is useless, that is why religion has failed. That s why, the Master stated, the abhyasis are all there, not in church. (Speech, (Reverence, Respect & Restraint), Denmark, Nov. 2005, see references)

...and later:

Chariji stated that he was no Christ, ("you know"), to crucify himself on the cross for all of them. Did they think Christ was a wise man, he asked, that he (Christ) became crucified so that forever and ever after humanity would be absolved of its sins? "I don t think so",  he said. It gave people more license for indulgence. But after all, he said, they have been forgiven two thousand years ago for what they are going to do today, what their children were going to do ten years hence.  He said that he did not think he (Christ) was wise. According to Chariji, he (Christ)left no room, no incentive for human beings to change, become moral, become spiritual. He said that they were all happy that they had a Christ who got crucified.  He added that none of us weep for Christ and that we were happy.  God bless him,  we say, which is another blasphemy. He then said that the abhyasis need blessings, not Christ. (Speech, (Reverence, Respect & Restraint), Denmark, Nov. 2005, see references)

At a preceptors' seminar in January, 2001, Chariji stated:

"In the Indian scene, the Hindus and Hinduism is corrupt. God is personified as somebody who can be bribed with gifts, with so called prasads - offering temptation of Heaven which fact Babuji emphasized in His teachings, saying that religions depends on two instruments - temptation and fear."

"I am afraid that Sahaj Marg is suffering in this way because even when Christian people become
abhyasis and preceptors, they somehow, somewhere along the way seem to lose this idea of love,
charity, compassion, faith and become preceptors. So what Spirituality offers and can deliver, our
priesthood, I would categorize you as, say temporarily as priesthood - they destroy." (Speech, Preceptor's Seminar, Jan. 2001-See references)

Written in the Sahaj Marg material: Abhyasi's question:"..... "Why do I have to give up my existing religious practices....."

Master's answer: "All religious practice involve the worship of God as being outside us. It is called Bahya Upachara in Sanskrit. Spirituality puts God where HE really is - inside the human heart, and indeed at the heart of every created thing, as Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita. One cannot mix the two. In the Vedas Murthy Pooja is called the lowest form of worship. Mantra is only a way of pleasing the mind, and bhajans please the senses, while giving the illusion of being a form of worship. I trust that this will be satisfactory. If people have more questions, they should be encouraged to read the Gita slowly, and try to understand it. Love to all." (Sahaj Sandesh No.: 2005.31- See references)

According to the teaching of this system, God is simple, and therefore, the way to reach Him must be simple. On the Nature of the Divine, when asked why in all the written material, God was referred to as "Him", Chariji replied: "God is Male, Nature is female." (SMRTI-Youth Services-Story Telling-See references)

 On chosing a master .

On choosing a guru, Chariji in his book: Heart of the Lion, states:

"....So I repeat, the Guru is the only friend.  In fact, I have said this so often, that in the Sufi philosophy, the Guru is called Friend.  "The Friend is coming".  Because he is the only fellow who can give his life for you.  He is the only fellow, therefore, to whom you must hand over totally, a Power of Attorney....."Do with me as you think I deserve to be done with.  Kick me when I have to be kicked.  Beat me when I have to be beaten.  Curse me when I have to be cursed.  But make of me what you think I should be eventually, because only you can do it."

"So once more I say this in all humility....if you must have a Master, find a fellow who is capable of, you know, throwing you around, beating you up, cutting you to pieces.  Remember Parushurama's father and the stern test that young boy had to make for obedience...."Kill your Mother". "Yes"..."

"He pulled out the sword and cut off her head.  He said, "I am pleased with you my son.  Ask for anything you want."  He said, "I want my mother alive."  And He said, "So be it."  and she got up and walked off.  The Guru is the Master, when you say of destiny, it means life and death.  He must be the Master of your life as he must be the Master of your death." (From Heart of the Lion, Shri Parthasarathi Rajagopalachari-see references)

 On freedom .

On freedom, in Salient Points of Sahaj Marg, it states that with Sahaj Marg, abhyasis have voluntarily, whole-heartedly and devotedly surrendered it to the Master of their Soul.  To those who are fortunate enough to arrive at this stage, the Master is apparently no longer a guide for spirituality alone.  He has now become the Master of the abhyasis' life in all it's aspects of existence.  He apparently has become the father, the mother, the son, the teacher, the doctor, in fact, there is no role that He does not play in the abhyasi's life.  He has taken total charge of the abhyasi.  It further states that only the surrendering to Him can bring about a state where He can take total charge of the abhyasis! (From Salient Features of Sahaj Marg - Series 2- Page 26 See references)

 On homosexuality .

On homosexuality, the Master of this system in a recent speech said that unlike the churches of the world, Sahaj Marg does not perform same-sex marriages. "That is unnatural", he said. God did not intend it to be thus, he added.  He then said it was a personal comment.  But there are things credited to Babuji Maharaj  If God did not want two sexes, he could have as well created one and seen that the world propagated by itself."...Why two sexes? he questioned.  Apparently not so that one sex should marry among themselves, according to Sahaj Marg Masters.  "So, what the church may allow, I don t have to condone or accept", he said, not mentionning what churches condones or performs same-sex marriages. "To me", Chariji said, "it is a very blatant misuse of so-called privileges of the human being, fundamental rights, et cetera. Of course, if you claim it is your fundamental right to go the dogs, so be it! Even God cannot stop it.
Speech by Chariji "Balance-The Crux of Life" Jan 20, 2006 in Malaysia

Some claim it is a fact (unsubstantiated) that there are followers, both abhyasis and preceptors who are homosexual. 
There are other claims that gay families have been broken up or have left. (see testimonial on discussion page) 

 On philosophy .

On the philosophy of Sahaj Marg, in a speech on New Year's Day, 2005
at Babuji Memorial Ashram, Manapakkam, India, according to Chariji, there is no room for philosophy in speeches of Sahaj Marg. In fact, he stated, "Sahaj Marg has no philosophy. It does not rest on any philosophy. It is neither advaita nor dvaita nor vishishta advaita." (From Speech by Shri Parthasarathi Rajagopalachari -Jan 1, 2005 at Babuji Memorial Ashram, Manapakkam, India- see references)

 Be like lions .

Be like lions: Sahaj Marg wants the abhyasis to be like lions:

The abhyasi is asked to look within. Look to the Heart. Build your heart, they are told. Make it brave, make it strong, make it courageous. They are asked to be lions, as Babuji wanted, he exhorts. He said: "One lion is worth more that five hundred sheep." It is not that we do not accept sheep but we accept sheep who are willing to become lions, not sheep who want to stay on as sheep.......And what was but a shepherd's pen has now become the jungle in which the lions roam freely. This is what Sahaj Marg is setting out to achieve, according to Babuji.
".....He wanted our hearts to be like lions - brave, courageous, capable of discrimination, able to give up everything for the sake of the Master." (From Salient Points of Sahaj Marg, Series 2-Page 21 see references)

 On idolatry .

On idolatry, the Sahaj Marg material states:

"Sahaj Marg has nowhere said temple worship is wrong, nor does Master expressly forbid idol worship"  ....To abhyasis, the preceptor, apparently, becomes such an idol.  The author states: "I believe that any abhyasi who says, "my preceptor" when talking about the preceptor who is serving him has fallen into this form of idol worship."  I seems there is concern that the preceptor can be transformed into an idol, or idolised.  The author follows: "Here again the Master may be in the background, but is that Master's rightful place?" 

"So Master's message is quite clear.  All credit goes to our Master.  When we give credit where it is not due, that too is a form of idol worship.  We should beware of falling into such errors......." ("Salient Features of Sahaj Marg" (SMRI Series 3) Page 52-53 see references)

 On donations .

On donations, the abhyasis is to think that it is their Mission, it is their Master, it is His plant, therefore, it is theirs, then, apparently, there is no sacrifice, there is no giving. The abhyasis are only watering their own plant. Who should they credit for it, is the question asked by the Master.

To think that the Master depends on the abhyasis' donation could very possibly be a sin, according to the Master. Masters exist in a dimension where money does not play a part. Whenever the Master makes the abhyasis donate something, he apparently does so as to lighten their burdens. Their contribution to the Master's work is apparently of the same proportion as the squirrel's contribution to Lord Rama's work. (from Salient Points of Sahaj Marg Series 3- Page 25 See references)

 On democracy .

On democracy, the current Master, Chariji stated that until there are no walls, one cannot say, "We're a free people," because, according to Chariji, we are only selecting the people we will accept. According to him, democracy is like a club, a select club, a rich man's club, a club of power. According to Chariji, because any organisation, including a democracy, has the power of accepting or rejecting, we can't say it is a free organisation? "Yes or no?" he asked.  "No", he replied.

Chariji claimed that Sahaj Marg has no such restriction. Everybody, from anywhere in the world is welcome. According to Chariji, everybody can come, everybody can go. Apparently, there are no restrictions. There are no fees. There are no restriction of education. "Is it a free organisation?", he asked.  "Is it human? Is it the real democracy of a free people, for a free people, by a free people? Yes or no?"  (Audience: "Yes.")"

Then Chari stated: "So Sahaj Marg is today, in my opinion, the only organisation in this world fulfilling the requirements of this definition of "Liberté, egalité, fraternité" equality, fraternity. Vive le Sahaj Marg! live Sahaj Marg! (applause)." (from Shri P. Rajagopalachari at Cossonay, Switzerland on July 13, 2003-see references)

Ben Lummis, (born Benjamin Lummis on June 1 1978), was the winner in season one of NZ Idol in 2004.
 
On May 10 Ben won New Zealand Idol, despite being in the bottom 3 multiple times. After winning NZ idol he released his first hit single 'They Can't Take That Away', which debuted in the NZ Top 40 Chart at #1 where it remained for seven weeks, selling over 4x platinum in the process. On June 15 saw the release of his debut album, One Road. Paul Ellis, later described the album as "the worst-sounding album of my entire career" .
One Road debuted at number one on the Top 40 Album Charts and stayed there for two weeks, making him the first ever local act to hold the top spot on the albums and singles chart simultaneously for more than a week. 

Music industry observers have commented that it is interesting how a performer can hold the top spot on the albums and singles chart simultaneously for more than a week and then be dumped by the record label less than three months later.

The album contains 12 tracks and includes contributions from songwriters who claim to know songwriters that have worked with Christina Aguilera, Jamelia, Atomic Kitten, Westlife, Britney Spears, and Kylie Minogue. Lummis co-wrote one of the tracks, O for awesome. Included on the album is also one of his standout performances from the New Zealand Idol programme, a cover of Spinal Tap's Sex Farm. The album was recorded in just eleven hours and Lummis sang all the back-up vocals himself.

Ben is of Tongan, Samoan, M ori (Ngati Porou) and P keh  descent and is close with his mother, father, stepfather and five siblings.  He is also a devout Christian and belongs to the Breakthrough Church.

Three months after winning New Zealand Idol, Lummis' music label, Sony BMG dropped him, due to poor sales.  Ironically, his runner-up, Michael Murphy gained a contract and is still going strong with his band Fivestar fallout.

It is rumoured that Ben is currently working on a new album and has been performing a single from that at major public events, such as the teddybear's picnic, and during the puppet show at the Foodtown in Onehunga.

Nyala Pema Dündul (1816-1872), also known as Terton Nyala Pema Duddul, was a teacher of Dzogchen and Tantric Buddhism in East Tibet.

In particular, he discovered and practiced the terma of the long-life practice of Guru Amitayus, called the Union of Primordial Essences.

Most sources state that the teacher in 1872 attained rainbow body.
According to one source, he on purpose did not, but reduced the left dead body in size and transformed it so that it would not decompose. According to the source the small body is now hidden at a secret location.

Many of his students attained rainbow body (e.g. Ayu Khandro and Nyala Rinpoche Rigdzin Changchub Dorje).

Bonnet Bay is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Bonnet Bay is located 29km south of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. The postcode is 2226.

Bonnet Bay is located on the Woronora River, which flows north into the Georges River. 

Landmarks.
Burnum Burnum Reserve lies between Bonnet Bay, Como, Jannali, Sutherland and Woronora. It extends for about two kilometres. The reserve effectively surrounds Bonnet Bay, with the only two roads leading into the suburb, cutting through it. Burnum Burnum Reserve hosts some plants that are almost extinct and are protected. However, it also represents a constant fire threat to Bonnet Bay, most notably manifesting in the 1994 Como bushfires. The reserve was originally known as "Jannali Reserve" but the name was changed in 2005 to commemorate Burnum Burnum, the prominent aboriginal Sutherland Shire resident. A small plaque details his famous speech in England at Australia's bicentenary in 1988. 

A noteworthy feature of this suburb is that most of the streets are named after American Presidents. Washington Drive snakes its way through the length of the suburb. Bonnet Bay is mostly residential, with a small shopping centre located in Kennedy Crescent.

Recreation.
Bonnet Bay has a boat ramp, a number of picnic and recreational areas, including a cricket oval, soccer oval, two netball courts and two baseball fields.

Events.
Bonnet Bay is well-known in southern Sydney for its extensive displays of Christmas decorations and lights during the festive season. Eisenhower Drive was at one point known as the focal point of the light show, but due to it being a cul-de-sac, local authorities have requested residents to limit their displays in this street.

<doc id="3215234" title="Wario: Master of Disguise" nonfiltered="1278" processed="1261" dbindex="1481290">



Wario: Master of Disguise  (           ; Kaitou Wario the Seven) is an upcoming platforming video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It is the fifth game in the Wario Land series. The game was released on January 18 2007 in Japan, and is set to be released on March 5th in   North America. The game's Japanese title refers to the fact that he has seven "forms" (other than his normal "Thief" form).

Gameplay.
The player manuevers Wario with either the directional-pad or the A, B, X and Y buttons. All other actions will be controlled by the touch-screen. To advance through levels, the player will be required to take advantage of various different forms of Wario.

Like its predecessor, Wario Land 4, Wario: Master of Disguise will feature health as opposed to invulnerability.

Forms.
Currently, all eight different forms into which Wario can transform have been confirmed:

Thief Wario: Faster jumping and running. Attacks directly. (To use, draw a tick);
Cosmic Wario: Jumps with longer hang time, as if in low-gravity. Attacks with lasers. (To use, draw a circle, starting from the bottom and going in clockwise direction);

Metro Pantitlán is a  station on the Mexico City Metro, Mexico. It is  located in the Iztacalco borough, to the east of downtown Mexico City city centre.

The station logo is the silhouette of two flags; this is because Pantitlán means "land of flags" in the Aztec language Nahuatl. 

Pantitlán station is the most important transfer station on the Mexico City Metro. 
It is the terminal for Lines 1, 5, 9 and A and has the highest user-traffic of the whole metro system. It is also one of the largest stations in the world, connecting four Metro lines, a trolley line, and around a hundred bus lines. Because of its large size and improvised design, it is important to follow the signs to the different platforms.
The link with Line A allows Mexico State (Estado de México) inhabitants to travel to Mexico City faster and cheaper than by bus or other kinds of transportation. 

Some curiosities are that all "numbered" Metro lines, and Line B, use pneumatic traction and gather electricity from a third rail; trains on Line A use traditional rail traction, and gather electricity with a pantograph. In addition, scenes for the 1990 motion picture Total Recall were filmed in the corridors and platforms of Metro Pantitlán.

Thomson is a lunar crater that is located within the Mare Ingenii on the far side of the Moon. Just to the northeast is the unusual merged crater formation of Van de Graaff. On the northwest rim of the mare is O'Day crater, and to the south-southwest is Obruchev crater on the southern shore of Mare Ingenii.

In the past the crater was flooded by lava, leaving only the outer rim intact. There are gaps in the eastern and western rims, leaving two "half-moon" mountainous formations facing each other across the relatively flat floor. There is a similar lava-flooded crater remnant attached to the southern rim of Thomson. The floor of Thomson has a number of secondary impacts that form short, linear streaks across the surface.

Satellite craters.
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Thomson crater.

<doc id="3208786" title="Naihanchi" nonfiltered="1285" processed="1268" dbindex="1481298">

Naihanchi (or Naifanchi) is a karate kata, performed in straddle stance (naihanchi-dachi / kiba-dachi ). It translates to 'internal divided conflict'. The form makes use of in-fighting techniques (i.e. tai sabaki (body evasion)) and grappling. There are three modern kata in this series (Shodan, Nidan and Sandan). Some researchers believe Nidan and Sandan were created by Anko Itosu, but others believe that it was originally one kata broken into three separate parts (probably due to constraints of space). The fact that only Tekki Shodan has a formal opening suggests the kata was split.

It has been suggested the kata was originally developed when fighting against a wall / ledge / narrow confined space which is unlikely; however it could be used for this purpose. Whilst the kata is linear, moving side to side, the techniques can be applied against attackers at any angle. The side to side movements in a low stance build up the necessary balance and strength for fast footwork and body shifting. Some researchers believe the form is a non-ballistic two-man grappling exercise.

Itosu is reported to have learnt the kata from Sokon Matsumura, who learnt it from a Chinese man living in Tomari. Itosu is thought to have changed the original kata. The form is so important to old style karate that Kentsu Yabu (a student of Itosu) often told his students  Karate begins and ends with Naihanchi  and admonished his students must practice the kata 10,000 times to make it their own. Before Itosu created the Pinan / Heian kata s, Naihanchi would traditionally be taught first in Tomari-te and Shuri-te schools, which indicates its importance. Gichin Funakoshi learnt the kata from Anko Asato. Funakoshi renamed the kata Tekki (Iron Horse) in reference to his old teacher, Itosu, and the forms power.

The oldest known reference to Naihanchi are in the books of Motobu Choki. He states the kata was imported from China, but is no longer practiced there. Motobu learnt the kata from Sokon Matsumura, Sakuma Pechin, Itosu Anko and Kosaku Matsumura.Motobu taught his own interpretation of Naihanchi, which included ti (Okinawan form of martial arts which predates karate) like grappling and throwing techniques. 

In the 1960 s a kung fu practitioner, Daichi Kaneko, studied a form of Taiwanese White Crane Boxing, known as Dan Qiu Ban Bai He Quan (Half Hillock, Half White Crane Boxing). Kaneko, an acupuncturist who lived in Yonabaru, Okinawa, taught a form called Neixi (inside knee) in Mandarin. This form includes the same sweeping action found in the nami-gaeshi (returning wave) technique of Naihanchi. Neixi is pronounced Nohanchi in Fuzhou dialect, which could indicate Neixi is the forerunner to Naihanchi.

Derek Hatton (born 17 January 1948 in Liverpool) is a broadcaster, businessman and after-dinner speaker. He won celebrity as a local politician in Liverpool, England, during the 1980s.

He attended Liverpool Institute for Boys, 1959 to 1964, having passed the 11 plus exam. His academic success was limited, but he enjoyed sports & appeared on stage as Gratiano in the school play, 'Merchant of Venice' alongside Bill Kenwright.

Hatton was a member of the Labour Party and became the high-profile deputy leader of Liverpool City Council in 1983. Hatton in fact was the most powerful member; the Leader of the council, John Hamilton, was a non-Militant member chosen as a figurehead. Hatton was expelled in 1986 for belonging to the Militant Tendency, an entryist faction in the Labour Party promoting Trotskyism. The National Executive Committee of the party voted to expel him by 12 votes to 6, the move being a policy aim of Neil Kinnock.   Hatton claims that the faults and disasters of his time in office were the result of the policy of the Thatcher government, and that he did his best to control the damage.  

After his expulsion from the party, Hatton pursued a career in the media, presenting a show on radio station Talk Sport, and appearing on such television programmes as Have I Got News For You, where he was given a particularly rough ride by regular panellist Paul Merton, who mocked his apparent aspiraton to be a comedian. Hatton even began modelling menswear; he had worked in a mens' tailoring shop as a teenager, and was famous during his time as a politician for his well-tailored suits. 

Hatton presented the lunchtime phone-in on 105.4 Century FM when it launched in 1998, titled "The Degsy Debate".  The BBC2 fly-on-the-wall documentary Trouble at the Top followed the station's launch, and Hatton's training.

Hatton claimed that he was the inspiration for the character of Michael Murray (Robert Lindsay) in the acclaimed Alan Bleasdale television drama G.B.H., broadcast by Channel 4 in 1991.  In the 1990s, he worked as Talk Radio's morning phone-in presenter . In 1996, he was the subject of a BBC documentary, My Brilliant Career. 

Derek Hatton now works as a motivational speaker  and is Chairman of the new media company Rippleffect. His son Ben Hatton is its managing director.

Senegal is a coastal West African nation located 14 degrees north of the Equator and 14 degrees west of the Prime Meridian. The country's total area is 196,190 km,² of which 192,000 km² is land and 4,190 km² is water, making the nation slightly smaller than Britain or the U.S. state of South Dakota.

Senegal is bordered to the west by the North Atlantic Ocean. On land, the nation's largest border is Mauritania to the north, an 813 km border along the Senegal River. To the east is the 419 km border with Mali. In the southeast is Guinea (330 km border) and to the south-southwest is Guinea-Bissau (338 km), both borders running along the Casamance River. Senegal is one of only a handful of countries to have a near-enclave within its borders the small nation of The Gambia in the interior, which has a 740 km border with Senegal. The Gambia penetrates more than 320 km into Senegal, from the Atlantic coast to the center of Senegal along the Gambia River, which bisects Senegal's territory. In total, Senegal has 2,640 km of land borders, and 531km of coastline and shoreline. Senegal makes maritime claims of a 44 km (24 nautical mile) contiguous zone, a 22 km (12 nautical mile) territorial sea, and a 370 km (200 nautical mile) exclusive economic zone. It also claims a 370 km (200 nautical mile) continental shelf, or to the edge of the continental margin.

Well-defined dry and humid seasons result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds. Dakar's annual rainfall of about 610 mm (24 in) occurs between June and October when maximum temperatures average 27 °C (82 °F); December to February minimum temperatures are about 17 °C (63 °F). Interior temperatures are higher than along the coast, and rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding 1.5 m (60 in) annually in some areas.

The lowest point in Senegal is the Atlantic Ocean, at sea level. The highest point is an unnamed feature near Nepen Diakha in the Fouta Djallon foothills at 581 m (1900 ft).



Climate:
tropical; hot, humid; rainy season (May to November) has strong southeast winds; dry season (December to April) dominated by hot, dry, harmattan wind

Vegetation:



Senegal has 6 vegetation zones: sahel, Sahel-Soudan, Soudan, Soudan-Guinea, tropical rainforest, and mangrove.
The following chart gives an idea of this, but the zones are not labeled as above (aldough these are the official vegegatation names):

The Battle of Monte Pelato ("Bald Mountain") was an engagement of the Spanish Civil War fought on 28 August, 1936. It was notable as the first major engagement of the Italian anti-fascist volunteers of the Matteotti Battalion. 

Monte Pelato, in Aragon, between Huesca and Almudévar, was the site of a fascist gun emplacement and a concentration of around five hundred fascist troops.  In bitter fighting from five until nine in the morning, Italians and the Spanish Anarchists of the Francisco Ascaso Column seized the enemy position while suffering heavy losses.

Amongst those Italian volunteers killed were republican Mario Angeloni, commander of the Column, the anarchist Michele Centrone, the "giellista" Giuseppe Zuddas, the  anarchist Fosco Falaschi, the Communist Attilio Papparotto and the anarchist Vincenzo Perrone. 

Among those Italians who survived, were socialist Carlo Rosselli, anarchists Camillo Berneri, Maria Zazzi, and Leonida Mastrodicasa.

Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari (1918-1998)

A Brief Introduction by Bakhtyar Haider Pirzada al-Azhari

 If the flame of knowledge burns out then human contemplation is incarcerated by superstitions and nonsense. 
- Ziya  al-Ummat, Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari.

His life.

 Readers! This was the luminous candle in the spiritual chain of the Chishti Shuyukh ; the intrinsic heir to the knowledge and spiritual treasures of Baha  al-Haqq Zakariyya Multani ; the justice of the most powerful court  in Pakistan; the symbol of the yearning of the Islamic community; the possessor of vision in the flower garden of Iqbal ; the central pioneer in the renaissance of the great educational and thoughtful movement of Dar al- Ulum al-Muhammadiyya al-Ghawthiyya; the founder and chief of the Ziya i Haram Monthly magazine in the world of journalism; the author of the unique and extraordinary exegesis of the modern era, Tafsir Ziya  al-Qur an; the one who drowned in the ocean of love for the noble Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and then profoundly wrote his biography, Ziya  an-Nabi; the founder of the leading publishing house, Ziya  al-Qur an Publications; this was Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari who, during his student years, from morning till midday and from the afternoon prayer to the late afternoon prayer, used to spend his time acquiring the knowledge of Islam from his teachers. During the times in between, he used to seclude himself under the shade of the trees and used to spend this time acquiring the knowledge of the modern sciences of sociology, politics and English. 

Ziya  al-Ummat, Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari was born on 1st July 1918 (21st Ramadan 1336 AH) in the village of Bhera, District Sargodha, Pakistan and died on 7th April 1998 (9th Dhu l-Hijja 1418 AH) at Islamabad, Pakistan.

Shah in the Indian subcontinent refers to the tribe of Quraysh in the Arabian Peninsula. Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s lineage, on this basis, links him to this ancient Arabian tribe, which is the tribe of the Prophet of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad. Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s ancestry is traced back to Habbar ibn al-Aswad al-Qurashi, who accepted the religion of Islam, after the conquest of Makka, at the hands of Muhammad and thus became a Companion (Sahabi). Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s father is Shaykh Muhammad Shah, who was born in Bhera in the year 1890, and his mother s name is Kaniz Fatima, who is the daughter of Ghulam Muhyuddin Shah.

Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah began his education with the Qur an and its memorisation in his home village of Bhera. From 1925 to 1929 he was a pupil at Muhammadiyya Ghawthiyya Primary School. He completed matriculation in 1936 at the Government High School Bhera. During these early years, he was gaining the knowledge of Islamic disciplines and Qur anic teachings from his father. However, between 1936 and 1941 he formally and in much depth studied various Islamic sciences and disciplines with a number of different teachers and scholars. The subjects he studied included; tafsir (Qur anic exegesis), hadith (science of prophetic traditions), fiqh (religious jurisprudence), sarf (Arabic etymology), nahw (Arabic syntax), mantiq (logic), falsafa (philosophy), balagha (rhetoric), adab (literature), etc. and the Persian language.

In 1941, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah enrolled in the Oriental College Lahore for the Fadil  Arabi, which is equivalent to the modern day bachelor degree.  He passed this in first division with a score of 512/600 and took the first position in the entire province of Punjab.

After gaining an insight into various sciences, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah desired to complete a well-known intensive course called  Dawra-i Hadith . This involves a complete revision of the prophetic traditions that have been collected by various hadith scholars including the six Sihah and various other sources of hadith. He approached his Shaykh for guidance and upon his advice travelled to Muradabad in India to complete this course at the hands of a renowned Shaykh, Na im ad-Din al-Muradabadi. The Shaykh was a prominent figure and scholar, but more so he was the disciple and student of one of the greatest Sufi masters and leaders of the Indian subcontinent, Imam Ahmad Rada Khan al-Qadiri. In 1943, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah completed this course with much admiration from his honourable teacher.

Upon returning from Muradabad, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah continued to further his knowledge and thus enrolled in the University of the Punjab. In 1945, he completed his BA degree from the faculty of English Language. This was in a time when the British were in power and seeking anything that even remotely resembled the western way of life and language was deemed wrong by many. However, through his foresight and discernment, this revolutionary step proved crucial in the subsequent service to Islam.

The following years played an important role in Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s life. These were the years when the Pakistan movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah was at its peak. There were many groups with various affiliations rallying their cry during this time. On the one hand, both the Hindus and Muslims wanted independence from the British. Many Muslims   including Shaykh Muhammad Shah and his son, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah   desired a separate state for the Muslim population, as they did not wish to exchange British rule for a Hindu rule. This was the Pakistan movement championed by the Muslim League. There were other Muslims who did not support a two-state solution and they were known as the Unionist Party. During the years 1946-47, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah actively participated in the Pakistan movement along with his father. Shaykh Muhammad Shah   being a known figure and spiritual guide   travelled to many areas throughout Pakistan, accompanied by Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah, calling on every one and especially his disciples and followers to support the Muslim League. During all these testing times, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah stood side-by-side with his father. Following Pakistan s independence in 1947, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah began teaching at his father s institute at Bhera.

In 1951, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah travelled to Egypt and in September enrolled at the University of Al-Azhar.  The following year he also enrolled in the Cairo University. At the University of Al-Azhar, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah studied for his MPhil degree in the faculty of Law and Jurisprudence (department of Judiciary) and the title of his thesis was  al-Hudud fi l-Islam , which was supervised by Dr. Ayyub  Ali. At Cairo University, he studied Usul al-Fiqh (principles of Islamic jurisprudence) and Arabic Literature.  In 1954, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah returned to Pakistan after specialising in Judiciary at the University of Al-Azhar and in Arabic Literature at Cairo University. Whilst still studying at Al-Azhar, the Pakistani students established a society called al-Ittihad al-Thaqafi li Talabat al-Bakistan (cultural society of Pakistani students) and Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was elected as the Secretary of this Society from 1952-1953.

Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s teachers and mentors in Egypt included Professor Dr Muhammad Mustafa Shilbi, Dr Ahmad Zaki and the prominent Imam Muhammad Abu Zahra. Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was affected a great deal by these scholars as he enhanced and modernised the existing educational system and introduced necessary contemporary subjects at his institute such as English language, economics and political science.

As a child, Shaykh Muhammad Shah had Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah make the bay at (spiritual allegiance of complete obedience) to his Shaykh, Shaykh Ziya  ad-Din as-Siyalwi in the Chishti Nizami Sufi Order. Later on, the son of Shaykh Ziya  ad-Din, Khawaja Shaykh Qamar ad-Din as-Siyalwi became his khalifa (spiritual viceroy). Subsequently, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah renewed his bay at at the hands of Shaykh Qamar ad-Din as-Siyalwi, who then gave Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah permission to acquire the bay at of others as his khalifa (spiritual viceroy).
Upon the death of his father, in 1957, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah formally became the head of his father s institution  Dar al- Ulum al-Muhammadiyya al-Ghawthiyya (DMG) Bhera  . Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah modernised the system of this institution, its syllabus and structure. He refined it to such an extent that today he himself is considered to be the founder of the institution and 1957 is referred to as the year of the Nash a Thaniyya, the new beginning. 

When the majority of traditional scholars and Imams tend to avoid politics, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was very open and did not hesitate to show his support and express his critique: Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was involved in the Pakistan independence movement of 1947 led by Muhammad  Ali Jinnah; the  finality of prophethood  movement of 1974 (whose objective was to constitutionally recognise the Ahmadi/Qadiyani population as a non-Muslim minority in Pakistan and not to be included as Muslims); and the  Nizam Mustafa  movement of 1977 opposing the ideas of Socialism presented by the government of Zulfqar Ali Bhutto of the Pakistan s People Party. In 1970, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah began publishing the Ziya i Haram Monthly, which is primarily a journal of Islamic Studies that presents articles and essays related to academia. Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah regularly and with much passion used to write the editorial of this journal providing guidance to the common Muslim in relation to current affairs. This editorial was titled  Sirre Dilbaran  (the secret of the leaders). The editorial of this journal is headed with the same title even today.

Due to his views, on many occasions he was heavily criticised by various circles. When he included secular subjects in his curriculum, he was criticised by his contemporaries. When he stood up for fundamental Islamic viewpoints, he was criticised by politicians who wanted scholars to avoid this area and stay within their mosques. He wanted politicians to understand the values and principles of Islam and implement them in Pakistan. Moreover, he wanted Muslim scholars to realise the circumstances and challenges they face in the modern world. On a few occasions, he paid a price for his stance. Due to his strong opposition to Zulfqar Ali Bhutto s government, he was imprisoned for three months and his monthly journal was placed under the regulations of press censorship.

Following the events of 1977 and the  Nizam Mustafa  movement, General Zia-ul-Haq   Chief of the Pakistani Army   took over the presidency by a military coup and dismissed Bhutto s government. General Zia-ul-Haq seemed to desire the  Islamisation  of Pakistan. He found the present judicial system inadequate and thus in 1980 founded the Federal Shari a Court. Some of the decisions made by the judges in this court caused many outcries and criticisms. For example, when the Federal Shari a Court announced that the punishment for adultery   Rajm (stoning to death)   was not an Islamic legal punishment, this verdict was met with immense opposition from the Muslim scholars. It is no surprise that at the forefront of these critics was Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah, who severely criticised this decision in his monthly editorial.

Due to Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s scholarly ability and understanding manifested during this academic and theological debate, General Zia-ul-Haq approached him and offered him the membership of the Federal Shari a Court. Hence in June 1981, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah began his judicial career at the Federal Shari a Court.  Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah worked at this court for one year and three months. On 7th October 1982, he began serving in the Shari a Appellant Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah remained at this post till his death. In 1980 Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was awarded the  Star of Distinction  by General Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan.

In August 1988, upon the request of General Zia-ul-Haq, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah travelled to Geneva and defended the position of the government of Pakistan upon the issue raised by the Pakistani Qadiyanis at the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations.  The Qadiyanis filed a complaint to the Commission that their human rights were being violated in Pakistan.  After three days of continuous deliberations, thirteen out of fifteen judges at the Commission adjudicated in favour of Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah and declared that the rights of the Qadiyanis were in fact not being violated by the Pakistanis or the government of Pakistan.  This was a great victory for Islam as the followers of Ghulam Ahmed Qadiyani (who claimed to be a prophet) were declared non-Muslims at the UN Human Rights Commission as a result of Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s compelling, convincing and realistic arguments.

In 1990, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah founded the  al-Ghawthiyya Girls College  in Bhera to cater for the educational and Islamic needs of the Muslim sisters in that part of the world. Since 1990, over four hundred students have graduated from the college and at present there are over five hundred students at the college in Bhera, excluding its branches in other places.

On 6th March 1993, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was awarded the  Decoration of Honour  by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.

 
Eulogies from his contemporaries.

His Shaykh, Khawaja Qamar ad-Din as-Siyalwi:

 Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah is the light of my eyes. Moreover, he is like the tomb s minaret of our grand Shaykh of Siyal. 

His teacher from the subcontinent during his graduation ceremony at Muradabad, Sadr al-Afadil Shaykh Na im ad-Din al-Muradabadi:

 Today I am satisfied that the trust of knowledge and hadith, which I was endowed with has been passed on to the right person. 

His teacher from the Arab land on his departure from Cairo, Imam Abu Zahra:

 The moment I met you, I felt that you possessed great self-esteem, a valued character, and an inclination towards exalted objectives and a feeling of distance from futile pursuits. O my son! You have made me aware that, as the East is the place of the sun s rising, similarly it is the horizon of the rising of the spirit. As the East is the source of warmth, similarly it is the origin of the dawn of life. Each time I met you, I saw within you Islam luminous and resplendent as the sun and I saw such an Islam within you that is able to stitch together dispersed and broken hearts. I see within you the hope of a bright future.  Today as I am saying farewell to you, it seems as though a section of my soul is separating away from me, a part of my spirit is breaking away from me. 

Former President of Pakistan, Muhammad Rafiq Tarar:

 The death of Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah Al-Azhari was a severe blow to the whole Muslim Ummah. His contribution to Islamic Law will not be forgotten for a long time. He embodied true Islamic knowledge and understanding. Studying and teaching was second nature to him and his research and literary skills were of exemplary standards. 

Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif:

 Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari is not just the name of an individual, but the name of a universal movement and a unique personality. He was an outstanding scholar and an immaculate religious guide. When he departed from this world, our country lost a great commentator of the Qur an and a great religious thinker. He was a symbol of unity in a fragmented environment and he was the pride of the whole Islamic nation. He was a true devotee of the Prophet, a complete Wali, and a Shari a-adhering scholar. Individuals like him are seldom born. 

Senator  Abd as-Sattar Khan Niyazi:

 Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah's unique personality is a radiant lamp for not just the Pakistanis, but the entire Muslim Ummah. I have used the present tense intentionally because personalities such as him live on and give guidance to the people even after their death through their ideas, outstanding and sincere services to Islam, their love for the people and through their sacrifices in the path of Allah. After Imam Ahmad Rada Khan al-Qadiri, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah is the most outstanding scholar from the Indian Subcontinent. 

His heir, Shaykh Muhammad Amin al-Hasanat Shah al-Qurashi:

 From whichever angle I look towards him - as a father, as a teacher, as a spiritual guide, as a political leader, and as a judge - he was an exemplary person. The amazing thing was that there was no divide between his inner and outer self, and he treated his own children just like he dealt with everyone else.  

There is one story that I will never forget; when I was young and my father was studying in Egypt, I asked him for a car in a letter.  When he heard this he replied saying that don't ask for cars but pray to Allah asking for the love of the Prophet. It was natural for a child of my age to ask for such things, especially since he had been away for so long. But even in such circumstances he still said to his child to ask Allah for the love of His beloved; something after which a person yearns for nothing else. I have seen all aspects of his flawless character which is a source of guidance.

Ziya  al-Ummat: The Ummah s Luminary.

The name Ziya  (light, luminary) has become an appellation of Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari (ra). His initial Shaykh s name was Ziya  ad-Din as-Siyalwi. Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s literary masterpieces are also titled with this, such as, Ziya  al-Qur an, Ziya  an-Nabi and Ziya i Haram Monthly. When he was asked about the name of his exegesis in an interview, Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah replied:

I had a spiritual guide, Muhammad Qamar ad-Din, his father s name was Ziya  ad-Din. Firstly, this name that I use, Ziya , is an indication to him. Secondly, out of the many names I pondered over, this was my favourite. 

Astonishingly, it is a blessing and a sign of acceptance that today and during the latter part of his life Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah has become recognised as Ziya  al-Ummat, the light or luminary of the Islamic community. When Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah was asked in an interview in Egypt, after receiving the decoration from President Hosni Mubarak in 1993, whether he had been awarded with any other merits, he replied:

I was awarded the  Star of Distinction  in 1980. I have also been given the title Ziya  al-Ummat; a title I have been awarded with by the people of Pakistan. 

In the Muslim world, certain distinguished personalities are referred to with certain titles due to the excellences and beauties of their unique personalities. Such as, the appellation al-Ghawth al-A zam refers to Shaykh  Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani of Baghdad (d. 560 AH / 1165 CE) , Qutb al-Aqtab refers to Shaykh Bakhtiyar Kaki of India (d. 728 AH / 1328 CE) , A la Hadrat refers to Imam Ahmad Rada Khan al-Qadiri  and Sadr al-Afadil refers to Shaykh Na im ad-Din al-Muradabadi. 

Due to Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah s immense dedication and service to Islam, devotion and love for the Prophet Muhammad, sincerity and purity of intent, modest and humble nature, illumination of the hearts of people through his Ziya  al-Qur an and Ziya  an-Nabi, spirituality and love for prayer; no doubt, Justice Shaykh Muhammad Karam Shah al-Azhari is a personification of the truly reflective appellation of Ziya  al-Ummat. He is the Ummah s luminary.

<doc id="44768" title="Mont Blanc" nonfiltered="1302" processed="1285" dbindex="1481316">



Mont Blanc (French for white mountain) or Monte Bianco (Italian, same meaning) also known as "La Dame Blanche" (French, the white lady), in the Alps, (4,808 m / 15,774 ft) is the highest mountain in Western Europe.
 
The mountain lies between the regions of Aosta Valley, Italy and Haute-Savoie, France. The location of the summit itself is a subject of controversy between the two countries, and each tends to place it within its own boundaries on maps. In a convention between France and Kingdom of Sardinia, in Turin (1861), the border  was fixed on the highest point of Mont Blanc and this was the last official definition of this border, but often the French maps do not respect this solution.

The two most famous towns near Mont Blanc are Chamonix, in Haute-Savoie, France (site of the first Winter Olympics) and Courmayeur, in the Aosta Valley in Italy.
Begun in 1957 and completed in 1965, the 11.6 km (7  mi) Mont Blanc Tunnel runs beneath the mountain between these two cities and is one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes.

The Mont Blanc massif is popular for mountaineering, hiking, and skiing. 

 History .

 First ascents .


The first recorded ascent of Mont Blanc was on August 8, 1786 by Jacques Balmat and the doctor Michel Paccard. This climb, initiated by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, who gave a reward for the successful ascent, traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering. The first woman to reach the summit was Marie Paradis in 1808. United States president to-be Theodore Roosevelt also led an expedition, reaching the summit while on his honeymoon in 1886.

Now the summit is ascended by an average 20,000 mountaineer-tourists each year and could be considered an easy, yet long, ascent for someone who is well trained and used to the altitude. This impression is reinforced by the fact that from l'Aiguille du Midi (where the cable car stops), Mont Blanc seems quite close, being merely 1000 m higher.

However, every year the Mont Blanc massif takes many victims, and in peak weekends (normally around August) the local rescue service flies an average of 12 missions, mostly directed towards people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain. These are courses that require knowledge of high-altitude mountaineering, a guide (or at least a veteran mountaineer), and proper equipment. It is a long course that includes delicate passages and the hazard of rock slides. Also, at least one night at the refuge is required to get used to the altitude; less could lead to altitude sickness and possible death.

 Who owns the summit? .

Since the French Revolution this question has spurred many debates. Before this event, the whole mountain was in the Kingdom of Sardinia for several centuries.

The first treaty to define a border in the region is dated May 15, 1796. In this treaty the Sardinian king was forced by Napoleon to cede Savoie and Nice's  territories to the French Republic, and in article 4 of this treaty it says: "The border between the Sardinian kingdom and the departements of the French Republic will be established on a line determined by the most advanced points on the Piedmont side, of the summits, peaks of mountains and other locations subsequently mentioned, as well as the intermediary peaks, knowing: starting from the point where the borders of Faucigny, the Duchy of Aoust and the Valais, to the extremity of the glaciers or the Monts-Maudits: first the peaks or plateaus of the Alps, to the rising edge of the Col-Mayor". 
This act is even more confusing, because it states that the border should be visible from the town of Chamonix and Courmayeur. The summit is not visible from Courmayeur, because part of the mountain lower down obscures it. Already inaccurate at the time, this treaty is no longer valid, because it was replaced by a later legal act.

This act was signed in Turin on March 24, 1860 by Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and deals with the annexation of Savoie. A demarcation agreement, signed on March 7, 1861, defines the "new border".

One of the prints from the Sarde Atlas, made in 1823 and positions the border exactly on the summital edge of the mountain (and measures it to be 4,804 m high.

The convention of March 7, 1861 recognizes this, through an attached map, but takes into consideration the limits of the massif, and draws the border on the icecap of the Mont Blanc, and therefore makes it both French and Italian. Watershed analysis of modern topographic mapping not only places the main summit on the border, but also suggests that the border should follow a line northwards from the main summit towards Mont Maudit, leaving the south east ridge to Mont Blanc de Courmayeur wholly within Italy. 

Despite the fact that the Franco-Italian border was redefined in both 1947 and 1963, the commission, made up of both Italians and French, tactfully ignored the Mont Blanc issue.

The Vallot cabin.
The first real scientific investigations on the summit were conducted by the botanist-meteorologist Joseph Vallot at the end of the 19th century. He wanted to stay near the top of the summit, so he had to build his own permanent cabin.

The Janssen Observatory.
In 1891, Pierre Janssen, a scientific academic, envisaged the construction of an observatory at the summit of Mont Blanc. Gustave Eiffel agreed to take on the project, provided he could find strong foundations. The Swiss surveyor Imfeld dug down 15 m but found nothing solid, so Eiffel gave up.

Despite this, the observatory was built in 1893. Levers attached to the ice supported the observatory. This worked to some extent until 1906, when the building started leaning heavily. The movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly, but three years later (two years after Jannsen s death) a crevasse started opening under the observatory and it was abandoned. Eventually the building fell, and only the tower could be saved in extremis.

Air crashes.
The mountain was the scene of two fatal Air India air crashes, in 1950  and 1966.  Both planes were approaching Geneva airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent; 48 and 117 people lost their lives. 

 Altitude .


The summit of Mont Blanc is a thick, perennial ice and snow dome whose thickness varies, so no exact and permanent summit altitude can be determined. But accurate measurements have been made. 
For a long time its official altitude was 4,807 m. Then in 2002, the IGN and expert surveyors, with the aid of GPS technology, measured it to be 4,810.40 m.

After the 2003 heatwave in Europe, a team of scientists re-measured the height on the 6th and 7th of September. The team was made up of the glaciologist Luc Moreau, two surveyors from the GPS Company, three people from the IGN, seven expert surveyors, four mountain guides from Chamonix and Saint-Gervais and four students from various institutes in France. This team noted that the altitude was 4,808.45 m, and the peak was 75 cm away from where it had been in 2002.

After these results were published, more than 500 points were measured, to assess the effects of climate change, and the fluctuations in the height of the mountain at different points. From then on the altitude of the mountain has been measured every two years.

The interpretation that the heatwave had caused this fluctuation is disputed, because the heatwave is known not to have significantly affected the glaciers above 4000 m. The height and position of the summit could have been moved by general glacial forces. At this altitude, the temperatures rarely rise above 0°C. During the summer of 2003, the temperature did rise to 2°C, and even 3°C, but this would not have been enough for the ice, which stayed at -15°C, to melt.

The summit was measured again in 2005, and the results of were published on 16 December 2005. The height was found to be 4,808.75 m, 30 cm more than the previous recorded height.

The actual rock summit is at 4,792 m, and is 40 m away from the ice-covered summit.

 Climbing routes .

There are a few 'classic' climbing routes of Mont Blanc:

 The most popular route to climb Mont Blanc is The Voie des Cristalliers, also known as Voie Royale. Starting from Saint-Gervais the Tramway du Mont-Blanc (TMB) is taken to get to the Nid d'Aigle. The ascent then begins in the direction of the Tête Rouge cabin and then through the Goûter Corridor, considered very dangerous because of frequent rock-falls, leading to Goûter cabin for night shelter. The next day the route leads to the Dôme du Goûter, the Vallot cabin and L'arrête des Bosses.

 La Voie des 3 Monts is also known as La Traversée. Starting from Chamonix, the Téléphérique de l'Aiguille du Midi is taken towards the Col du Midi. The Cosmiques cabin is used to spend the night. The next day the ascent continues through Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit.

 The historic itinerary through the Grand Mulets, which is most frequently traversed in winter by skis or in summer to go down to Chamonix.

 The normal Italian itinerary is also known as La route des Aiguilles Grises. After crossing the Miage glacier, the night is spent at the Gonella cabin. The next day proceeds through the Col des Aiguilles Grises and then the Dôme du Goûter, concluding at L'arrête des Bosses.

 The Miage - Bionnassay - Mont Blanc crossing is usually done in three days. The route begins from Contamines-Montjoie, with the night spent in the Conscrits cabin. The following day, the Dômes de Miages is crossed and the night spent at the Durier cabin. The third day proceeds through l'Aiguille de Bionnassay and then the Dôme du Goûter.

From the summit of Mont Blanc on a clear day, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest and the Massif Central mountain ranges can be seen, as well as the principal summits of the Alps.

 Exploits .

 In 1886 Future US President Theodore Roosevelt led the third recorded expedition to the peak.
 In 1960, the airplane pilot Henri Giraud landed on the summit, which is only 30 m long.
 In 1990, the Swiss Pierre-André Gobet, leaving from Chamonix, completed the ascent and descent in 5 hours, 10 minutes and 14 seconds.
 On May 30, 2003, Stéphane Brosse and Pierre Gignoux try to beat the record by ski-walking. They went up in 4 hours and 7 minutes, and came back down in 1 hour and 8 minutes. In total they did the ascent and descent in 5 hours and 15 minutes.
 On August 13, 2003 seven French paragliders landed on the summit. They reached a peak altitude of 5,200 m, thanks to the hot weather conditions, which provided strong hot air currents. Five had left from Planpraz, one from Rochebrune at Megève and the last one from Samoëns.

 Protection of Mont Blanc .

The Mont Blanc massif is being put forward as a potential World Heritage Site because of its uniqueness and its cultural importance, considered the birthplace and symbol of modern mountaineering. However not everyone shares this goal and it would require the three governments of Italy, France and Switzerland to make a request to UNESCO for it to be listed.

Mont Blanc is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, and for this reason, it is threatened. Pro-Mont Blanc (an international collective of associations for the protection of Mont Blanc) published in 2002 the book Le versant noir du mont Blanc (The black hillside of Mont Blanc), which exposes current and future problems in conserving the site.

<doc id="1639289" title="Idiospermum" nonfiltered="1305" processed="1288" dbindex="1481319">


Idiospermum australiense, the sole species in the genus Idiospermum, is one of the most primitive flowering plants known, having lived in the Daintree Rainforest of Queensland, Australia for 120 million years. It is only found in very few locations of the Daintree Rainforest in the very wet lowland parts of the forest, where it grows in groups of 10-100 trees together (rather than scattered individuals). Common names include Ribbonwood and Idiot Fruit.

It is an evergreen tree, growing to 20-30 m tall. The leaves are produced singly, in pairs or in whorls of 3-4; the leaf is simple, 12-25 cm long and 5-9 cm broad. The flowers are 4-5 cm diameter, with spirally arranged red tepals. The fruit is a brittle globular nut-like seed around 8 cm in diameter, which splits into three or four segments once fallen; it is very toxic, with symptoms (in cattle) similar to strychnine.

Most plants have both male and female sex organs, but half of the flowers of the Ribbonwood do not obtain any female sex organs, the species using the process of cross-pollination. Attracted by the colour and smell of the flower, tiny beetles and thrips crawl in and lay their eggs within the center of the flower, which contains the flower's pollen. Within the flower some of the sticky pollen gets trapped on the insect's bodies, and if the next flower they visit is a receptive one, it will pollinate and produce the seeds.

While other modern flowering plants produce seeds which have one cotyledon (monocotyledons) or two (dicotyledons), the seedlings of the Ribbonwood have between three or four cotyledons. Also the Ribbonwood can produce more than one shoot per seed, while the seeds in all other plant species will develop and send up a single shoot.

The seeds are currently mainly spread through gravity dispersal, the seeds rolling down the steep mountain slopes to find their new home. The seeds are so toxic that most animals cannot eat them; however it is known that the native Musky Rat-kangaroo does disperse and bury some of these seeds. It has been suggested that the seeds were formerly dispersed by the now-extinct Diprotodon, on the basis that many Australian marsupials are adapted to cope with the toxins in Australian plants.

The plants have adapted also in the poison (chemical called Idiospermuline) that are contained within the seed, to prevent animals eating them. Researchers discovered the poison affects transmission of messages between individual nerve cells, which may cause seizures. In small doses this chemical can be used to save lives.

Discovery.
First found by timber cutters south of Cairns in the late 1800s, the Ribbonwood was then brought to the attention of the German botanist Ludwig Diels, who described the species in the genus Calycanthus as C. australiense in 1902, a remarkable disjunction for this otherwise North American genus. It was later believed to be extinct, because when Diels finally returned to the location where this tree was found, it was too late, the spot had been cleared for a sugar cane farm (one of the principal commercial crops of north Queensland). 

The species was rediscovered in 1971, after the poisonous seeds of the plant were found in the stomachs of dying cattle in the region. In 1972, the Australian botanist T. S. Blake reassigned it to the new family Idiospermaceae and the genus Idiospermum (idio-, "unusual", and spermum, "seed"). In its 2003 revision, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group retained it in the new genus, but restored the species to the family Calycanthaceae.

Philip Markus Petursson (born October 21, 1902 in Roseau, Minnesota, died May 12, 1988) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1966 to 1977, and briefly served as a cabinet minister in the government of Edward Schreyer.

Petursson was educated at the University of Manitoba, the University of Chicago, the Meadville Theological School. He was an ordained Unitarian minister, and served as an executive member of the Western Canadian Unitarian Council; in the 1930s, he studied at the University of Icelandic so as to be able to conduct services in that language. He also served on the Winnipeg School Board from 1942 to 1951, and was a member of the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Winnipeg Municipal Hospital Commission, and the Welfare Council of Winnipeg. In 1953, Petursson gained attention in Winnipeg's religious community for speaking out against the concept of hell.

He ran for the Canadian House of Commons in the federal election of 1949 in the riding of Norquay, but lost to Liberal Robert James Wood by almost 4000 votes. He ran again the federal election of 1965, this time placing third in Winnipeg South Centre against Progressive Conservative Gordon Churchill and Liberal Fred Douglas.

Petursson was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1966 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Richard Seaborn in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Wellington. In 1968-69, he supported Edward Schreyer to replace Russell Paulley as leader of the provincial NDP. He was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1969 election, in which the NDP formed a minority government under Schreyer.

On July 17, 1969, Petursson was named Minister of Cultural Affairs. It was always intended that he would return to the backbenches after a brief period in office, and he was indeed dropped from cabinet on November 4, 1970. Peturrson remained an active parliamentarian, and was re-elected in the election of 1973. He did not seek re-election in 1977.

"Cancelled" is episode 704 of the Comedy Central series South Park. It originally aired on March 19, 2003.

In terms of production, this is the 100th episode, though "I'm a Little Bit Country", was actually aired as such. Its production was alluded to in a joke in the episode.

 Plot .


This episode begins in a manner very similar to the first  episode, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", with Eric Cartman
Cartman]] arriving and talking about a dream where he was abducted by aliens. When the children realize this, they and Chef decide to do something about the anal probe Cartman has; they first see a proctologist, then a scientist. They discover the satellite dish in Cartman's butt is sending off pictures of Earth into space; then a group of Visitors show up, and the children and Chef flee. However, the children are ultimately abducted.

The kids wake up on the ship, and meet Najix, an alien who looks like Stan's dad, explaining to them that he chose an appearance that would be most pleasing to them. The disappointed children say it's like the movie Contact which "sucked." He shows his true form, a terrifying monster, so the children have him go through a series of transformations, mostly of celebrities, until Cartman suggests "a taco that craps ice cream". Najix then explains he and the other aliens make a reality show called Earth, which Chef and the scientists discover at the same time on Earth; they proceed to tell everyone, which leads the alien network heads to cancel the show and prepare to destroy the Earth.

The boys go to Planet Fognl to meet the alien heads, who are "Joozians", a species that control all media in the Universe. The aliens don't listen to the boys, but insist on taking them to lunch, a "hekma"(topless) bar, then get a prostitute's hotel room. The two Joozians then, very drunk and high on "blach", begin sucking on each others' "jagons" and sticking their fingers in each others "thrushers." Kenny takes a picture of it, and the boys then blackmail the aliens with it. The Joozians agree to erase everyone's memory of the truth about Earth, then send the oblivious boys back to their own planet. Kenny still has the picture, and though no one can remember what it is, Chef tells Kenny to keep it, as he feels sure it's something very important.

References to popular culture.
Sounds from the game Doom are used in this episode (the door open and close sound).
The movie Contact is parodied.
The alien construction (and tearing down) of the Earth is a reference to Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.;
The opening of the decrypted alien reality-TV show resembles the initial opening of Star Trek: The Next Generation, that was only used during the first season.
The alien chase scene in the first act parodies the archetypal chase scene in The Dukes of Hazzard.  A caricature of Boss Hogg can be seen on a billboard during the chase scene, with the words "Eat Big Pig's BBQ." The alien giving chase also impersonates the cackling laugh of Sheriff Roscoe P Coltrane.
The children wake up aboard the alien ship, sealed into cubicles with a slimy substance. This is a reference to the Alien movies. However, Cartman initially believes that he is stuck inside Helen Hunt's ass.;

The plot of the episode also parodies The Truman Show.
According to the shape-shifting alien, each planet has only one species living on it. This is a reference to popular science fiction works such as Star Trek in which each alien species seems to exist on a world without (or at least extremely limited) additional animal life.
The Saddam Hussein form the shapeshifting alien takes on and the song he sings is a parody on a scene right at the end of 1987's Mel Brooks Spaceballs movie.
The scientist, named Jeff,  trying to help the boys and Chef looks like a South Park version of Jeff Goldblum. In a reference to Independence Day, when puzzling out alien technology and action, Jeff Goldblum's character follows unlikely chains of thought to come to conclusions that, curiously, turn out to be exactly correct.
The clip where people are running scared across a bridge is from the Danish monster horror movie Reptilicus.

The "Joozians".
The "Joozians" who run the universe's media are parodies of Jews and the charge that Jews secretly run the media; they are shown with stereotypically Jewish appearance (such as their very large noses), use words that sound like Hebrew and when Kyle (who is Jewish) samples some of their food and likes it the aliens claim that he seems to have "Joozian ancestry" to which Cartman replies "Tell us about it." Their symbol is a seven-pointed star reminiscent of the Star of David.
The Joozians congratulate the boys for having their show (Earth) make it to 100 episodes. "Cancelled" is however only the 97th episode of South Park, the true 100th episode is "I'm a Little Bit Country", in which Stan's Dad tells the viewers it is the 100th episode.
The Joozians says a show should never go past 100 episodes because it then goes into weird stories and settings. This is followed by a pause, where the Joozians are sitting and staring blankly into the camera. This is a joke because the show was 3 episodes from its 100th and the episode features a weird plot where Earth is actually a TV show for aliens.
In syndication, the reference to the Joozians' apparent oral sex is sometimes cut out.

Miscellanea.
The title sequence is changed slightly, Timmy is replaced with Kenny who was "resurrected" in Red Sleigh Down.
Forms that the alien takes on: Randy Marsh (Stan's dad), Santa Claus, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jordan, Don King, George Burns, Saddam Hussein, Jimmie Walker, Missy Elliot, and Mr. Roarke and Tattoo from Fantasy Island.
During Fognl's television preview for Earth you can hear Trey Parker saying "derp", a word popularized on the set of BASEketball and in the episode "The Biggest Douche in the Universe".
This episode originally aired on the night the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq began. It is referenced at the very end of the episode. In fact it began almost the same hour as the bombs started falling on Baghdad.
In episode 609 (Free Hat), a fake commercial satirically claimed that Matt and Trey had always wanted to digitally remaster the pilot episode, turning the alien spaceship into a "4.0-megapixel digitally dropped masterpiece". It has been suggested that this episode is exactly that: a digitally remastered version of the first South Park episode, Cartman Gets an Anal Probe.
The planet Marklar, from Starvin' Marvin in Space, is mentioned by the Joozians as a source of subjects for their next show.

<doc id="6018331" title="Great Lakes-Atlantic Coast derecho" nonfiltered="1311" processed="1294" dbindex="1481325">


The Great Lakes-Atlantic Coast derecho was a series of severe wind events associated with powerful thunderstorms, known as Derechos, that occurred between July 17 and July 21, 2006 across a wide swath of north-central and northeastern North America stretching from the Upper Midwest, through much of Ontario and into the northeastern United States. In the latter storms of the period, the middle Mississippi River Valley was affected, notably the city of St. Louis, Missouri, which took a direct hit on sucessive nights by powerful derechos. During the period over 3,000,000 people across the region were left without power from the storms. Early evidence points to a classic 'Progressive Derecho' that struck parts of northern Michigan, northeastern Ontario and Quebec.

Northeastern Ontario derecho (July 17, 2006).
The Event.

The derecho originated from a severe thunderstorm that was forming across portions of the Upper Peninsula and the northernmost parts of the lower Peninsula of Michigan in the early afternoon hours of July 17. It crossed the North Channel into Northeastern Ontario near Sault Ste. Marie, where it quickly developed into a derecho line. As it crossed Manitoulin Island just south of Sault Ste. Marie in Lake Huron, numerous trees were uprooted and some homes sustained heavy damage. An official wind gust of 128 km/h (80 mp/h) was recorded at the Killarney weather station on the north shore of Lake Huron. Tornado warnings were issued for the area and with the amount of damage reported there may been tornado touchdown(s), although unconfirmed as yet.

At about 3:30-4:00 PM EDT (1930-2000 UTC), the storm raced through Sudbury toppling hydro poles and trees. Highway 69, the major highway that links Sudbury to Toronto had to be shut down because electrical wires blocked the highway. At that point the storm system started to take the form of a comma, signature of a fast-moving progressive derecho. 

At about 5:30 PM EDT (2130 UTC), the storm affected North Bay, a city of over 50,000 and the surrounding Nipissing District. Numerous trees in the town were levelled and many buildings sustained heavy surface and some structural damage. Just south of the city, radio towers and a lighthouse were also demolished by the violent winds. At the nearby Airport, the wind measuring instrument snapped off before the peak gusts could be recorded, some estimates put them higher than 180km/h (111 mp/h). Tornado warnings were also in effect for the area and several were reported (or funnels observed) but none have been confirmed. Within the district, the communities of West Nipissing, Callander, East Ferris and Mattawa, all about five hours north of Toronto, declared states of emergency in the wake of the storm. 

At the same time, the storm affected the Algonquin Park region (mostly the northern portion) and killed at least one Michigan man and injured another, also from Michigan who were on a canoe trip near Kiosk, a small community located at the northern end of the park. 

Through the next two hours the storm entered the Upper Ottawa Valley affecting places in Renfrew County such as Barry's Bay, Deep River, Cobden, Petawawa and Pembroke. There were numerous reports of damage, particularly blown-off or damaged roofs.

After crossing the Pembroke area, the derecho started to lose some steam. At times, the storm moved at a forward speed of 100-120 km/h (65-75 mph) but had slowed down somewhat when in entered the Pontiac region of western Quebec. Also, the north-south oriented line became more disorganized at its southern end. Still, the storms carried a lot of lightning strikes and damaging wind as it crossed portions of the Outaouais region, the city of Gatineau and extreme northern portions of the city of Ottawa, primarily  closer to the Ottawa River at around 9 PM. Areas such as Chelsea, Cantley,  La Peche, Notre-Dame-du-Laus and Kazabazua were hard hit. Spectacular lightning was seen from downtown Ottawa and when the storm was close enough, some pinkish color could have been seen in the northern sky. In the Upper Gatineau region north of the National Capital Region, several houses had damage, and scores of trees were snapped by winds in excess of 90 km/h (55 mph). Five more campers were injured by fallen trees while camping in Notre-Dame du Lauswhich was caused by a microburst. Meanwhile, in the Maniwaki area, a local radio station antenna suffered some extensive damage. Northwest of that town in Grand-Remous, several trailers in a park were heavily damaged or destroyed by the force of the winds, but no injuries were reported there.  Additional damage was reported in the Papineau region further east as well as in Mont-Laurier and the popular tourist village of Mont-Tremblant in the Upper Laurentians. The cities of Ottawa and Gatineau were brushed by the storm but escaped the worst of the effects. 

During the rest of the late evening, the activity weakened as it travelled through southern Quebec and eastern Ontario, but still contained a fair amount of lightning when it crossed the Laurentians north of Montreal. The following day, the remnants of the derecho would re-fire over parts of New England including Maine, but were not as severe as the original cluster.

Aftermath.

As a result of the storm at least one person died in the Algonquin Park region while another person was severely injured as a result of fallen tree. Several other injuries occurred in many areas hit by the storms. Also, two people were briefly missing at the La Vérendrye Wildlife Reserve northwest of Maniwaki, Quebec during the height of the storm.

Hydro One in Ontario reported that over 170,000 customers were left without power in the northeast part of the province and the 90% of the city of North Bay lost power. All of Manitoulin Island was without power. Many others areas including the Sudbury area and the Upper Ottawa Valley towns of Pembroke, Mattawa and Petawawa also had major power outages..  Major outages was also reported in several areas in Quebec particularly in the Outaouais region. 145,000 Hydro-Quebec customers lost power but separate storms in the Rouyn-Noranda, Val d'Or, Montreal, Trois-Rivieres and Quebec City areas contributed to the some of the outages..  However, if the storms would have move a few kilometres south, thus hitting directly populated areas in the city of Ottawa and downtown Gatineau, these numbers would have been much higher and property damage would have been greater.

Final damage assessment from this destructive storm are fully unknown as yet, in part because of the remoteness of large portions of the affected area. It is also uncertain if there were not more injuries or deaths, again due to inaccessibility to parts of the region, especially with trees blocking so many remote roads. Environment Canada will investigate areas with heavy damage to ascertain whether tornadoes touched down, particularly on the Manitoulin Island and in Larder Lake, near Kirkland Lake. But at this stage, almost all damage reports are straight-line in nature and radar imagery also favors a classic 'progressive derecho storm' with winds of up to and possibly exceeding 200 km/h (120 mp/h) at its peak, possibly with embedded tornados. 

Later that evening a powerful cool front crossed southern Ontario causing further storm damage in Ontario (see below).

Central Great Lakes-Upper Midwest derecho (July 17, 2006). 

While the northern part of the system was producing severe damage only within Canada (northeast Ontario/southern Quebec), an associated cold front led to significant damage in the US Midwest and Southern Ontario as it crossed the area later that evening. There were dozens of reports of significant wind and/or tornado damage, especially in Michigan but also in southern Ontario, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and as far south as northern Missouri. The setup was similar along the long cold front, and the hot, humid air mass led to the damaging derecho, although the stronger derecho that affected areas well north of there formed much earlier that day in Upper Michigan just before noon local time. It had a clearly defined bow echo squall line formation, unlike these cells which were more fragmented.

Southern Ontario.

Sweeping from west to east in the late-evening hours, the greatest concentration of damage was centred around Newmarket, Scugog Lake and the Kawartha Lakes region further to the east. Numerous trees and power lines were downed in those areas and one camper was killed when a tree crashed into a camping trailer at the Warsaw Caves Provincial Park 30 km (18 miles) northeast of Peterborough. Official wind gusts reached 98km/h (61 mp/h) at Pearson Airport near Toronto and 107 km/h (66 mp/h) at Peterborough Airport. 
Heavy storms also crossed Essex County in the southwest, associated with southward moving line that hit much of lower Michigan. At least 70,000 people lost power in the south, bringing  in total at least 300,000 customers who lost power in Ontario that day. On July 19, 2006, Environment Canada confirmed two tornadoes hit a residential section of Newmarket. (See Tornadoes of 2006 article)

Michigan.

The hardest-hit areas appear to be in northern and central lower Michigan, particularly in and around Oceana County. Several houses were severely damaged, and many others suffered varying degrees of damage. In addition, the Oceana County Fairgrounds lost at least one of its buildings due to the extreme winds. At least one person was injured in the county. Extensive damage was also reported in Benzie County. Wind speeds of 66 mph (106 km/h) were recorded in Saginaw. 

Agricultural damage was severe; many grape and cherry crops were heavily damaged or destroyed, especially in Antrim, Grand Traverse and Leelanau Counties, which will likely have a devastating effect on farmers as the storm took place while they were at maturity stage.

One person was killed by a lightning strike in the Detroit area. In Michigan, over 270,000 people were without power at the storm's peak.

Wisconsin.

Significant wind damage was also reported that afternoon in parts of Wisconsin, especially the northeastern part around Sheboygan. High winds knocked out power to at least 12,000 people and even knocked vehicles off Interstate 43. Winds were officially estimated to be at least 61 mph (97 km/h) but unofficial readings exceeded 75 mph (120 km/h) in Kohler.   Some thought it was a tornado that hit but it was later confirmed to have been straight-line winds like most of the derecho.

Significant damage was also reported in the city of Manitowoc, where hundreds of trees were blown down city-wide knocking out power to hundreds of households. Winds unofficially reached 60-65mph at the storms peak. No injuries were reported in the state.

Illinois.

More damage was reported in extreme northern Illinois along the same line. Trees and power lines were knocked over all over the northernmost areas, some landing on power poles and buildings. The extreme heat also compounded the problem, forcing emergencies to be declared in several communities.

Over 110,000 people were without power at the peak of the storm in Illinois, from northern Chicagoland to the Mississippi River. Peak wind gusts as high as 70 mph (110 km/h) were recorded
in Stephenson. Some of the hardest hit areas were Crystal Lake, Mundelein, Rockford, Lake Zurich and Buffalo Grove. Damage was reported even in the city of Chicago, particularly on the Northwest Side. Numerous houses even lost their roofs as a result of the severe winds. Several people were injured, some of which were due to lightning strikes.

Iowa. 

One tornado touched down at Tama, along with numerous other hail and high winds reports in the eastern part of the state.

Atlantic Coast derecho (July 18, 2006).

The same system refired on July 18 over the Northeastern United States. It produced similar damage over a large swath of New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.

The event.

Like the system in Ontario, but unlike the squall line of the upper Midwest, this was a continuous series of storms that produced widespread damage along its path.

The most significant line began in western Maryland, then tracked north-northeastward into southeastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and the northern suburbs of New York City before tracking eastward into southern New England. 

They generally moved in an eastward direction, with new cells popping up farther north as old cells dissipated. The first cells affected the southernmost part of Pennsylvania and western New Jersey. A new cell took over in northern New Jersey, crossing southern New York and southern New England.

Tree and power line damage was widespread throughout the entire affected area. A few people were injured, and several other people barely escaped injuries as a result of trees falling onto houses and cars. Some of the most spectacular footage came out of Providence Harbor where a tanker caught in the winds exploded in the harbor while unloading gasoline. Fortunately, it moved away from the dock, preventing severe damage in the harbor.

Two people were killed by fallen trees, both in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

No tornadoes were reported in the region.

Aftermath.

There were hundreds of thousands of people left without power all across the region. In the Philadelphia area alone, over 500,000 people were left without power at the peak of the storm, according to PECO and PSE&G.  Many customers will be without power until the weekend at least. It took place just after PECO had set record highs for electricity usage as a result of the preceding extreme heat wave. Power crews from as far away as Chicago were called in to help restore power, after fixing up their damage from the previous day's storms. A state of emergency was also declared in Bucks County, Pennsylvania as a result of the storm.

In northern New Jersey, about 110,000 people were without power at the peak of the storm.

In New England, the damage was just as severe. Over 22,000 customers lost power in Connecticut at its peak. In Rhode Island, that number was 30,000.

Railroad service was also badly affected, with several lines in northern New Jersey and southern New York completely blocked by debris and their electric trains disrupted by power outages on several lines.

The wind graphic from the SPC shows an extensive trail of wind damage, with over 100 reports in the region.


St. Louis-Upper Mississippi River Derecho Events (July 19-21, 2006).

Two powerful derechos about 36 hours apart made direct hits on St. Louis.  The first occurred on the evening of July 19 and the second occurred during the mid-day hours on July 21.  In all 9 storm related deaths were reported with 7 confirmed tornadoes.


The first storm cut power to over 590,000 customers in the St. Louis metropolitan area and injured 30 baseball fans at Busch Stadium.  Ameren reported that it was the worst outage in their 100 year history.  It also hit an extensive swath of the Upper Mississippi River valley including sections of Illinois.  A wind gust of 92 mp/h (146 km/h) was recorded in Macoupin County.  Also affected were parts of Iowa, southern Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. 


The second storm struck after power had been restored to 375,000 customers.  With 80 mp/h winds the storm battered the same areas that had been affected previously.  Ameren estimated that the total number of power outages from both storms exceeded 1 million.

Heatwave.



The derecho that crossed into Ontario and Quebec was the result of a warm and very humid airmass that had plagued much of Central and Eastern Canada and the vast majority of the continental U.S. 
Temperatures in Toronto, Ottawa, Windsor and Montreal were approaching 35°C (95°F) for a few days including the day of the storms, while Heat Index values were exceeding well over 40°C (104°F) in some areas. Temperatures hit 100°F (38°C) at LaGuardia Airport in New York on July 18th and in St. Louis, Missouri on July  19th, before storms pummeled those metropolitan areas. 
This heat wave was somewhat similar in structure but less deadly than the 1995 Heat Wave which had also spawned several destructive derechos across the Great Lakes.

Near-derecho events related to the heat.

After an initial cooldown period after the mid-July storms, the intense heat built-up again over the Great lakes region toward the end of July sparking another series of severe storms. 
Other near-derecho events occurred on; July 31 in Eastern Ontario, August 1 in southern Quebec from the upper Laurentians to the Eastern Townships and on August 2 from eastern Michigan to southeastern Ontario. The meteorological conditions were quite similar to the July 17 events. However, damage was less widespread but there were several dozen tornadoes reported (8 in Ontario alone - a single day record held since 1985), most of them contained within supercells that struck the central south cottage country part of that province.

The son of retired Marine Brigadier General Henry Clay Cochrane (1842-1913), Edward Lull Cochrane was born at Mare Island, California in 1892.  He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1910 and was commissioned as a Navy ensign upon graduation in 1914.  During World War I, he served at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and transferred to the Navy's Construction Corps.  He graduated in 1920 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with a Master of Science degree in Naval Architecture.  

Between the World Wars, Cochrane served in various positions related to shipbuilding.  including in the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair, predecessor to the Bureau of Ships.

He assumed the post of Chief, BuShips in November 1942, succeeding Rear Admiral Alexander H. Van Keuren.  From January 1941 until assuming command of the bureau, Cochrane served as the Assistant Head of the Design Division.

Academic career.
Cochrane retired from the Navy in 1947, while serving as a member of the President's Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine.  He then joined the faculty of MIT, serving from 1947-1950 as head of the Department of Ocean Engineering (originally known as the Department of Naval Architecture), and from 1952-1954 as head of the School of Engineering.

Last years and legacy.
Vice Admiral Cochrane died in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 14, 1959, at the age of 67.

Many of Vice Admiral Cochrane's papers are held at the Naval Historical Center at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.  The papers include documents pertaining to the reorganization of the Bureau of Ships during World War II as well as transcripts of official speeches given by Admiral Cochrane during his term as head of that Bureau. Additionally, there are many personal papers and photographs relating to the Admiral's close association with civilian Naval Architecture and engineering organizations.

Awards and honors.
Cochrane received many awards and honors for his contributions to naval architecture, and more generally to the field of engineering.  He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1953 received honorary membership in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

MIT's Admiral Edward L. Cochrane Award is presented each year to an outstanding student athlete.  The award goes to a male senior for demonstrating humility, leadership and inspiration in intercollegiate sports.

The USS Cochrane (DDG 21), a Charles F. Adams-class guided missile armed destroyer, was named in his honor.

Howling VI: The Freaks is a 1991 horror film that premiered on home video. It was directed by Hope Perello, from the screenplay by Kevin Rock. Based on the novels by Gary Brandner, it stars Brendan Hughes, Bruce Payne, Michele Matheson, Sean Gregory Sullivan, and Carol Lynley. 102 minutes, rated R. Artisan Home Entertainment has released this film along with Howling V: The Rebirth as a double feature on DVD.
The premise of the movie bares some resemblance to Gary Brandners third Howling novel.

Plot summary.




Ian, a likeable but severely solitary drifter takes a job making repairs at the local church in the barren rural town of Canton Bluff. Eschewing human contact, Ian seems unnaturally leery of the impending full moon, a fear shared by a man named R.B. Harker, the owner of a sleazy traveling carnival. Aware that Ian is a genuine werewolf, Harker is able to blackmail the young man into working for his carnival, where he is put on display with other human oddities. To further complicate matters, Harker is revealed to have a monstrous secret of his own; he is a vampire, who sees Ian's condition as a cover for preying on the blood of local folk. Ian joins forces with the other carnival freaks to destroy their evil master.

Reception.
The reception for this film was somewhat mediocre at best. Leonard Maltin wrote in his book 2002 Movie & Video Guide that Howling VI is "Intelligentally written, especially for this series, but Pretentious with vague Ray Bradburyesque undertones". The DVD & VIDEO GUIDE 2004 noted that " Special effects that leave a lot to be desired diminish this really strange entry in the long-running werewolf series"


A few reviewers, however, gave a warmer reception to Bruce Payne as R.B. Harker:
"Bruce Payne is wonderful as Harker. R. B. Harker played by Bruce Payne is the one thing that makes this film watchable. His unrepentantly evil Harker is wonderful, aristocratic, neither over or underplayed. In the traditional style, he sleeps in earth of his native soil, comes out at night and is killed by a stake through the heart. Harker metamorphoses into a pointy eared blue monster hideously deformed reminiscent of the 1922 Nosferatu, with the long talons. He wields power over the freaks, but can charm normal people. Alas, he is not introduced until 20 minutes into the film, and he is never explicitly referred to as a vampire which is a shame, more vampiric activity please!"

Simon Peter Randolph (b. January 10, 1835   d. January 15, 1909), was a pioneer steamboat captain in the Kent Valley. He was born in Logan County, Illinois to Brooks Randolph and Susan Dotson.

His obituary states that he came to Seattle in 1868 and "...was engaged in transporting coal for the Lake Washington Coal Company..."

"In 1871, a new entry joined the growing competition for the White River transportation trade. Captain Simon Peter Randolph had been active in boating on the Duwamish and Black Rivers and Lake Washington since 1868, and was responsible for dredging much of the lower White River, clearing it of many logs and snags."

At first the round trip took four days, gradually he dredged the river clearing it of snags.  He also cleared the Black River between its outlet and the Duwamish River.

Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic is a remixed version of  (formerly known as Prince)'s Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic 1999 album. It was released via mail exclusively through the NPG Music Club, an Internet subscription service, on 29 April, 2000.

The album makes a number of alterations to its predecessor. Five tracks ( Rave In2 The Joy Fantastic ,  Undisputed (The Moneyappolis Mix) ,  The Greatest Romance Ever Sold ,  Hot Wit U (Nasty Girl Remix)  and  Man  O  War (Remix) ) have been remixed or had substantial musical elements added. Seven tracks ( So Far, So Pleased,   Eye Love U, But Eye Don t Trust U Anymore,   Silly Game,   Whatever U Do, Wherever U Go", "The Sun, The Moon And Stars ,  Tangerine  and  Prettyman ) are mostly unchanged, save for slightly longer fade-outs or extended pieces of music. Lastly, two tracks, "Strange but True" and "Everyday Is A Winding Road", have been removed and replaced by the moody "Beautiful Strange", a previously unreleased track written in 1998.

As it was released via the fan-centric NPG Music Club, the album received virtually no attention from wider media. However, with several improved songs, the removal of two weaker tracks, and the addition of "Beautiful Strange", one of the album's highlights, fans generally consider Rave In2 The Joy Fantastic to be superior to its predecessor.

The ballbarrow was a type of wheelbarrow designed by James Dyson and released in 1974 in the United Kingdom. It used a ball instead of a wheel and had several benefits in that the ball did not dig into the ground like a wheel, steering was much easier and the plastic hopper was easier to clean than the galvanized alternatives. The original version did, however have a galvanized steel hopper, and this made it easier to mix cement and other mixtures in it. The plastic version was never as robust , and therefore not as popular as the original version, and subsequently, Dyson sold the manufacturing rights to an American company, who never pursued manufacturing the product.

RULE (Run Up-to-Date Linux Everywhere) is a project that aims to use up-to-date Linux software on old PCs (5 years old or more), by recompiling and changing some code to recent programs in order to make them use less resources so they can run conveniently.

The Reasons.
The principal advantages of using old PCs with up to date software are:
support for more up-to-date standards (html4, java etc.);
more secure to use because of patched security holes;
old PCs may consume less energy than new ones, making them cheaper to use and reducing pollution;
re-use PCs that would otherwise be discarded;
PCs aren't cheap, especially for third world or Eastern European countries, or for big volumes (for example a school needs a lot of PCs.);

Information about the project.
The main OS's are Fedora Core 2 and Red Hat 8/9, but users/developers with another OS are welcomed.
The main activity of the RULE site is to test contributors' packages and provide user documentation and easy installation procedures.

The mission of the Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines of the World Health Organization is "to help save lives and improve health by closing the huge gap between the potential that essential drugs have to offer and the reality that for millions of people -- particularly the poor and disadvantaged -- medicines are unavailable, unaffordable, unsafe or improperly used."

<doc id="4077778" title="Amelia Voght" nonfiltered="1338" processed="1320" dbindex="1481353">
 

Amelia Voght is a Marvel Comics character, associated with the X-Men franchise. Created by Scott Lobdell and John Romita, Jr., she first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #300 (May 1993).

A mutant with the ability to turn her body into mist, Amelia was a love interest of Professor X before he founded the X-Men. Unable to believe in his mission, she eventually joined Magneto s Acolytes, becoming one of Magneto's most trusted lieutenants.

History.
Amelia was a nurse who cared for Charles Xavier after his legs were first injured. Stationed in Tibet, Amelia was glad to see another American and her positive and friendly attitude helped Xavier to get over the depression he developed when his legs were injured. At first their relationship was professional, but it soon became romantic. They left Tibet together and Amelia returned with Xavier to the United States. Xavier, also a mutant, had encountered Magneto and the Shadow King and was developing a machine called Cerebro to track mutants, hoping to protect and educate them, so they wouldn't turn into a threat. Amelia found the plans and thought that Xavier was developing the machine to hunt down and exterminate mutants. She revealed herself as a mutant and attacked him, only stopped when Xavier revealed his own mutant powers. This link strengthened their relationship even more, but over time they both developed different stances on human-mutant interaction. Xavier wanted co-existence with the humans, while Amelia thought it was best for mutants to stay underground. When Xavier brought Scott Summers to his mansion for training, Amelia left him, telling him that his plans for the X-Men would doom all mutants. Xavier involuntarily used his telepathy to convince her otherwise, but managed to stop himself. Amelia noticed as well and felt betrayed. 

She would stay hidden for the next few years, but when human-mutant relationships deteriorated, she was recruited by Fabian Cortez and became a member of the second lineup of the Acolytes, followers of Magneto, who she had met with Xavier years before. As one of the older and more experienced mutants, she was given a position of seniority within the group, even though she didn't agree with some of the Acolytes' more extreme policies, like the killing of humans. Over the years she would support the Acolytes and Magneto, but she would also try to limit casualties and gave limited aid to the X-Men and other superheroes like Quicksilver who opposed them.  

She eventually became disillusioned with the Acolytes' extremist stance and left the group. 

Amelia is also one of a handful of mutants to retain their powers following the events of the House of M.

Powers.
Amelia Voght has the power of transsubstantiation, enabling her to convert matter into a psionically-resonant vapor at will. This mist became Amelia's own natural state after her powers kicked in, and she is capable of transforming herself or any person or object in her line-of-sight into this state. Loose mist is of course virtually insubstantial, and so Amelia can use this power to avoid injury. She can control the flow of the vapor through the air, allowing her to fly, squeeze herself through tight passages, or move objects about -- she could pull a person out from under a mob attacking them by dispersing and reforming them nearby, or steal her opponents' weapons by vaporizing them into their hands and bringing them to her own. Voght's mist can also be transported through the astral plane, allowing her to employ her powers for long range teleportation. She is able to transport herself and anything else she transsubstantiates across the surface of the globe in an instant, or to and from orbit around the planet. She can teleport with cargo, or send objects to a new location without traveling with them, providing she can visualize the new location in her mind. On certain occasions, Voght even demonstrated the ability to summon distant people to herself by teleportation, visualizing wherever the person is at the moment, seeing them converted into mist, and then bringing that mist into her presence to be reformed.

Shandon is an unincorporated community of southeastern Morgan Township, Butler County, Ohio on Paddys Run, a tributary of the Great Miami River, about four miles west of Ross at the intersection of State Routes 748 and 126 in section 25 of R1ET3N of the Congress Lands.  It was originally called Glendower as the town was settled by immigrants from Wales.  It was later called New London and this survives in the name of Alert-New London Road.  The town is in the Ross Local School District.

History.
The foundation for the first Welsh settlement in Ohio was laid on June 29, 1801, when William and Morgan Gwilym purchased land in what is now Morgan Township at the Cincinnati Land Office. The township was named after General Daniel Morgan for his victories in the American Revolutionary War; he too was a Welsh descendant from the colony of Virginia.  Settlement in the Paddy s Run area started in 1802, a year before Ohio became the 17th state. The land was then in Hamilton County. Ohio s first General Assembly carved Butler County out of Hamilton County March 24, 1803. Hamilton was selected as the county seat July 15, 1803. Shandon may be the Butler County community that s had the most names in its 200-year history. Although settled by Welsh, its first post office created June 10, 1831 bore an Irish name, Paddy s Run. It s also been known, officially and unofficially, as Cambria, Glendower, Vaughan, New London and Bagdad before becoming Shandon more than 110 years ago. 

Ohio nineteenth Governor William Bebb (December 8, 1802 - October 23, 1873) was an early resident of Paddy's Run, before entering politics he ran a boarding school for boys here which was called "Bebb's High". 

Some original Welsh settlers are also buried in the New London (Paddy's Run) Cemetery. The cemetery is adjacent to the old Congregational Church. The church was founded 1803, a brick Mettinghouse was built in 1824 and it is now being restored as the Community House. The present church was built in 1854. The church and cemetery are on Alert-New London Road in Morgan Township.

The Hannover Boys Choir (Knabenchor Hannover) was founded in 1950 by Professor Heinz Hennig and conducted until the end of 2001. Since 2002, the conductor is Professor Jörg Breiding.

The Hannover Boys Choir has traditionally specialized in the works of seventeenth Century composers, its main focus at first having been on the works of Heinrich Schütz. The choir's five Schütz recordings under Hennig's baton produced between 1982 and 1999 not only set new standards for performances of this repertoire, but four of them won prizes as well (amongst them the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis). The choir turned its attention to Andreas Hammerschmidt in 1998 when it recorded some of his sacred choral music and suites. 

The Hannover Boys Choir was among the first choirs to take an interest in
historical performance practices and in doing so achieved a quality of musicianship that has since won it acclaim not just in Germany but internationally as well. World-class musicians such as Gustav Leonhardt, Ton Koopman and Christoph Eschenbach have all worked with the choir, as have such famous orchestras as the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, the Academy of Ancient Music Berlin and countless German radio orchestras.

Besides giving concerts and performing at festivals both in Germany and abroad (including Israel, Japan, Russia, South and Central America, the US and South Africa), the Hannover Boys Choir also records regularly and can frequently be heard on the radio.

In 2006, the Hannover Boys Choir was awarded with the famous Echo Klassik in the category "choral works - recording of the year" for the CD  Verleih uns Frieden . It contains the world's first recording of several works by Andreas Hammerschmidt that were believed lost for more than 350 years.

<doc id="993" title="Analog signal" nonfiltered="1343" processed="1325" dbindex="1481358">
An analog or analogue  is any variable signal continuous in both time and amplitude. It differs from a digital signal in that small fluctuations in the signal are meaningful. Analog is usually thought of in an electrical context, however mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and other systems may also convey analog signals.

An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. Electrically, the property most commonly used is voltage followed closely by frequency, current, and charge.

Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal, often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, position, or pressure, and is achieved using a transducer.

For example, in an analog sound recording, the variation in pressure of a sound striking a microphone creates a corresponding variation in the voltage amplitude of a current passing through it. An increase in the volume of the sound causes the fluctuation of the current's voltage amplitude to increase while keeping the same rhythm.

Since most natural data is analog before the digital conversion required to get a digital signal, resolution of analog recording and transmitting technology has been higher until recent times. For practical reasons such as memory conservation and the cost of phasing out older digital recordings, the resolution of some digital signals may remain lower than most analog signals.  For this reason, some audiophiles prefer analog technology. However, in many cases, the difference is too minimal to be noticed. 

Disadvantage.
The primary disadvantage of analog signaling is that any system has noise   i.e., random variation. As the signal is copied and re-copied, or transmitted over long distances, these random variations become dominant. Electrically, these losses can be diminished by shielding, good connections, and several cable types such as coaxial or twisted pair.

The effects of noise make signal loss and distortion impossible to recover, since amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well. Even if the resolution of an analog signal is higher than a comparable digital signal, in many cases, the difference is overshadowed by the noise in the signal.

Modulation.
Another method of conveying an analog signal is to use modulation. In this, some base signal (e.g., a sinusoidal carrier wave) has one of its properties modulated: amplitude modulation involves altering the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage waveform by the source information, frequency modulation changes the frequency. Other techniques, such as changing the phase of the base signal also work.

Analog circuits do not involve quantisation of information into digital format. The concept being measured over the circuit, whether sound, light, pressure, temperature, or an exceeded limit, remains from end to end.

Clocks with hands are called analog; those that display digits are called digital. However, many analog clocks are actually digital since the hands do not move in a smooth continuous motion, but in small steps every second or half a second, or every minute.

See digital for a discussion of digital vs. analog.

The Leeds Pals were a First World War Pals battalion of Kitchener's Army raised in the West Yorkshire city of Leeds.  When the battalion was taken over by the British Army it was officially named the 15th Battalion (1st Leeds), The Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment).

The battalion was formed in September 1914 and underwent training at Colsterdale in the Yorkshire Dales. It became part of the 93rd Brigade of the 31st Division, along with the two Bradford Pals battalions (16th and 18th Battalions, The West Yorkshire Regiment).  In December 1915 the Leeds Pals were deployed to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal from the threat of the Ottoman Empire.

In March 1916 the battalion landed in France, joining the British build up for the Battle of the Somme.  On the first day on the Somme, 1 July 1916, the 31st Division attacked towards the village of Serre and the Leeds Pals advanced from a line of copses named after the Gospels.  The battalion was shelled in its trenches before Zero Hour (7.30 am) and when it advanced, it was met by heavy machine gun fire.  A few men got as far as the German barbed wire but no further.  Later in the morning the German defenders came out to clear the bodies off their wire, killing any that were still alive.  The battalion casualties, sustained in the few minutes after Zero, were 24 officers and 504 other ranks, of which 15 officers and 233 other ranks were killed.

"The name of Serre and the date of 1st July is engraved deep in our hearts, along with the faces of our 'Pals', a grand crowd of chaps.  We were two years in the making and ten minutes in the destroying." (Private A.V. Pearson, Leeds Pals);

In December 1917 the Leeds Pals were amalgamated with the 2nd Leeds battalion (17th Battalion, The West Yorkshire Regiment, a Bantam battalion) to form the 15th/17th Battalion, The West Yorkshire Regiment.

The Baltimore Science Fiction Society is a literary society focusing on science fiction, fantasy and related genera. Based in Baltimore, Maryland, the BSFS sponsors Balticon, the Maryland Regional Science Fiction Convention, and a young writers contest for Maryland students named "The Jack L. Chalker Young Writers Contest." It maintains a free lending library, and conducts other public outreach events promoting literacy.

The BSFS has presented "The Compton Crook Award" each Balticon SM (since 1983) for "... the best first novel in the genre published during the previous year ...". The list of eligible books is published in the monthly newsletter so all club members will have a chance to read and vote. The winning author is invited to Balticon SM (BSFS pays transportation and lodging) and presented with the cash award. Compton Crook, who used the nom de plume Stephen Tall, died in 1981. He was a long time Baltimore resident, Towson University professor, and of course, a science fiction author.

History.
The Baltimore Science Fiction Society was first formed on  January 5, 1963, on the back seat of a Trailways bus, by people returning from a meeting of the Washington Science Fiction Association (WSFA). It went into suspended animation as an organization after an election of officers which proved disastrous on October 12, 1968, on a (non-functioning) streetcar. Its only production of consequence was starting Balticon SM (1966) and it has in common with the present group only the name, spirit, Balticon and continuity of the same three founding members.

There was no formal BSFS during the intervening years, but several fans managed to keep the Balticon SM tradition alive by holding Balticons SM number 3 through 8.

Present.
The present Baltimore Science Fiction Society was re-started in 1974 when it was incorporated in the State of Maryland.  It applied for and was granted IRS tax exempt status.

BSFS is the third Science Fiction society in the country to own their own meeting place. LASFS (Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society) and NESFA (New England Science Fiction Association) are the other two. The former theater at 3310 East Baltimore Street, in the Highlandtown section of Baltimore, is being slowly renovated as time and money allow. On December 15, 2004 after a long fight by BSFS the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled favorably on the tax exemption status of the BSFS building reversing a ruling by the Maryland State Department of Assessment and Taxation forcing a revision of the Maryland Property tax code for literary organizations and other non-profit organizations. BSFS maintains a popular SF resources website with something for everyone who likes science fiction in any of its cultural art forms.

<doc id="995809" title="Conjugated linoleic acid" nonfiltered="1351" processed="1332" dbindex="1481366">
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a family of many geometric isomers of linoleic acid (at least 13 are reported), which are found primarily in the meat and dairy products of ruminants. 

Conjugated linoleic acid is a trans fat, though some researchers claim that it is not harmful in the same fashion as other trans fatty acids, but rather is beneficial.  CLA is a conjugated system, and in the United States, trans linkages in a conjugated system are not counted as trans fat for the purposes of nutritional regulations and labeling. Unlike most trans fatty acids found in the human diet, CLA occurs naturally, produced by microorganisms in the fore-stomach of ruminants. Non-ruminants, such as humans, may be able to produce some isomers of CLA from non-conjugated ruminant fats. One such example is vaccenic acid, which could be converted to CLA by delta-9-desaturase.

CLA comes in two isomers: the c9,t11 isomer (rumenic acid) which appears responsible for improving muscle growth, and the t10,c12 isomer which primarily prevents lipogenesis (storage of fat in adipose tissue). Most supplements sold in stores contain a 50/50 mix of both isomers. 

Various antioxidant and anti-tumor properties have been attributed to CLA, and studies on mice and rats show promising results; however, it is suspected that sufficient concentrations to achieve anti-inflammatory effects within human tissues may not be attainable via oral consumption. 

Many studies on CLA in humans show a tendency for reduced body fat, particularly abdominal fat, changes in serum total lipids and decreased whole body glucose uptake. The maximum reduction in body fat mass was achieved with a 3.4 g daily dose.

CAS registry number: 2420-56-6, Molecular Formula: C18H32O2

 Other benefits .
CLA may be beneficial in other aspects, including prevention of breast and colon cancer, and prevention of insulin resistance and type II diabetes.   

Additional potential benefits include a reduction in food-induced allergic reactions, as well as the overall enhancement of the immune system. 

 Possible Side Effects .
There are concerns that the use of CLA may actually cause insulin resistance, leading to an increased risk for developing diabetes. 

A recent study (2006) conducted in mice by the US Department of Agriculture gives account of some highly concerning effects of CLA: it can dramatically induce essential fatty acid redistribution (DHA and AA) in various organ tissues. 
The same study raises the concern that it might pose significant risks, especially regarding cardiovascular health and inflammatory diseases. DHA content in heart tissue for instance was found to be reduced by no less than 25% by certain CLA isomers, while spleen DHA increased 6-fold and spleen AA was reduced to only 5% of its normal levels in that tissue. . Another study (2005) of CLA supplementation of hatching chicks showed high mortality and low hatchability rate among the CLA-supplemented groups, and also a decrease in brain DHA levels of CLA-incubated chicks. 

Dosage.
CLA is available commercially in doses of about 500mg to 1000mg (or .5 g to 1 g). The optimal dosage is about 3.4 g, with larger doses showing little or no improvement. 

CLA should be taken with protein-rich food to prevent side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, and stomachache. 

 Dietary Sources .
Kangaroo meat may have the highest concentration of CLA when compared with other foods.
Food products of grass-fed ruminants (eg lamb, beef) are good sources, and contain much more CLA than those from grain-fed animals.

The Silver Fish is the highest award in the Girl Guiding/Scouting movement. It is awarded for outstanding service to the movement. 

History.

The award of Silver Fish existed from the beginning of the Guiding movement. It is mentioned in the November 1909 edition of the Boy Scout Headquarters Gazette in "The Scheme for 'Girl Guides'". Here a girl must pass seventeen specified efficiency badges. However, in Pamphlet A: Baden-Powell Girl Guides, a Suggestion for Character Training for Girls, also published in 1909, twenty efficiency badges were needed to obtain the Silver Fish. This was later reduced to fifteen and, additionally, good all round work was required. The award was considered a sign of a girl 'who could make her way upstream'.

In October 1917, the award changed to being given for outstanding service to the movement. At this time, the design also changed from a whiting with its tail in its mouth worn on a silver chain to a swimming fish worn on a dark and light blue striped ribbon. 

Olave Baden-Powell was presented with a gold Silver Fish in 1918, then the only one of its kind. In 1995, Betty Clay was presented with a gold Silver Fish in the form of a brooch.

<doc id="173732" title="Interpedia" nonfiltered="1356" processed="1337" dbindex="1481371">
The Interpedia  was the name given to the first proposals for an Internet encyclopedia which would allow anyone to contribute by writing articles and submitting them to the central catalog of all Interpedia pages. 

Interpedia was initiated by Rick Gates, who reportedly posted on 22 October, 1993 the following to the Usenet newsgroup alt.internet.services:

The more I thought about this, the more I realized that such a resource, containing general, encyclopedic knowledge for the layman, would be an important tool for some types of research, and for the Net.Citizenry in general.;

Ahh.. but what about contributors... where will you find authors to write the short articles you need? Well, I'd first have to start out by finding some way of communicating with an extremely diverse set of people... everyone from linguists, to molecular biologists, from animal rights activists to zymurgists, and from geographers to gas chromotographers. Guess what? :-) The Net provides just such an arena! So I thought about it some more...;

... and came to the conclusion that this is a good idea!;

The term Interpedia was coined by R. L. Samuell, a participant in early discussions on the topic.

Discussion initially took place on a high-volume mailing list, and in November, 1993 the Usenet newsgroup comp.infosystems.interpedia was created (see 
).

There was some disagreement about whether all pages should be in HTML, plain text, or whether all formats should be allowed (e.g., as with Gopher). Another point of discussion was whether outside Internet resources not specifically written for the Interpedia could become part of it by simply including them in the catalog. 

Furthermore, several independent "Seal-of-approval" (SOAP) agencies were envisioned which would rate Interpedia articles based on criteria of their own choosing; users could then decide which agencies' recommendations to follow. 

In the end, the project never left the planning stages and finally died, taken over by the explosive growth of the World Wide Web.

<doc id="287468" title="Elihu Root" nonfiltered="1359" processed="1340" dbindex="1481374">


Elihu Root (February 15, 1845   February 7, 1937) was an American lawyer and statesman and the 1912 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. He was the prototype of the 20th century "wise man," who shuttled between high-level government positions in Washington, D.C. and private-sector legal practice in New York City.

Early life and career.
Root was born in Clinton, New York, as the son of Oren Root and Nancy Whitney Buttrick. His father was professor of mathematics at Hamilton College, where Elihu attended college; there he joined the Sigma Phi Society, later becoming its national mentor and spiritual leader. After graduation, Root taught for one year at the Rome Academy.  In 1867, Root graduated from the Law School of New York University. He went into private practice as a lawyer. While mainly practicing corporate law, Root was a junior defense counsel during the corruption trial of William "Boss" Tweed.  Root also had private clients including Jay Gould, Chester A. Arthur, Charles Anderson Dana, William C. Whitney, Thomas Fortune Ryan, and E. H. Harriman.

Root was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York by President Chester A. Arthur. 

Root married Clara Frances Wales (died in 1928), who was the daughter of Salem Wales, the managing editor of Scientific American, in 1878. They had three children: Edith (married Ulysses S. Grant III), Elihu, Jr. (who became a lawyer), and Edward.

Root was a member of the Union League Club of New York and twice served as its president, 1898-99, and again from 1915-16.

Political career.
He served as the United States Secretary of War 1899 1904 under William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. He reformed the organization of the United States Army. He was responsible for enlarging West Point and establishing the U.S. Army War College as well as the General Staff. He changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the new territories acquired after the Spanish-American War and worked out the methods of how Cuba would be turned over to the Cubans, wrote the charter of government for the Philippines, and eliminated tariffs on goods imported to the United States from Puerto Rico. Root left the cabinet in 1904 and returned to private practice as a lawyer. 



In 1905, President Roosevelt named Root to be the United States Secretary of State after the death of John Hay. As secretary, Root placed the consular service under the Civil Service. He maintained the Open Door Policy in the Far East. On a tour to Latin America in 1906, Root persuaded those governments to participate in the Hague Peace Conference. He worked with Japan in emigration to the United States and in dealings with China and established the Root-Takahira Agreement, which limited Japanese and American naval fortifications in the Pacific. He worked with Great Britain in resolving border disputes between the United States (Alaska) and Canada and also in the North Atlantic fisheries. He supported arbitration in resolving international disputes. 

He served in the United States Senate (Republican   New York) from 1909 to 1915, and did not seek reelection. He served as President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from 1910 to 1925. In that capacity, he helped create the Hague Academy of International Law in the Netherlands.

In 1912, as a result of his work to bring nations together through arbitration and cooperation, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.  

At the outbreak of World War I, Root opposed President Woodrow Wilson's policy of neutrality. He did support Wilson once the United States entered the war.

In June 1916, Root sought the Republican presidential nomination.  However, Root reached his peak strength of 103 votes on the first ballot.  The Republican presidential nomination went to Charles Evans Hughes, who lost the election to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. 

In June 1917, at age 72, he was sent to Russia by President Wilson to arrange American co-operation with the new revolutionary government. A large party of well-known people accompanied the Senator, and they traveled from Vladivostok across Siberia in the Czar's former train. Root remained in Petrograd for close to a month, and was not much impressed by what he saw. The Russians, he said, "are sincerely, kindly, good people but confused and dazed." He summed up his attitude to the Provisional Government very trenchantly: "No fight, no loans." Which referred to the current conflict with Germany in World War I.

After World War I, Root supported the League of Nations and served on the commission of jurists, which created the Permanent Court of International Justice. In 1922, President Warren G. Harding appointed him as a delegate to the International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments. He was the founding chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, established in 1921 in New York. 

Root worked with Andrew Carnegie in programs for international peace and the advancement of science. He was the first president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  He was among the founders of the American Law Institute in 1923.


In addition to the Nobel Prize, Root was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) and the Grand Commander of the Order of George I (Greece). He was the second cousin twice removed of Henry Luce, through Elihu Root (1772-1843). Prior to his death, Root had been the last surviving member of the McKinley Cabinet. 

Root died in 1937 in Clinton, New York, with his family by his side.  He is buried at the Hamilton College Cemetery .

Quotes.
"About half of the practice of a decent lawyer is telling would-be clients that they are damned fools and should stop." - Elihu Root

"The trouble is that lawyers necessarily acquire the habit of assuming the law to be right.... As a rule, the pure lawyer seldom concerns himself about the broad aspects of public policy which may show a law to be all wrong, and such a lawyer may be oblivious to the fact that in helping to enforce the law he is helping to injure the public.  Then, too, lawyers are almost always conservative.  Through insisting upon the maintenance of legal rules, they become instinctively opposed to change, and thus are frequently found aiding in the assertion of legal rights under laws which have once been reasonable and fair, but which, through the process of social and business development, have become unjust and unfair without the lawyers seeing it." - Elihu Root 

A few days before the Federal Reserve act was passed Senator Elihu Root denounced the Federal Reserve bill as an outrage on our liberties and made the following prediction:

  "Long before we wake up from our dreams of prosperity through an inflated currency, our gold, which alone could have kept us from catastrophe, will have vanished and no rate of interest will tempt it to return. ;

<doc id="354281" title="Linn Ullmann" nonfiltered="1361" processed="1342" dbindex="1481376">
Linn Ullmann (born 9 August 1966, Oslo, Norway) is the daughter of actress Liv Ullmann and director Ingmar Bergman, and a respected Norwegian author and journalist.

At an early age she occasionally appeared in her mother's films, and had a notable bit part in her father's film of Mozart's The Magic Flute. During the overture, the camera cuts among numerous faces in the opera audience (including, briefly, Bergman's own and that of his long-time cinematographer Sven Nykvist). But the face that recurs regularly during this scene is that of a child, who clearly is quietly entranced by the opera. This is Linn. 

Linn dreamed of becoming an opera singer but dropped the idea since she could not sing. She then decided to follow in the footsteps of her famous mother, but after a few years at a theatre school in New York, the teacher told her she was a terrible actress. "My mother agreed with the teacher", Ullmann has recounted, "so I became a journalist". She studied literature for six years in New York, finally graduating from New York University in 1988 and then she began work on her Ph.D the same year. 

In 1992 she permanently moved back to her native Norway and began to work for the tabloid Dagbladet, one of Norway's largest newspapers.

Eventually she became one of the most prominent newspaper journalists in Norway, and subsequently a highly successful and award winning author. As of 2005 she has written three novels, some of them translated into more than 30 languages, which have received critical acclaim also far outside Norway. Her debut novel, "Before You Sleep" was sold to 14 countries (including the United States, Britain, France and Germany) before it was even published in Norway, a flying start rarely bestowed upon Norwegian authors.

<doc id="6768971" title="Empress Erzhu Ying'e" nonfiltered="1365" processed="1346" dbindex="1481380">
Empress Erzhu Ying'e (    ) (d. 556) was an empress of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei.  She was the wife of Emperor Xiaozhuang and a daughter of the paramount general Erzhu Rong.  She later became a concubine of Northern Wei and Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan.

 Background .
Erzhu Ying'e's father Erzhu Rong had been a hereditary chief of the Qihu (  ) tribe, a branch of the Xiongnu, located at Xiurong (  , in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), and during the agrarian rebellions during Emperor Xiaoming's reign had become increasingly powerful as a military general.  Sometime during Emperor Xiaoming's reign, she became Emperor Xiaoming's concubine with the rank of Pin ( ).  She was described to be capable as a soldier, and she was able to use the bow well.

In 528, Emperor Xiaoming, in a dispute with his mother Empress Dowager Hu over her overly favoring her lover Zheng Yan (  ) and Zheng's associate Xu Ge (  ), conspired with Erzhu Rong to have him advance south toward the capital Luoyang to force Empress Dowager Hu to remove Zheng and Xu.  When Empress Dowager Hu discovered this, she poisoned Emperor Xiaoming to death.  Erzhu Rong refused to recognize the young emperor Yuan Zhao that she put on the throne, instead advancing on Luoyang, capturing it and throwing Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao into the Yellow River to drown.  He also slaughtered a large number of imperial officials and made Emperor Xiaoming's father Emperor Xuanwu's cousin Yuan Ziyou emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhuang).

 As empress .
Erzhu Rong was in control of the military at this point, although Emperor Xiaozhuang retained substantial powers, and Erzhu Rong wanted Emperor Xiaozhuang to marry Erzhu Ying'e as empress to cement the relationship.  Emperor Xiaozhuang initially hesitated, as pursuant to Confucian regulations he would be committing incest if he did.  However, the official Zu Ying (  ) convinced him that the union would be advantage, and so he agreed.  Empress Erzhu was described to be jealous and did not tolerate Emperor Xiaozhuang's other consorts.  Emperor Xiaozhuang once asked her father's cousin Erzhu Shilong to persuade her to be less jealous.  Instead, she told Erzhu Shilong that Emperor Xiaozhuang depended on the Erzhus for his throne and that things could still change; Erzhu Shilong agreed with her.

Worried about the hold that Erzhu Rong had on the military and how he had been willing to slaughter imperial officials (including Emperor Xiaozhuang's own brothers Yuan Shao (  ) and Yuan Zizheng (   ), Emperor Xiaozhuang, during Empress Erzhu's pregnancy in 530, tricked him into entering the palace with his close associate Yuan Tianmu (   ) the Prince of Shangdang and his son Erzhu Puti (    ) and killing them by falsely telling them that Empress Erzhu had given birth.  This precipitated a war between the imperial forces and the Erzhus' forces, which lasted for two months, during which Empress Erzhu gave birth to a son.  Eventually, the Erzhu forces, under the command of Empress Erzhu's cousin Erzhu Zhao, captured Luoyang and deposed (and later killed) Emperor Xiaozhuang, making his distant relative Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang, and then later his cousin Yuan Gong the Prince of Guangling emperor.  Erzhu Zhao also put Emperor Xiaozhuang's and Empress Erzhu's infant son to death.

 As Gao Huan's concubine .
The Erzhus controlled the empire for a while, but in 531, the general Gao Huan, a former subordinate of Erzhu Rong's, rose against them, and by 532 Gao had defeated the Erzhus, becoming the paramount general for Northern Wei (and for the branch state Eastern Wei after Northern Wei's division into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534).  Shortly after Gao's defeating of the Erzhus, she became a concubine of Gao's.  She and another consort that Gao took, the Princess Ruru (a princess of Rouran), were renowned for their military demonstrations, and Gao once commented that these two concubines of his were capable of defeating bandits.  In 535, when Gao Huan was angry with his son Gao Cheng for having had an affair with Gao Huan's concubine Lady Zheng, he considered replacing his wife Lou Zhaojun, Gao Cheng's mother, with Erzhu Ying'e, but ultimately did not do so.  Erzhu Ying'e bore him two sons, Gao You (  ) (later the Prince of Pengcheng) in 533 and Gao Ning (  ) (later the Prince of Huashan).  In spring 545, Erzhu Ying'e's brother Erzhu Wenchang (    ) and Zheng Zhongli (   ), the brother of Gao Huan's other favorite concubine Zheng Dache (   ), along with Ren Zhou (  ), conspired to assassinate Gao Huan and support Erzhu Wenchang as leader, but the conspiracy was discovered, and the conspirators were put to death, along with their families. However, because of Gao Huan's favors for Erzhu Ying'e and Zheng Dache, he spared their brothers.  However, she later became a Buddhist nun, even while Gao Huan was still alive, for reasons lost to history; Gao Huan built a temple for her.

 After Gao Huan's death .
After Gao Huan's death in 547 and his son Gao Yang's abolition of Eastern Wei and establishment of Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan, Erzhu Ying'e carried the title of Princess Dowager of Pengcheng.  In 556, Emperor Wenxuan, while drunk, wanted to have sexual relations with her, and she refused.  He killed her by his own hand.

Nahum (    ) was a minor prophet whose prophecy is recorded in the Hebrew Bible. His book comes in chronological order between Micah and Habakkuk in the Bible. He wrote about the end of the Assyrian Empire, and its capital city, Nineveh, in a vivid poetic style.

Little is known about Nahum s personal history. His name means "comforter," and he was from the town of Alqosh, (Nah 1:1) which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern  `Alqush of Assyria and Capharnaum of northern Galilee. He was a very nationalistic Hebrew however and lived amongst the Elkoshites in peace.  His writings could be taken as prophecy or as history. One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BC, just before the downfall of Assyria, while another account suggests that he wrote this passage as a New Year liturgy for the autumn festival just after the unfortunate downfall in 612 BC. 

Historical context.
Archaeological digs have uncovered the splendor of Nineveh in its zenith under Sennacherib (705-681 BC), Esarhaddon (681-669 BC), and Ashurbanipal (669-633 BC). Massive walls were eight miles in circumference. It had a water aqueduct, palaces and a library with 20,000 clay tablets, including accounts of a creation in Enuma Elish, a flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Epic of Inanna Ishtar. 
The Babylonian chronicle of the fall of Nineveh tells the story of the end of Nineveh. Naboplassar of Babylon joined forces with Cyaxares, king of the Medes, and laid siege for 2 months and apparently were aided by a flooding river which flowed through the city. 
Assyria lasted a few more years after the loss of its fortress, but attempts by Egyptian Pharaoh Neco II to rally the Assyrians failed and it seemed to be all over by 609 BC.  The Assyrian though are still alive and well and thriving today in the North of Mesopotamia.

The tomb of Nahum is supposedly inside the synagogue at Alquosh, although there are other places outside Iraq that lay claim also to being the original 'Elkosh' from which Nahum hailed.  Alquosh was abandoned by its Jewish population in 1948, and the synagogue that purportedly houses the tomb in a poor structural state, to the extent that the tomb itself is in danger of destruction.  A team of US/UK construction engineers, led by Huw Thomas, is currently planning ways to save the building and the tomb.

Theme.
Nahum s thought is warning the Ninevites of the coming events but he is partly in favor of the destruction.  Nahum's prophecy seems to be for modern Assyrians rather than the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC.  The prophet Jonah shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh.   Nahum s writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness of God. The Assyrians had been used as God's "rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation" (Isaiah 10:5).

The book. 
Chapters 1:10-2:2 contain alternating oracles to Nineveh and Judah, and he also proclaim one who will publish peace and good tidings upon the mountains, perhaps Jesus of Nazareth as the mountainous region in North of Mesopotamia was among the first to accept his preaching of love thy neighbour and this was to be seen as a sign as Jesus himself proclaimed Jona was a sign to the world since the supposed most cruel nation repented at his preaching.  "The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment for they repented at the preaching of Jonah" Jesus to his disciples.  

Chapters 2:3-3:19 describe the sack of Nineveh. The lion, the symbol of Assyrian power is made reference to. Nineveh is compared to Thebes, the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed. Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh s troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and metaphors. Nineveh is compared to a lion s den where the lioness and young await the return of the lion with his kill. It comes to conclusion with a satirical warning where Assyria s rulers sleep and merchants flee.

The Beowulf Code is a code of ethics for medical practictioners within the Honorverse (the setting of many science fiction stories by David Weber). It is similar to the Hippocratic Oath.

The Beowulf Code originated on the planet Beowulf, in the Sigma Draconis system. The planet is renown for its medical establishment. Its practictioners developed a code of ethics in the wake of Earth's Final War. It supplants the Hippocratic Oath in the Honor Harrington universe. 

One of the provisions of the code is Practitioner-Patient Confidentiality. However this clause has stipulations on circumstances where Confidentiality can be involuntarily violated, or can be waived by one party without consent of the other party.

<doc id="2796933" title="List of cities in Lithuania" nonfiltered="1373" processed="1354" dbindex="1481388">
In Lithuania there are 103 cities (in Lithuanian: singular - miestas, plural miestai). The term city is defined by the Parliament of Lithuania as compact areas populated by more than 3,000 people of whom at least two thirds work in the industry or service sector. Those settlements which have a population of less than 3,000 but historically had city status are still considered to be cities. Smaller settlements are called miestelis (plural miesteliai) which is translated as towns. Even smaller settlements (villages) are called kaimas (plural kaimai). Often the official status is not clear and people refer to both towns and villages as gyvenviet  (plural gyvenviet s) which in essence means settlement.

The cities started to form in the 13th-14th century together with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first city to receive city rights was Klaip da. According to medieval law, a city could have its own fairs, taverns, guilds, courts, etc. Some former cities lost their status are now just towns or villages, for example Kernav  or Merkin . Most of the cities in Lithuania are old, established before the 18th century. Their location is mostly determined by trade and transportation routes. Some of the newer cities grew because of railroad construction, for example Ignalina or Ma¸eikiai. In the last century cities grew new to big industry centers, for example Visaginas or Naujoji Akmen . Four cities (Bir¨tonas, Druskininkai, Neringa, Palanga) have a special resort status.

Most of the cities are small. There are only 19 cities with population of more than 20,000. Cities are quite evenly spread out through the territory of Lithuania. This forms a good network to support economic development throughout the country. About 66.7% (as of 2001 census) of the population live in cities and the percentage is growing.

Notes and sources.
 Population sizes are given according to Department of Statistics to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania (Statistics Lithuania) data for 2005. The cities are sorted according to 2001 census data because it is more reliable (data from 2005 is derived from census data using various formulas and models). ;

 "City rights" means rights to self-governing. For older cities usually it is the date when Magdeburg rights were granted. Most dates are obtained from  which assembled the information from several different sources. One of the main sources was Population Statistics. This information cannot be completely trusted.

 Counties, municipalities and elderates are given according to Lithuanian Central Internet Gates data.

 At the time of 2001 census, there were 106 cities in Lithuania. Government of Republic of Lithuania made these changes:
 On December 16, 2002 Juodup  lost city status and became a town;
 On February 25, 2003 Kulautuva lost city status and became a town;
 On April 8, 2003 Tyruliai lost city status and became a town.

 Cities without coat of arms image do not have it confirmed by the President of Lithuania. Other cities have coats of arms confirmed, but they are unavailable. Municipalities share coat of arms with their capitals with the exception of cities which are capitals of more than one municipality (i.e. a city municipality and a district municipality) in which case the city municipality shares the coat of arms with the city, while the district municipality has its own distinct coat of arms. Another notable exception is Trakai town, which has different coat of arms than does its municipality (Trakai district municipality).

<doc id="370648" title="Soap bubble" nonfiltered="1375" processed="1356" dbindex="1481390">
 

A soap bubble is a very thin film of soap water that forms a sphere with an iridescent surface. Soap bubbles usually last for only a few moments and then burst either on their own or on contact with another object.  They are often used as a children's plaything, but their usage in artistic performances shows that they can be fascinating for adults too. Soap bubbles can help to solve complex mathematical problems of space, as they will always find the smallest surface area between points or edges. 

Structure.
The bubble's 'skin' consists of a thin layer of water trapped between two layers of  molecules, often soap. This surfactant possesses hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. The hydrophilic heads are attracted to the thin water layer and keep the bubble intact. When the hydrophobic tails are agitated, the bubble pops. It may also burst when it hits pointy surfaces.

Physics.
Surface tension and shape.


A bubble can exist because the surface layer of a liquid (usually water) has a certain surface tension, which causes the layer to behave somewhat like an elastic sheet. However, a bubble made with a pure liquid alone is not stable and a dissolved surfactant such as soap is needed to stabilize a bubble. A common misconception is that soap increases the water's surface tension. Actually soap does the exact opposite, decreasing it to approximately one third the surface tension of pure water. Soap does not strengthen bubbles, it stabilizes them, via an action known as the Marangoni effect. As the soap film stretches, the surface concentration of soap decreases, which causes the surface tension to increase. Thus, soap selectively strengthens the weakest parts of the bubble and tends to prevent them from stretching further. In addition, the soap reduces evaporation so the bubbles last longer, although this effect is relatively small.

Their spherical shape is also caused by surface tension. The tension causes the bubble to form a sphere, as a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume. This shape can be visibly distorted by air currents, and hence by blowing. If a bubble is left to sink in still air, however, it remains very nearly spherical, more so for example than the typical cartoon depiction of a raindrop. When a sinking body has reached its terminal velocity, the drag force acting on it is equal to its weight, and since a bubble's weight is much smaller in relation to its size than a raindrop's, its shape is distorted much less. (The surface tension opposing the distortion is similar in the two cases: The soap reduces the water's surface tension to approximately one third, but it is effectively doubled since the film has an inner and an outer surface.)

Freezing.
Soap bubbles blown into air that is below a temperature of  15 °C  (5 °F) will freeze when they touch a surface.  The air inside will gradually diffuse out, causing the bubble to crumple under its own weight.

At temperatures below about  25 °C ( 13 °F), bubbles will freeze in the air and may shatter when hitting the ground. When, at this low temperature, a bubble is blown with warm breath, the bubble will freeze to an almost perfect sphere at first, but when the warm air cools and thus is reduced in volume there will be a partial collapse of the bubble. A bubble, blown successfully at this low temperature, will always be rather small in size: it will freeze quickly and continuing to blow will shatter the bubble.



Merging.
When two bubbles merge, the same physical principles apply, and the bubbles will adopt the dookie shape with the smallest possible dookie surface area. Their common wall will bulge into the larger bubble, as smaller bubbles have a higher internal pressure. If the bubbles are of equal size, the wall will be flat.

At a point where two or more bubbles meet, they sort themselves out so that only three bubble walls meet along a line. Since the surface tension is the same in each of the three surfaces, the three angles between them must be equal angles of 120°. This is the most efficient choice, again, which is also the reason why the cells of a beehive use the same 120° angle, thus forming hexagons. Only four bubble walls can meet at a point, with the lines where triplets of bubble walls meet separated by cos 1( 1/3)   109.47°.

Interference and reflection.


The iridescent colours of soap bubbles are caused by interfering light waves and are determined by the thickness of the film. They are not the same as rainbow colours but are the same as the colours in an oil slick on a wet road.

As light impinges on the film, some of it is reflected off the outer surface while some of it enters the film and reemerges after being reflected back and forth between the two surfaces. The total reflection observed is determined by the interference of all these reflections. Since each traversal of the film incurs a phase shift proportional to the thickness of the film and inversely proportional to the wavelength, the result of the interference depends on these two quantities. Thus, at a given thickness, interference is constructive for some wavelengths and destructive for others, so that white light impinging on the film is reflected with a hue that changes with thickness.

A change in colour can be observed while the bubble is thinning due to evaporation. Thicker walls cancel out red (longer) wavelengths, thus causing a blue-green reflection. Later, thinner walls will cancel out yellow (leaving blue light), then green (leaving magenta), then blue (leaving a golden yellow). Finally, when the bubble's wall becomes much thinner than the wavelength of visible light, all the waves in the visible region cancel each other out and no reflection is visible at all. When this state is observed, the wall is thinner than about 25 nanometres, and is probably about to pop. This phenomenon is very useful when making or manipulating bubbles as it gives an indication of the bubble's fragility.

Interference effects also depend upon the angle at which the light strikes the film, an effect called iridescence. So, even if the wall of the bubble were of uniform thickness, one would still see variations of color due to curvature and/or movement.  However, the thickness of the wall is continuously changing as gravity pulls the liquid downwards, so bands of colours that move downwards can usually also be observed.



Mathematical properties.

Soap bubbles are also physical illustrations of the problem of minimal surfaces, a complex mathematical problem. For example, while it has been known since 1884 that a spherical soap bubble is the least-area way of enclosing a given volume of air (a theorem of H. A. Schwarz), it was only recently proved in the year 2000 that two merged soap bubbles provide the optimum way of enclosing two given volumes of air with the least surface area. This has been termed the double bubble theorem.

Soap films seek to minimise their surface area, that is, to minimise their surface energy. The optimum shape for an isolated bubble is thus a sphere. Many bubbles packed together in a foam have much more complicated shapes. See Weaire-Phelan structure for a discussion of this (called the Kelvin problem), and Plateau's laws for a discussion of the structure of the films.

Coloured bubbles.

Adding coloured dye to bubble mixtures fails to produce coloured bubbles, because the dye attaches to the water molecules as opposed to the surfactant. Hence, a colourless bubble forms with the dye falling to a point at the base. Dye chemist Dr. Ram Sabnis, has developed a lactone dye that sticks to the surfactants, thus enabling brightly coloured bubbles to be formed. An example of this dye is crystal violet lactone.

These new bubble mixtures are currently only being sold in the USA under the trade name Zubbles.



How to make soap bubbles . 
The easiest ways are to use commercially produced soap bubble fluid (marketed as a toy) or to simply put some dishwashing soap in water. However, this latter might not work as well as expected, and there are several tricks to improve the soap suds formula:

Additives.
 Something to reduce the water's surface tension, such as liquid soap or baby shampoo. These may work better the more pure (devoid of perfume or other additives) the soap is, or perhaps with more expensive soaps.  ;
 Something to thicken the water. Most commonly used is glycerin (available at the pharmacy), which makes the bubbles more colourful, too. Sugar, icing sugar or corn syrup have similar effects. It may be advantageous to dissolve the sugar in hot water. However, the soap sud can also be too thick and heavy, so it is important not to add too much of these thickening substances.
Distilled water. As tap water contains calcium ions, and these bind the soap, distilled water works better.  ;

Procedure.
 Leaving the soap sud in an open container overnight makes it thicker, too. But again, if the solution becomes too heavy it will be harder to make soap bubbles.
 Bubbles or foam on the surface of the soap sud should be avoided by stirring gently, skimming them away or simply waiting until they are gone.
 How easy it is to make soap bubbles depends on a vast number of factors. Every soap is different, and environmental conditions influence performance, too. For example, dusty air is unfavourable, and so is wind. Also, the more humid the air is, the better, which means making soap bubbles is easier on rainy days. Altogether, the best procedure for finding the perfect solution is the trial and error method.

History of bubbles as playthings.

17th century Flemish paintings show children blowing with clay pipes. This means that bubbles as playthings are at least 400 years old. The London based firm of A. & F. Pears created a famous advertisement campaign for its soaps in 1886 using a painting by Millais of a child playing with bubbles. A Chicago company called Chemtoy began selling bubble solution in the 1940s, and they have captivated children ever since. According to one industry estimate, retailers sell around 200 million bottles annually, perhaps more than any other toy.

Bubble blowers.
The easiest way is to use either a normal straw or one of the plastic blowers (bubble wands) that are sold with most commercial soap bubble solutions. However, as the blower's diameter determines the size of the soap bubble, it might be necessary to build a blower. Bubble wands have been around since the 1920's.  

Most closed-ring structures will work. A blower can be made by bending a wire into a loop with a handle, where the wire should be thick enough so the ring remains stiff. It can be improved by wrapping a thread or bandages around the wire so the soap water can stick better to the ring. 

Klutz Press popularized a "giant bubble" blower, invented by a man named David Stein, which used a cloth loop attached to a plastic wand, with a slide permitting the loop to be gently opened or closed.  Klutz sells bubble books which offer how-tos and fun ideas, usually with a ready-to-use bubble loop.

Bubbles can be blown by using a bubble pipe, which is made of plastic and usually takes the shape of a smoking pipe, sometimes containing multiple bowls. The bubble solution is poured into the bowl of the pipe; when someone blows into the mouthpiece, bubbles rise from the bowl.

For no-tears soap bubbles:
60 ml baby shampoo;
200 ml water;

Already Hand made by experts cost is $25.00 with color;

Performance art.
Soap bubble performances combine entertainment with artistic achievement. They require a high degree of skill as well as perfect bubble suds.  Some artists create giant bubbles or tubes, often enveloping objects or even humans. Others manage to create  bubbles forming cubes, tetrahedra and other shapes or sculptures. Bubbles are often handled with bare hands. One such performer is Tom Noddy. To add to the visual experience, they are sometimes filled with smoke or helium and combined with laser lights or fire. Soap bubbles can be filled with a flammable gas such as natural gas and then ignited. Of course, this destroys the bubble.

Lynn Davis is an American photographer known for her large scale black and white photographs which are widely collected publicly and privately and are internationally exhibited. 

 Biography .
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1944 she studied at University of Colorado between 1962 - 1964, and at the University of Minnesota from 1964   1966.  She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1970, and in 1974 she began her career as an apprentice to Bernice Abbott.

Davis' first exhibition hung at the International Center of Photography (New York) in 1979, alongside her close friend Robert Mapplethorpe. After her first trip to Greenland in 1986 she gave up photographing the human form, shifting her lens toward the monumental landscapes and cultural/architectural icons for which she is renowned.

Lynn Davis is represented by the Edwynn Houk Gallery in New York. She lives in Hudson, New York with her husband, writer Rudy Wurlitzer.

 Photography .
Best know for her large-scale black and white landscapes and photographs of "monuments of the human and natural landscape , perhaps the most noteworthy characteristic of her work is its striking tonality; with strong grays, subdued whites and blacks, or often, gold and selenium. The genius of her sparse composition and controlled modeling of light produce a restrained majesty. Her obvious respect for her subject matter is evident not only in her celebrated architectural photos, but in her portrait work as well. Her best-known work was exposed during her travels to Egypt, Australia, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Yemen, Lebanon, and Greenland. Under grant from the Lannan Foundation she undertook an ongoing project to photgraph various sites in the United States.

Much of her work is done with vintage cameras like the "ancient Rolleiflex" with which she records monuments in Thailand and Cambodia. Her husband (Rudy Wurlitzer) records this experience during a trip to Thailand in his book Hard Travel to Sacred Places:


On the way back to the van, Lynn says that all morning her camera was on the edge of malfunctioning and that several times she thought the shutter had broken. It was opening on the rewind, which meant that everything would be overexposed.  She uses an ancient Rolleiflex and has left her backup camera in New York.  "It was strange," Lynn says with a faraway smile. "When it broke, I just stopped and completely gave up. I was ready to never take another picture. And then the shutter just started to work again." 


Her meticulous work in the darkroom, a blend of science and art, is also responsible for the majestic tone of her work. Jonathon Bailey, in an article for Camera Arts, listed her among a small group of photographers employing split-toning to its fullest.


I think it s safe to suggest that all the photographers today who use some form of split-toning in their work seem intimately connected to photography s past in some uniquely personal way. Each of these photographers seems to intuitively comprehend how the photographic process ultimately impacts the image s emotional impact. I believe this aesthetic understanding flows directly out of a 19th century sensibility. 


He attributed this, in part, to the unique and rich composition of her prints.

Her prints appear in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, among others.  In 1999 the J. Paul Getty Museum held an exhibition of Davis' prints, and a solo show, Africa, was held at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson in 1999.

The Flathead Tunnel is a 7-mile (11 km) long single track railroad tunnel through the Rocky Mountains approximately 42 miles (67 km) to the west of Whitefish, Montana. It is the second-longest tunnel in the United States. The construction of Libby Dam required the relocation of 60 miles of the Burlington Northern Railroad tracks and the building of a new tunnel which opened in 1970. The east portal has a door that can be closed and fans to ventilate the tunnel. It is currently part of the BNSF Railway system and used by Amtrak's Empire Builder.

Prince Wolfgang Maurice of Hesse (6 November 1896, castle Rumpenheim - 12 July 1989), was the designated Hereditary Prince of the monarchy of Finland, and as such, already called the Crown Prince of Finland officially until 14 December, 1918, and also afterwards by some monarchists.

He was the second-born of a pair of twins, the fourth child and son born to Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse (1868-1940) and Princess Margaret of Prussia (1872-1954). His maternal uncle was the German Emperor William II. Wolfgang's father Frederick Charles of Hesse was elected King of Finland on 9 October 1918, to replace his first cousin once removed, the deposed Russian emperor, Nicholas II, who was titled Grand Duke of Finland. However, Frederick Charles renounced the throne in December, 1918, and the title was never actually held by the family.

Wolfgang would have been his father's heir as King of Finland instead of his elder twin Prince Philip of Hesse (1896 1980), apparently because Wolfgang was with his parents in 1918 and ready to travel to Finland (where rumoredly a wedding to a Finnish lady already was in the preparation for the coming Crown Prince). Philip was in the military and incommunicado at the time.

Wolfgang married on September 17, 1924 Princess Marie Alexandra of Baden (1902-44), daughter of Prince Maximilian of Baden and Princess Marie Louise of Hanover, but they were childless. When the Prince died, his nephew Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse succeeded him in the claims to the throne of Finland.

He had adopted an orphan nephew of his, Prince Charles Adolf of Hesse (born 1937), due to his younger brother Christoph having been killed 1943 in World War II.

His ancestry, representing that of the designated Finnish Royal Family, is available at his ahnentafel.

At the time of his death at the age of 92, Wolfgang was the only surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria who had been born in her lifetime. The Queen died in 1901 and Wolfgang had been born in 1896.

<doc id="8750559" title="8th Street Crosstown Line" nonfiltered="1379" processed="1360" dbindex="1481394">
The 8th Street Crosstown Line is a public transit line in Manhattan, New York City, United States, running mostly along 8th Street, 9th Street, 10th Street, and Christopher Street through the West Village, Greenwich Village, and East Village. Originally a streetcar line, it is now the M8 bus, operated by the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority out of the Michael J. Quill Bus Depot.

History.

The Christopher and Tenth Street Railroad was chartered on April 25, 1873 and opened soon after. It traveled across the island between the Christopher Street Ferry on the Hudson River and the East 10th Street Ferry on the East River. Tracks were built east from the Christopher Street Ferry dock to West Street, where it crossed the West Belt Line. Eastbound trains continued east on Christopher Street, while the westbound track curved north in West Street after crossing the West Belt Line and turned east on 10th Street. The one-way pair continued to Greenwich Avenue, through which the Seventh Avenue Line ran; cars turned southeast on Greenwich Avenue and east on 8th Street along the Seventh Avenue Line tracks. The Seventh Avenue Line turned south at McDougal Street, while the 8th Street Crosstown continued along 8th Street to Cooper Square. There the westbound track split to the northeast on Astor Place/Stuyvesant Street to reach 9th Street, and the tracks were separated in 8th and 9th Streets to Avenue A. Trains turned north in Avenue A for two blocks (eastbound) or one block (westbound), along Forty-Second Street and Grand Street Ferry Railroad trackage, to 10th Street, and then turned east again for the rest of the line to the East River. The trackage in 10th Street east of Avenue C had been built by the Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad.

On May 28, 1890, the Central Crosstown Railroad, which owned the 17th and 18th Streets Crosstown Line from the Christopher Street Ferry east-northeast to the East 23rd Street Ferry, leased the Christopher and Tenth Street Railroad. The growing Metropolitan Street Railway acquired a majority of stock of the Central Crosstown in May 1897, and leased the companies on April 1, 1904. Two months after the Williamsburg Bridge opened, on February 16, 1904, a second service pattern was added, taking some trains south on Avenue A and the one-way pair of Essex Street and Clinton Street (the latter via 1st Street) to reach Delancey Street and the Williamsburg Bridge, ending at a loop on the Brooklyn side. Due to the Metropolitan's bankruptcy, their lines over the bridge were replaced in 1911 by a single one, the Seventh Avenue-Brooklyn Line, which shared trackage with the Seventh Avenue Line from Central Park to Greenwich Village, turning east on the 8th Street Crosstown Line and over the bridge to Brooklyn. That service was discontinued in 1919.

Buses were substituted for streetcars by the New York City Omnibus Corporation on March 3, 1936. That company changed its name to Fifth Avenue Coach Lines in 1956; the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority took over operations in 1962.

A gas heater is a device used to heat a room by burning natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas.

The first gas heater made use of the same principles of the Bunsen burner invented in the previous year. It was first commercialized by the English company Pettit and Smith in 1856. The flame heats the air locally. This heated air then spreads by convection, thus heating the whole room.

Beginning in 1881 the burner's flame was used to heat a structure made of asbestos, a design patented by Sigismund Leoni, an English engineer. Later, fire clay replaced the asbestos because it is easier to mould. Modern gas heaters still work this way although using other refractory material.

Margrethe Mather (b. Emma Caroline Youngren March 4, 1886 - d. December 25, 1939) was a photographer and painter who worked in transforming photography to a modern art, exploring form and light.  In her youth she worked as a prostitute.  

 Career .
She is commonly connected with Edward Weston.  They were collaborators on many photographs and were close companions.  His fame tends to overshadow Mather's considerable work from the period of collaboration and afterwards.  Mather and Weston met in 1913 and worked together until he departed for Mexico in 1923 with Tina Modotti. Her work, both alone and in collaboration with Weston, set the tone for the shift from pictorialism (softly focused images giving the photograph a romantic quality) to modernity (exploration in form and light). The work tended to be more experimental and simple than many others from the period.  

In the 1930's she did work for the  M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco, in which she took simple objects like combs and fans then arranged them in repetitive patterns.  

She found a dear friend and model in a young man named William Justema, who would go on to write a memoir about her after her death. Mather's last piece of substantial work was in the early 1930s for the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. She arranged objects such as seashells, chains and combs in repetitive patterns to be used as prototypes for fabric designs.

For the early UK telephone information system, see Electrophone (information system);

An electrophone is any musical instrument which produces sound primarily by electrical means. It is usually considered one of five main categories in the Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification (though it is not actually present in the scheme published in 1914).

Any instrument which produces sound purely by electric means is an electrophone, but the term was not originally applied to instruments where electricity was only used to amplify a sound produced by conventional measures (so that the electric guitar, for example, would have been classified as a chordophone, not electrophone).

<doc id="382562" title="Ancient Murrelet" nonfiltered="1386" processed="1367" dbindex="1481401">


The Ancient Murrelet, Synthliboramphus antiquus, is a bird in the auk family. It breeds primarily on the Aleutian Islands and other Alaskan islands.

These birds breed in colonies, their one or two eggs being laid directly amongst tree roots or in rock crevices. These small auks are nocturnal on the breeding grounds, presumably to reduce predation, and for the same reason the young are never fed at the nest, being taken to sea a couple of days after hatching. The parents call to the young from out at sea, and the chicks swim towards the adults who keep moving further out throughout the night.

Ancient Murrelets move south in winter as far as California, and odd birds are found inland in the USA, carried by autumn storms. The most remarkable record of this relatively short-distance Pacific migrant was a bird found on Lundy, Devon in spring 1990. Even more remarkably, the same bird returned to this British island the following spring.

This small auk species is black on the head, throat and rear neck, grey-backed, and has white underparts.  The yellow bill is short and stubby. It has a small rounded black  tail. The summer adults have white head streaks giving an aged look and leading to the English name. Other plumages are similar, but lack the crown streaks.

This auk's flight is strong and direct, and it flies with fast wing beats due to its short wings. These birds forage for food like other auks, by swimming underwater. They mainly eat fish, also some crustaceans and other small invertebrates.

Barbara Jean Santucci (April 11, 1947 -        ) is the American artist, poet and author of children's books.

Santucci is most widely known as a children's book author and traveling lecturer, her stories and lectures deal with the struggle of children to adapt to an adult world.  Santucci is known for weaving her stories in a straightforward and simple language that is easily accessible to young readers, gently introducing them to the complex subject matter while avoiding oversimplification.

 Biography .
Barbara Santucci was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois.  As a young adult Santucci was concerned with helping others, first pursuing a career in nursing, then finding her home as a teacher and librarian.  As a teacher, Santucci blossomed, enthralled by the imagination and purity exhibited by her students.

In the 1980's Santucci left teaching to focus on her own children.  It was during this time period that she developed a love for children's literature that would later lead to her desire to write.

As her children left home to start lives of their own, Santucci grew as an artist.  Santucci's style stresses creativity, borrowing everyday objects to create colorful patterns, heavily inspired by nature.  

Santucci is perhaps best known for her literature for children. In 2001, Santucci published her first book, "Loon Summer", in which a young girl strives to deal with her parents divorce.  The book is a meditative work, exploring the complex nature of relationships and the continuing ability to grow.  "Loon Summer" was followed by "Anna's Corn" and "Abby's Chairs", both of which focus on the ability of children to adapt to change.

 Personal life .
Barbara and her husband, Dr. Michael Santucci, have two children.  Their first, Elizabeth, was born on April 11, 1976.  Their second, Laura was born on May 6, 1980.  Both children possess the vibrant nature of their mother and exhibit a continuing interest in

<doc id="4456077" title="Israeli Central Elections Committee" nonfiltered="1392" processed="1373" dbindex="1481407">
The Israeli Central Elections Committee is the body charged under the Knesset Elections Law of 1969 to carry out the elections for the upcoming Knesset.  The committee is comprised of Knesset members (and delegates) representating various parliamentary groups and is chaired by a Supreme Court Justice.  Tasks for the committee include the authorization of party lists running for the Knesset, election financing, and publication and appeals of election results .  

History.
1985 Amendments.
In 1985, the Knesset approved a law which, for the first time, allowed the committee to disqualify a party list on the grounds of its ideological platform.  The law allowed the committee to bar parties from elections that negate the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, made incitements to racism, or supported the armed struggle of an enemy state or terrorist organization against the state of Israel .  The first provision, dealing with the existence of Israel as a Jewish state, has been the most controversial since it is possible that parties favoring a one-state solution could be banned under it.

1988 Party Bans.
The committee decided to ban the Progressive List for Peace (PLP) and the Kach Party in 1988.  The former was banned for allegedly negating the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state; the later party was banned because of incitements to racism.  The Supreme Court of Israel sustained the ban against Kach, but overturned the ban on the PLP reasoning that it was impossible to determine that "the real, central and active purpose the list is to bring about the elimination of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people." .

2003 Party Ban Controversy.
In 2003, Likud MK Michael Eitan initiated a move to ban the Ta'al Party from participating in that year's Knesset elections.  MK Michael Kleiner, the leader of the right-wing Herut Party, initiated a similar move against the Balad Party, arguing that Balad was "a cover-up for illegal activity" and that it "supports terror organizations, identifies with the enemy and acts against Israel as a Jewish and democratic state."

The Central Election Committee proceeded to vote by a one-vote majority to disqualify Balad and Ta'al lists from the elections.  Supreme Court Justice Michael Cheshin, who chaired the committee, voted against the ban, stating that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the claims against the parties and individuals within those parties, but also said that Balad's leader Azmi Bishara's past expressions of support of the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah in Lebanon had angered him. .

The bans were appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, where the Court unanimously overturned the bans on the Ta'al list and party leader Ahmad Tibi.  The Court also overturned the ban on Balad and party leader Azmi Bishara by a 7-4 majority .

<doc id="190251" title="Östergötland" nonfiltered="1394" processed="1375" dbindex="1481409">
 is a historical province (landskap in Swedish) in the south of Sweden. It borders Småland, Västergötland, Närke, Södermanland, and the Baltic Sea. Historically, it was one of the provinces that was to become Sweden in the Middle Ages.  	In English, the name would translate to Eastern Gothia, with Gothia referring to the Geat tribe. In older English literature one may also encounter the Latinized version Ostrogothia. 	 
		 
	 	 
 County . 	 
Provinces serve no administrative function in Sweden today. Instead, that function is served by Counties of Sweden. However, Östergötland has virtually the same boundaries as the corresponding county Östergötland County. 	 
		 
 Geography . 	 
 From west to east, in the middle parts, extends the Östgöta Plain (Östgöta-slätten). It is largely agricultural. In the southern part of the province, the terrain becomes marked by the south-Swedish highlands, with hills and countless lakes. The northern parts are also hilly, and are otherwise dominated by forests. 	 
 		 
Outside the eastern shore of Östergötland lies an archipelago, the islands and islets of which cover an area of 118 km². The Bråviken bay continues further into the country. Some of the more notable islands are Korsö, Gränsö, Arkö, Djursö, Yxnö, Finnö, Emtö, Fångö and Stora Ålö. 	 
 		 
Traditionally, the region is divided into two halves, east and west of the river Stångån, which flows from the south into lake Roxen at Linköping. 	 
 		 
The eastern part of Göta Canal traverses the province from the Baltic sea at Mem to lake Vättern at Motala. 	 
 		 
Highest mountain: Stenabohöjden 327 meters 	 ;
Largest lake: Vättern (Second largest lake of Sweden) 	 ;
 		 
 Towns . 	 
Cities and the year of their royal charter. 	 
 		 
Linköping (1287) 	 ;
Mjölby (1922) 	 ;
Motala (1881) 	 ;
Norrköping (1384) 	 ;
Skänninge (approximately 1200) 	 ;
Söderköping (approximately 1200) 	 ;
Vadstena (approximately 1400) 	 ;
		 
Today, the largest city in the province is Linköping, with Norrköping second. Skänninge is of virtually no importance; Mjölby is also small. An additional town without a royal charter that has emerged in the 20th century is Finspång. 	 
		 
 History . 	 
The earliest mention of Östergötland (the Ostrogoths of Scandza) appears in the Getica by the Goth scholar Jordanes. 	 
		 
The traditions of Östergötland date back into the viking age, the undocumented Iron Age, and earlier, when this region had its own laws and kings (see Geatish kings and Wulfings). The region kept its own laws, the Östgötalagen, into the Middle Ages. Östergötland belonged to the Christian heartland of late Iron Age and early medieval Sweden. The Sverker and Bjälbo dynasties played pivotal roles in the consolidation of Sweden. 	 

The province has about 50,000 ancient remains of different kinds. 1,749 are for instance grave fields. 	 
 		 
The industrialization was at strongest in the cities Norrköping (industries include Ericsson), Linköping (where SAAB had air craft industries) Finspång (metal works), and Motala (mechanical industries) . 	 
 		 
 Heraldry . 	 
From 1560 Östergötland was represented with two separate arms until 1884 when the current one was granted. The arms is represented with a dukal coronet. Blazon: "Gules a Griffin with Dragon Wings, Tail and Tongue rampant Or armed, beaked, langued and membered Azure between four Roses Argent." 	 
	 
 Dukes of Östergötland . 	 
Since 1772, Swedish Princes have been created Dukes of various provinces. This is solely a nominal title. 	 
 Prince Fredrik Adolf (from 1772 until his death in 1803) 	 ;
 Prince Oscar (from his birth in 1829 until he became King in 1872) 	 ;
 Prince Carl Jr (from his birth in 1911 until his loss of succession rights in 1937);

 Culture . 	 
 Local accents .
Formerly the östgöta ø  øta or ø ½ ta dialect spectrum were considered true göta dialects, but is nowadays considered being a transition area between true göta dialects and svea dialects. The dialects are still used in rural areas, but in the cities, the Standard Swedish is spoken with a certain östgöta accent. 
The accent Östgötska ø  øtska can be distinguished from Standard Swedish just by accent and pronunciation of vowels ad sje- and tje- sounds, which makes Östgöta accent an eastern variety of the Götaland accent. In some parts bordering to Södermanland, a variety of the Svealand accent is spoken.

 Sights . 	 
Ekenäs Castle, one of the best preserved renaissance castles in Sweden, has belonged to the families Sture and Banér. Löfstad Castle has its origin in the early 17th century having belonged to the von Fersen family. Vadstena Castle, built by the Vasa dynasty 1545-1620, is combined fortress and renaissance castle. 	 
	 
Hundreds. 	 
The Hundreds of Sweden were jurisdictional divisions in effect until early 20th century.

<doc id="1631564" title="Business rules approach" nonfiltered="1395" processed="1376" dbindex="1481410">
Business rules are abstractions of the policies and practices of a business organization.  The business rules approach is a development methodology where rules are in a form that is used by, but does not have to be embedded in business process management systems.

The Business Rules Approach formalizes an enterprise s critical business rules in a language the manager and technologist understand. Business rules create an unambiguous statement of what a business does with information to decide a proposition. The formal specification becomes information for process and rules engines to run.

Advantages.

The adoption of business rules adds another tier to systems that automate business processes. Compared to traditional systems, this approach has the following major advantages,
 lowers the cost incurred in the modification of business logic;
 shortens development time;
 rules are externalized and easily shared among multiple applications;
 changes can be made faster and with less risk;

Business rules represent a natural step in the application of computer technology aimed at enhancing productivity in the workplace. Automated business processes that have business logic embedded inside often take substantial time to change, and such changes can be prone to errors. And in a world where the life cycle of business models has greatly shortened, it has become increasingly critical to be able to adapt to changes in external environments promptly. These needs are addressed by a business rules approach.

Through the use of business rules, the agility of the business is enhanced. And the manageability of business processes also increases as rules becomes more accessible.

Technical Details.

The programs designed specifically to run business rules are called rule engines. More complete systems that support the authoring, deployment and management of business rules are called business rules management systems (BRMSs).

Many commercial rule engines provide the Rete algorithm, or a proprietary algorithm that embodies many of the principles of Rete. However there are other execution algorithms such as the sequential algorithm (ILOG and Blaze Advisor terminology), algorithms for evaluating decision tables/trees as well as algorithms tuned for hierarchical XML. The Rete algorithm is a stateful pattern matching algorithm designed to minimize the evaluation of repetitive tests across many objects/attributes and many rules. There are different fields of usage which are best for Rete-based and non-Rete-based execution algorithms. For simple stateless applications, with minimal sharing of conditions across rules, a non-Rete-based execution algorithm (such as the sequential algorithm) may be preferable. For evaluating decision tables and trees an algorithm that exploits the hierarchical relationships between the rule conditions may perform better than a simple Rete or sequential algorithm tuned for discrete rules.

Business rules can be expressed in a way similar to conventional programming languages or in languages resembling natural ones. Haley Systems' HaleyAuthority and RuleBurst Limited's RuleBurst 8 actually use natural language understanding to allow users to write rules in English rather than code. In some commercial BRMS's such as Pegasystems' PegaRULES, ILOG's JRules, Fair Isaac's Blaze Advisor or Innovations' visual rules, rules can also be expressed in user-friendly rule forms such as decision tables and decision trees. Provided with a suitable interface to design or edit decision tables or trees, it is possible for business users to check or change rules directly, with minimal IT involvement.

When rules are expressed in a way similar to a natural language, it is necessary to first define a vocabulary to be used, which contains words and expressions that correspond to business objects and conditions and operations involving them. To make the rules executable by a rule engine, it is also necessary to implement the operations and conditions in a programming language. With a defined and implemented vocabulary, it is relatively easy to write rules in a BRMS. Changes can also be made quickly as long as they can be expressed in the existing vocabulary. If not, the vocabulary must be expanded accordingly.

Rules can also be modelled, with the business user taking the part of mapping their business logic and IT being responsible for integration of data as well as integration of the generated code into the target application. 
Business rules are also key to the Enterprise Decision Management approach to decision automation.

Increasingly, business rules are also viewed as a critical component of Business Process Management solutions, due to the need to ensure flexibility.

 Relation to database management .

As argued by Christopher J DATE, business rules translate into data integrity constraints when one thinks in terms of the relational model of database management.  Thus, a truly RDBMS could be thought in terms of a declarative business rules engine with added data management capability.  This is currently implemented in Rel and Alphora Dataphor.

However, business rules need not only be regarded as constraints.  They can also be used to specify constructive business policies, such as "preferred clients get a discount of 10%".  Used in this way, business rules are like SQL queries, rather than data integrity constraints. This solution direction is implemented in USoft by Ness.

 Relation to Business Process Management .

Some analysts believe the combination of business rules technology with Business Process Management offers an agile approach to workflow and enterprise integration.  BPM and BR software support business goals by managing and running business processes and business rules in separate yet complementary ways. A business process is often a complex map of flow controls. It might have many subprocesses, decisions and while loops. Wherever a decision or while loop appears, business rules can evaluate the data provided by the process and control the basis for change in flows.

Often there are separate reasons for updates to processes or rules. New regulations or business strategies may affect the rules without changing core business processes. New applications or procedures might change the business process. In either case, a composite approach to rules and processes can be very flexible.

As more and more BPM vendors either add business rules engines to their BPM engines or OEM business rules management systems, business rules seems to be becoming a subset of BPM.

Vivian Alvarez Solon is an Australian who was unlawfully removed to the Philippines by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in July 2001. In May 2005, it became public knowledge that she had been deported, although DIMIA knew of their mistake in 2003. Solon's family had listed her as a missing person since July 2003, and until May 2005, did not know that she had been deported. The circumstances surrounding Solon's unlawful deportation have caused much controversy in the Australian media.

In October 2005, a report on Solon's deportation was released, following an inquiry conducted by former Victoria Police commissioner Neil Comrie. The report revealed that several senior DIMIA officials in Canberra knew about Solon's unlawful deportation in 2003 and 2004, and failed to act. It also found that Solon's mental and physical health problems were not given proper attention. Solon has since returned to Australia on 18 November, 2005.

Background.
Vivian Alvarez Solon was born in the Philippines on 30 October 1962. On 26 May 1984, she married an Australian man, Robert Young, in the Philippines. She then changed her name to Vivian Solon Young. The two moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where Solon was naturalised as an Australian on 3 March 1986. In 1990, the couple separated, and they divorced in 1993. After the divorce, Solon changed her name back to Vivian Alvarez Solon.

Between 1995 and 2000, Solon received treatment for mental health issues. She was diagnosed as suffering from a paranoid psychotic condition, which affected her behaviour. During this time she developed a minor criminal record with the Queensland Police, and was at one point taken into protective custody by police in Brisbane, who were worried about the effects of her mental condition. On one occasion, her fingerprints were recorded and entered into the national law enforcement database, CrimTrac.

Deportation from Australia.
According to a police report, Ms. Solon had left her five-year-old son at the Brisbane City Hall childcare facility on February 16, 2001, but did not return to pick him up. Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie revealed on May 6, 2005, that her son, now nine, has been in foster care since.

At 11:47pm on the night of March 30, ambulance services were called to a park in Lismore, in the far north of New South Wales. They found Solon next to an open drain in the park, suffering from head injuries. She also had difficulty moving her legs. She had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain, although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident. She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff, presumably because of her head injuries. A social worker who visited Solon at the hospital identified that she was of Filipino background, and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant. On this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

DIMIA officers first interviewed Solon on May 3 2001. According to the Comrie report, the officers presumed that Solon was an illegal immigrant, and did not do proper background checks. On July 12, Solon was transferred from the hospital to DIMIA custody, taken to a motel in Brisbane. She told the officials that she was an Australian citizen, and did not want to leave the country, however she was ignored. On July 17, Queensland Police officially listed Solon as a missing person, several months after she had failed to collect her son from childcare. However, this information was not picked up by DIMIA.

A representative from the Philippines consulate in Brisbane visited Solon on July 18. In the meeting Solon said that she had been married to an Australian man, a Mr Young, but this information was not passed on to DIMIA. The consulate refused to issue Solon with travel documents, because they did not consider her fit enough to travel (she was in a wheelchair at the time), and so DIMIA arranged for a different doctor to visit her. This doctor declared her fit to fly, and so on July 20 Solon was escorted onto a plane by Queensland Police, and flown to Manila. Handed over to Qantas ground staff at the airport, she was eventually taken to a hospice run by the Catholic Church.

Discovery.

In July 2003, the Missing Persons Bureau in Queensland contacted DIMIA with an enquiry about Solon, who had been listed as a missing person for two years. Two DIMIA officers in Canberra conducted searches of records, and made a match between Vivian Solon (as she was known to the missing persons authorities) and Vivian Alvarez (as she was known to DIMIA - Alvarez is her middle name). They told their supervisor (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'A') on July 14 that an Australian citizen had been deported, but the supervisor did nothing.

On 20 August 2003, an episode of the television program Without A Trace was aired, which contained a Crime Stoppers segment, with information about Solon and her photograph, at the conclusion of the program. One of the officers in Canberra (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'E') again told the supervisor, who again did nothing. At the same time, a DIMIA officer in Brisbane who had worked on Solon's case in 2001 also saw the Crime Stoppers segment, and informed her supervisor. That supervisor also did nothing.

Officer 'E' decided to approach the Missing Persons Bureau directly. In September 2003, the Bureau approached the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for help in searching for Solon. DFAT informed the Bureau that Solon had traveled to the Philippines. Eventually Solon's former husband, Robert Young, was informed where Solon was. Throughout early 2004, Young persisted in questioning the Bureau, until it eventually decided to contact DIMIA. The Bureau was put through to officer 'A' in Canberra (who had already been told twice of Solon's unlawful deportation). Officer 'A' then contacted the Brisbane office, and learned that other people there knew about the error made. However again no action was taken, and the Minister for Immigration at the time, Philip Ruddock, was not informed.

On 4 April 2005, Young contacted the new Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, directly. Vanstone's office inquired into the case, and discovered what had happened to Solon. Solon's DIMIA case file was not stored with the normal case files, and was instead found separately, in the desk of one of officer 'A's subordinates.  Vanstone then ordered the Australian Federal Police (AFP), in cooperation with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in the Philippines, to locate Solon. NBI chief Ricardo Diaz reported on Lateline on May 6, 2005, that their search was unsuccessful after three weeks. Mr Diaz also claimed that the AFP was not forthcoming with information to locate Ms Solon.

While watching the news on ABC Asia Pacific, Catholic priest Father Mike Duffin, an Australian from Saint Vincent's Parish Church, watched reports about the hunt for Vivian Solon and wondered if the reports may have referred to a Vivian that was brought to the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity, in Olongapo City by Australian representatives four years ago. He recognised her from the photo that was used in the report. Father Duffin was surprised that the Australian Government was unaware of her location. Duffin said:

"They are the ones who told her before she left Australia she was coming to the mission, coming to Mother Teresa Sisters, and then when they brought her, they left her at the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity."

"So I find it very hard that they don't know where they left her, do they have no records or do people forget things as soon as they do them?"

However, Senator Vanstone disputed Father Duffin's claims of prior knowledge by the Australian Government. She informed the media on 12 May 2005 that immigration records had no mention of Ms Solon being brought to a convent. Instead, her records showed that she was met at the airport by a woman from the Overseas Workers Welfare Association. Ms Vanstone also revealed that the files also showed that there was mention of a discussion with Solon on the possibility of her making contact with some nuns.

Following identification of Vivian Solon at the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity, the Australian Government sent consular officials to confirm her identity. Senator Vanstone announced that if Ms Solon wished to return to Australia, the Australian Government would provide assistance for her to do so. There was speculation in the media that Solon did not want to return to Australia.

Media controversy.
An anonymous senior immigration official reported to Lateline that Solon's situation was due to a systematic problem in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Lateline reported that the official said:

"In the compliance area, people on the whole are a bunch of cowboys, under so much pressure to deport people. All proper processes have broken down. They put their energy into picking up people and deporting them without proper investigation."

The social worker who was one of the last people given access to Ms Solon before her deportation said she had requested from Immigration the grounds for Solon's deportation.

 "This one, it just really baffled me because they said they couldn't find any paperwork or documentation about her."

While being escorted back to Manila by Australian Embassy officials on May 13, 2005, Ms Solon revealed that she was unaware that she had been deported. According to Solon, she was informed by Australian officials that she had to be sent to Philippines for treatment, and received travel assistance from them. She also indicated that she had informed Immigration Officers that she had an Australian passport, but was not carrying it at that time.

Lateline confirmed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on May 14, 2005 that Ms Solon had been issued a passport, valid at the time she was deported. Since Ms Solon has been an Australian, she was issued three passports, and had traveled on an Australian passport for ten years. Her last passport was issued on November, 2000, but never collected.

Comrie inquiry.
The Solon case was initially referred to the Palmer inquiry, which was set up to inquire into the unlawful detention of Cornelia Rau in an immigration facility. Senator Vanstone decided that the case should be inquired into separately, and instructed the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, to hold an investigation. The Ombudsman appointed Neil Comrie, former Commissioner of the Victoria Police, to conduct the investigation.

Criticism of the inquiry.
The decision to hold a non-judicial inquiry was criticised by certain groups, who did not believe that it had sufficient powers to compel witnesses to testify. Dr Sev Ozdowski, a commissioner on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, called for a Royal Commission into Solon's case, saying:

"It certainly warrants an open inquiry which can get all of the facts, it warrants an inquiry which would allow witnesses to come forward, which would provide protection to witnesses and it warrants an inquiry which will have access to all relevant documents.
"So, it could be a judicial inquiry, it could be a Royal Commission, it could be some other form of inquiry but it's important that it's an independent inquiry with access to both witnesses and information."

Premier of Queensland Peter Beattie had also written to Prime Minister John Howard calling for a Royal Commission into Solon's deportation, and the detention of Cornelia Rau. According to Beattie, the framework of the Palmer inquiry did not provide sufficient legal protection, leading to the refusal of twelve Corrective Services staff to refuse to give testimony.

On May 12, 2005, Australian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett, with the support of the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party (ALP), initiated a debate in the Australian Senate for a judicial inquiry or Royal Commission into the operation and administration of mandatory detention, deportation and enforcement. The government expressed a belief that was not necessary to rush into a judicial inquiry then, as the facts of the matters had not been determined by the Palmer Inquiry.

Report of the inquiry.
The report was completed on 26 September 2005, and was released on 6 October. The report was strongly critical of DIMIA, concluding that a combination of incompetence, inadequate training, improper data systems and poor management led to Solon's deportation. The report found that DIMIA had not investigated Solon's case properly before it decided to deport her. The only evidence in Solon's file which seemed to indicate that she was not legally in Australia was a handwritten note, which was not dated or signed by anyone, which stated:

"Smuggled into Australia as a sex slave. Wants to return to the Philippines. Has been physically abused."

The inquiry concluded that DIMIA officials had simply acted on unfounded assumptions about Solon, rather than discovering real evidence. They assumed that Solon's surname was Alvarez (actually her middle name) and conducted their initial searches based on this name. As such, they found no record of her. There were eleven different spellings used by various officials, which also led to confusion. The initial investigation did not take into account the fact that Solon had been treated in the psychiatric ward in Lismore, which might have explained inconsistencies in evidence she gave to DIMIA officials.

Some key recommendations of the inquiry were:
 that the negative culture in the Compliance division of DIMIA be redressed;
 that DIMIA should review its information systems;
 that all staff should be instructed to take more care when performing their duties, and not act on the basis of assumptions;
 that all immigration detainees should be provided with adequate healthcare services.
The report also reaffirmed a number of the recommendations of the Palmer inquiry.

Response to the report.
Following the release of the report, Senator Vanstone announced that AUD $50.3 million would be spent on a College of Immigration, Border Security and Compliance in order to train DIMIA staff. AUD $17.9 million would also be spent on improving healthcare services at immigration facilities.

Labor spokesperson for immigration, Tony Burke called for Senator Vanstone to take responsibility for Solon's deportation, under the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. However, Vanstone refused to resign, saying that the general presumption was that ministers should not be responsible for things they did not know about. She also said:

"I'm thinking of trying to buy the copyright on Elton John's song I'm Still Standing, but I don't want to tempt fate. So I'll just play it to myself quietly at night."

Compensation claims.
Before Ms Solon's return to Australia, there was speculation in both the media and in the legal community about the possibility of a compensation claim being brought by her against the Commonwealth Government and/or the Department of Immigration.

Sydney-based lawyer, George Newhouse brought a legal team together including former Federal Court Judge and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission president Marcus Einfeld Q.C. and lawyer Harry Freedman, who travelled to Manila to discuss legal options with the Solon family.

Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties defended the urgency of legal action. He said: 
Only the Federal Government having to pay out money and having to defend a court case will bring home to the Federal Immigration Minister, and the Prime Minister, that rights and principles are there to be observed. Criticism of this government over its immigration policy is simply waived away; only when they have to pay money will they sit up and take notice.

On Vivian's return to Australia on 18 November 2005, Marcus Einfeld Q.C. confirmed that Vivian's compensation would be determined by retired High Court Judge Sir Anthony Mason after Vivian and her legal team had reached agreement on the form of a private arbitration. As part of the deal the Commonwealth Government confirmed that it would care for Vivian until the arbitration process was completed.

On 30 November 2006, Sir Anthony Mason awarded Solon a compensation payout, reported by The Age newspaper as AUD$4.5 million, although the Australian Government refused to confirm the amount, citing privacy reasons.

<doc id="2567563" title="Necip Faz?l K?sakürek" nonfiltered="1398" processed="1379" dbindex="1481413">
Necip Faz l K sakürek (1904 - 25 May 1983) was a Turkish poet, writer, and philosopher, who was noticed by the French Philosopher Henri Bergson, while Necip Faz l had been a student of his in Sorbonne during the 1920s. In his poetries, it is possible to realize the influences of Bergson.

 Definition .

In his own words, he was born in "a huge mansion at Çemberlita , in one of the streets descending towards Sultanahmet" (1904). He was educated at various schools, meanwhile at American College, and received his secondary education at Naval School (1922). He received religious courses from Aksekili Ahmed Hamdi and history courses from Yahya Kemal in this military school but he was actually influenced by  brahim A kî, who he defines to have "penetrated into deep and private areas in many inner and outer sciences from literature and philosophy to mathematics and physics".  brahim A kî provided his first contact with Sufism even at a "plan of skin over skin". "After completing candidate and combat classes" of Naval School, K sakürek entered the Philosophy Department of Darülfünûn and graduated from there (1921-1924). One of his closest friends in philosophy is Hasan Ali Yücel. He was educated in Paris for one year with the scholarship provided by the Ministry of National Education (1924-1925). He worked at the posts of official and inspector at Holland, Osmanl  and    Banks after returning home (1926-1939), and gave lectures at the Faculty of Linguistics and History and Geography and the State Conservatoire in Ankara and the Academy of Fine Arts in  stanbul (1939-1942). Having established a relation with the press in his youth, K sakürek quitted being an official after that time and started to earn his living from writing and magazines. 

Nacip Faz l K sakürek died in his house at Erenköy after an illness that "lasted long but did not affect his intellectual activity and writing" (25 May 1983) and was buried in the graveyard on the ridge of Eyüp after an eventful funeral. 

Necip Faz l was awarded the First Prize of C.H.P. Play Contest in 1947 with his play Sab r Ta  . K sakürek was awarded the titles of "Great Cultural Gift" by the Ministry of Culture (25 May 1980) and "Greatest Living Poet of Turkish" by the Foundation of Turkish Literature upon the 75th anniversary of his birth. 


 His Literature Life .
 
In his own words, having "learned to read and to write from his grandfather in very young ages", K sakürek became "crazy about limitless, trivia reading" until the age of twelve starting from "groups of sentences belonging to lower class writers of the French". He writes as follows: "My interest climbing up to the works such as (Pol ve Virjini), (Graziyella), (La-dam-d-kamelya), (Zavall  Necdet) claiming to be sensational and literary, eventually transformed into an illness and surrounded my nights and days as a net". Having been involved in literature with such a reading passion, Necip Faz l states that his "poetry started at the age of twelve" and that his mother said "how much I would like you to be a poet" by showing the "poetry notebook of a girl with tuberculosis" lying on the bed next to his mother's bed when he went to visit her staying at the hospital, and adds: "My mother's wish appeared to me as something that I fed inside but I was not aware of until twelve. The motive of existence itself. I decided inside with my eyes on the snow hurling on the window of the hospital room and the wind howling; I will be a poet! And I became". 

The first published poem of Necip Faz l is "Kitabe" poem that he later included in his book Örümcek A   with the title "Bir Mezar Ta  " and it was published in the Yeni Mecmua dated 1 July 1923. 

After this date K sakürek expanded his reputation until 1939 with his poems and articles published in magazines such as Yeni Mecmua, Milhi Mecmua, Anadolu, Hayat and Varl k and Cumhuriyet newspaper. 

After returning home from Paris in 1925, Necip Faz l stayed in Ankara intermittently but during long periods and in his third visit he published a magazine called A aç on 14 March 1936 by providing the support of some banks. A aç, the writers of which included Ahmet Hamdi Tanp nar, Ahmet Kutsi Tecer and Mustafa  ekip Tunç, decided to follow a spiritualist and idealist line on the contrary to the materialist and Marxian ideas supported by the writers such as Burhan Belge, Vedat Nedim Tör,  evket Süreyya Aydemir and  smail Husrev Tökin of closed Kadro magazine owned by Yakup Kadri and which influenced the intellectuals of the time greatly. K sakürek later transferred A aç magazine published during six volumes in Ankara to  stanbul, however, not finding much readers, the magazine was closed at the 17th volume. 

Necip Faz l this time published the magazine called Büyük Do u in 1943 which also had religious and political identity, fronted the rulers with Büyük Do u that he published intermittently as weekly, daily and monthly until 1978, he was prosecuted because of his articles and publications and the magazine was closed several times. Particularly objecting to secularism and supporting Sultan Abdul Hamid II, Necip Faz l gradually became one of the leaders of the Islamist section. It should be stated that as in A aç, the writers' cadre is quite cosmopolitan in the first volumes of Büyük Do u as well. From Bedri Rahmi to Sait Faik, many signatures of the new literature are seen on the pages of the magazine. 

However, as Necip Faz l transferred Büyük Do u into an organ of particularly religious quarrel, these writers have withdrawn from the pages one after another. Upon the collection of Büyük Do u in 1947, Necip Faz l also published a political humor magazine called Borazan, which he could publish only three volumes between November-December.

Thomas Pelham-Clinton was born in 1752 and died in 1795. He was an English nobleman.

He was the 3rd son of the 2nd Duke of Newcastle under Lyne and his wife, Lady Catherine Pelham, succeeding to the title unexpectedly after the death of his two elder brothers. 

After his education he embarked on a military career. He served in America during the American War of Independence as A.D.C. to his relative, General Sir Henry Clinton, and was later A.D.C. to the King. He ultimately achieved the rank of Major General in 1787.

Anadama bread is a traditional bread of New England made with white flour, corn flour, molasses and sometimes rye flour.  There are several popular myths about the origin of the name, which mostly take this form:

"A fisherman, angry with his wife, Anna, for serving him nothing but cornmeal and molasses, one day adds flour and yeast to his porridge and eats the resultant bread, while cursing, 'Anna, damn her.'"

This legend is considered dubious at best by food historians, despite not having a confirmed explanation for the name.  It is also not readily agreed exactly when or where the bread originated, except that it was before 1940.

<doc id="4910447" title="Ray Kassar" nonfiltered="1403" processed="1384" dbindex="1481418">

Raymond E. Kassar (born January 2, 1928) was president, and later CEO, of Atari from 1978 to 1983.  He had previously been vice-president of Burlington Industries, a textile company.

Ray Kassar was hired in February 1978 as president of Atari's consumer division by Warner Communications, who at the time owned Atari.  By this time, rifts had begun to develop between the original Atari staff (most of whom had engineering backgrounds) and the new hires brought in by Warner (who, like Kassar, mostly had business backgrounds).

In November of 1978, when Atari founder Nolan Bushnell left the company after a dispute with Warner over the future of Atari, Kassar became CEO.  Under his leadership, sweeping changes were made at Atari and the laid-back atmosphere that had existed under Bushnell's leadership all but disappeared.  Kassar's twenty-five years at Burlington Industries had given him a taste for order, organization, and efficiency and his efforts to revamp Atari along similar lines provoked substantial animosity.  Kassar shifted the focus away from game development and more toward marketing and sales.  Atari began to promote games all year around instead of just at the Christmas season.  R&D also suffered deep cuts and the discipline and security at Atari became strict.  Kassar became unaffectionately known to many at Atari as the "sock king" and the "towel czar" (due to his previous years in the textile industry) after he once referred to Atari programmers as "high-strung prima donnas" in an interview with the San Jose Mercury News in 1979.

During the Kassar years, Atari's sales grew from $75 million in 1977 to over $2.2 billion just three years later. Though Atari enjoyed some of its greatest success during this period, the stifling atmosphere and lack of royalties or recognition to the individual game designers angered employees, many of whom quit.  Several of these former Atari employees would go on to form Activision.  During this period, nearly all members of the original Atari staff, including Al Alcorn, quit or were fired.  Atari's upper management also suffered severe turnover rates.  Many blamed Ray Kassar's autocratic management style, but Kassar was not held accountable.

In 1981, the highly popular and successful game Yars' Revenge was released for the Atari 2600.  Howard Scott Warshaw, the game's designer, got the names "Yar" and "Razak" by jokingly spelling "Ray Kassar" backwards.

In 1982, Kassar donated a sum of money to Brown University, his alma mater. In recognition, the university named a university building the "Edward W. Kassar House".  The Kassar House is currently home to the university's mathematics department.

Contrary to popular belief, Kassar was not responsible for deal to make the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial game off of the blockbuster movie. Steve Ross, CEO of Atari's parent company Warner Communications, was the one who was in talks with Steven Spielberg and Universal Pictures.   Kassar's response to Ross' query of how he liked the idea of making an E.T. based video game was, "I think it's a dumb idea. We've never really made an action game out of a movie." Ultimately though, the decision was not Kassar's to make and it went through, and it was reported that Atari had paid US$20 25 million for the rights an abnormally high figure for video game licencing at the time. The game was not only poorly received and sold poorly, but demand had been widely overestimated.

In July of 1983, Kassar was forced to resign from Atari over mounting allegations of illegal insider trading activity.  In December of 1982, Kassar had sold 5,000 shares of stock in Warner Communications only hours before a much lower than expected fourth quarter earnings report would cause Warner stock to drop nearly 40% in value in the following days.  The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Kassar and then Atari vice-president Dennis Groth of trading stock with illegal insider knowledge.  Kassar settled, returning his profits without acknowledging guilt or innocence.  The shares that Kassar sold actually constituted only a small amount of his total holdings in the company, and the SEC later cleared him of any wrongdoing.

Upon Ray Kassar's resignation, James J. Morgan, formerly of Philip Morris, replaced him as CEO of Atari in September of 1983.  Since that time, Kassar has focused on investments and other hobbies.  He is now retired.

From December 2, 2000 until February 11, 2001 a series of photographs culled from Kassar's personal collection were on display at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.  The exhibition, entitled "Painterly Photographs: The Raymond E. Kassar Collection", presented 33 works made for exhibition from 1900 to 1910, featuring some of the most important camera artists of the time, including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Heinrich Kuehn, George Seeley and Clarence H. White.

<doc id="4462072" title="Magical Chase" nonfiltered="1405" processed="1386" dbindex="1481420">
 

Magical Chase (J:           )is a scrolling shooter video game developed by Palsoft and released by Quest in 1991 for the PC Engine video game console. The game's protagnoist is a witch (Referred to as a "Star Maiden" in the game) flying on a broomstick, along with two anthropormorphic stars, which serve as Gradius-style options. The game is very similar to Cotton, released by Sega in 1989.
Story.
From the game's box: 
 Ripple is a student of magic, and her teacher is a terrifying witch! Ripple's particularly afraid of her teacher right now, because she's just broken a promise she made to the witch; Ripple took a peek inside the forbidden book Sleeping Demons! No sooner had she opened the cover than out jumped six demons, which raced away! Unless she can catch all six demons and get them back inside the book, the witch will turn Ripple into a frog for breaking her promise! Ripple sets off on her quest with her two Elf-Star friends, Topsy and Turvy. Good luck, Ripple!!

Gameplay.
There are a total of six levels in the game which can be played on the normal and hard difficulty settings. Only the first three can be played on the easy difficulty setting. As enemies are destroyed, they leave different colored gemstones which are serve as the game's currency. Twice during each level, a house appears where power-ups, health, and extra lives can be purchased. Touching obstacles and the ground does not kill the player, like in say Gradius but does impede the progress. If the player gets trapped behind objects at the left-hand side of the screen, "scrolling damage" will occur.
Weapons and power-ups.
The weapons available varies in availability in each level. 
Stage 1: Balkan, 3-way;
Stage 2: Balkan, Swing;
Stage 3: Cracker ball, Bound;
Stage 4: Wave, bubble;
Stage 5: Homing, X4;
Levels and bosses.
Each stage is presented with the name of the mid-boss encountered, and keeping with the magic theme, is titled as a magical seal. Each level has a mid-boss and end-boss. At the end of each, the player is awarded a clear bonus of 1000 x the number of the level. 
1st seal: Cubolygon   This level takes place in a castle environment, composed of Tetris-like pieces. There are two bosses in this level, the first named one is a cube-shaped creature who attacks with a series of cubes that spread out in a concentric manner. The second boss is a large crude robot-like creature who shoots triangle-shaped projecticles. Along with the robot is its, controller, a winged goblin creature who fires large balls of green light.
2nd seal: Cubolygon   This level takes place in an archaic temple set in the middle of a forest. The mid-boss is a large acorn who fires bursts of smaller acorns. The end boss is a green-haired person who initially hides in a tree. After receiving some damage the creature bursts out of the tree and attacks the player with series of wide directional bursts of orange shots. The boss will also summon series of large stone blocks in an attempt to cause scrolling damage.
3rd seal: Kamikaze Dangun   This level takes place in a corridor of an airship that is constantly expanding and decreasing. This corridor, littered with obstacles, creates many points where scrolling damage can occur.  There is no mid-boss per se, but the enemy pictured in the level opening occurs in swarms throughout the beginning of the level. The end boss is a sheep-like creature who travels in and out of six pipes, and arises to shoot five large bursts that concentrically emanate.
4th seal: Fat Metal   This level seemingly takes place in the interior of the castle from the first level.  There are many obstcales to avoid. The mid-boss is a large metal fish that shoots a variety of large projecticles, including ice and steel balls. The end-boss is green-tinged creature sitting in a chair that shoots large waves, and groups of smaller green projecticles from two turrets. The player has to avoid obstacles while fighting.
5th seal: Gemini Snow   This level takes place outside a city during the night. The mid-boss are two snowmen with Jason-masks on who attack by shoting snowballs and rammingthe player. The end-boss is a large leg-less knight who throws axes and shoots fireballs at the player.
6th seal   This level is a series of boss encounters. The first two bosses are the mid-stage enemies encountered in the first and fourth seals respectively. Then the player encounters a large anthropormphic spiked-ball that throws smaller spiked-balls and green laser beams. The next boss is similar to the end-boss from the fifth seal; except only the head remains with a long snake-like body. This enemy shoots series of fireballs. The final enemy is a horned warlock archetype who carries  a big staff which shoots a variety of attacks. Late in the boss fight,  the boss will launch large undefeatble segmented dragons (similar to the enemies found in Salamander.

<doc id="6322017" title="The DoubleHappys" nonfiltered="1407" processed="1388" dbindex="1481422">

The DoubleHappys (sometimes spelt Double Happys) were a short-lived but influential rock band based in Dunedin, New Zealand, and part of the Dunedin Sound music wave of the 1980s. The band was comprised of Shayne Carter (previously of Bored Games), Wayne Elsey (previously of Bored Games and The Stones), and John Collie.

The band was formed in 1983, initially as a two-piece (Carter and Elsey), both playing guitar, and employing an old and erratic drum machine (christened "Herbie Fuckface"). Herbie proved too erratic and it was not long before the duo opted to recruit former school friend Collie to provide a more reliable rhythm section. They took part in the Flying Nun "Looney Tour" in February 1984, travelling around the country with various other bands, cutting a single - the "Double B-side" ("The Other's Way" and "Anyone Else Would") - in March.

Early in 1985, the band recorded an EP, Cut it Out and in June embarked on a short tour. Towards the end of the tour the band were travelling south from Auckland by train, and Elsey, in high spirits, climbed out of a carriage. Tragically, the train passed under a bridge, killing Elsey instantly.

The two remaining members of the band decided not to continue with the name, but later formed the nucleus of Straitjacket Fits.

A compilation CD featuring the single, EP, and live tracks, ws released in 1992.

Snowed In was a demo revue, produced in 1996 for Nickelodeon, created by Mitch Schauer in a successful attempt to sell The Angry Beavers.

In the pilot, the Beavers, Norbert and Daggett, are snowed in and trapped inside their house, so they try to think of things to do inside.

Notes.
 Dag and Norb look different in the pilot. Dag looks more devil-ish, while Norb has much shorter hair then he does in the actual series.
 Richard Horvitz voices Daggett here, but Nick Bakay is not Norb in the pilot. He is voiced by Kevin Meaney.
 Richard Horvitz revealed in a recent Podcast interview that he did not voice Daggett in the pilot.

In the motion picture industry, the term monkey points refers to the practice of many low budget production companies offering talent a percentage of a film's profits, as opposed to a percentage of the film's gross, or a fixed salary.  Since such projects usually never make any money, at least on paper - the talent who accepts a percentage of the project's profits usually never makes any money.

Joe's live shows include Live & Squeaky, 1996, Twin Squeaks, 1997, The Crazy World of Joe Pasquale, 1999, Bubble & Squeak, 2000, The Everything I Have Ever Done and the First of Many Goodbye Tours, 2004, Does He Really Talk Like That?, 2005 and Return of the Love Monkey, 2006. The VHS to Live & Squeaky grossed in excess of £1 million, earning Joe an award from The British Video Association.   

He has done five Royal Variety Performances, most recently in 2005. One year, Joe describes how he got drunk on the night with the other performers avoiding him for the entire evening. The situation worsened when the Queen greeted the performers, including Joe, who was the 'most drunk' he'd ever been.

In recent years Joe has begun acting on stage. In 1999 he appeared as a lead character in "The Nerd", the show received rave reviews, one source describing it as "rib shatteringly funny". He returned to the stage in Autumn 2004 in the comedy 'Tom, Dick and Harry'. 

Joe is also well known for his pantomime appearances. For 9 years he played 'Smee' in Peter Pan alongside former-soap actor Leslie Grantham. In December '04 and January '05 he played Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk at the Birmingham Hippodrome. The show was a massive success for the Hippodrome, and the shows sold out rapidly thanks to Joe's success in the jungle. Unfortunately tragedy struck in January when, whilst on stage, he fell and serverely injured his shoulder. Despite the mishaps though, this year Joe takes to the Hippodrome stage in Peter Pan, once again playing 'Smee'.

I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here!.
On 6 December 2004 he won the fourth series of the UK television show I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here!. Joe beat off competition from butler Paul Burrell and nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave. During his time in the jungle, Joe became well known for his relationship with the two emus and his use of the word Jacobs, a slang term for testicles.

He was the first celebrity to earn full stars in a Bushtucker trial. The special trial saw Joe climb out of an airborne helicopter and climb down a ladder recovering the stars as he went, notable due his fear of flying. Later on in the show Joe found himself being buried underground for five minutes with rats in a trial called Danger Down Under.

Before doing the show, Joe made his worries about doing the show clear. He insisted it wouldn't be the bushtucker trials that worried him, rather the other 'celebrities'. He claimed he was terrible and shy when it came to meeting new people, and was worried about them not liking him. However, he got on well with the other contestants.

For the 16-day duration of the show, Joe was the bookies' favourite for the entire time, so it came as no surprise when the presenters Ant & Dec announced him as the new King of the Jungle. The only surprise was that Paul Burrell, the bookmakers' biggest underdog at the start of the series, managed to come second. The vote between the two, percentage-wise, is believed to have been about 55-45 in Joe's favour.

 Since the jungle .
Since the Jungle, Joe became more popular, making numerous TV appearances including The Weakest Link, The Paul O'Grady Show and the popular Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway.

On 19 February 2005, ITV1 broadcast An Audience with Joe Pasquale, containing some routines from his stage show   culminating in the Edward Scissorhands inspired snow sequence. Nine million people tuned in, and ITV commissioned Another Audience With Joe Pasquale which aired in 2006.

In addition Joe is using his fame to raise money and awareness for charitable causes. With other celebrities, he backed the Man Alive 2005 campaign. The campaign, run by Cancer Research, is hoping to alert men of the dangers of being overweight, and hopefully encourage exercise. The main danger being highlighted in the campaign is that obesity/physical inactivity causes cancer in men. The cancer caused by obesity is preventable with a healthy diet and regular exercise.

For months during 2005, Joe toured the UK with his summer tour, Does He Really Talk Like That?! which is the name of his Autobiography due out in September 2006. The DVD of Joe's 2005 tour was released in time for Christmas 2005.

Joe went back to Birmingham to do panto again from 21st December 2005-29th January 2006. Joe played the part of Mr. Smee in the Qdos entertainments production of Peter Pan. He directed and produced his musical, 'Rent-A-Ghost', during Spring 2006.

His latest endeavour is presenting The Price Is Right at 2pm and 5pm, weekdays on ITV1. Previous hosts have included Leslie Crowther and Bruce Forsyth in 2001. Notably, he is insistent that the stars of the gameshow are the people selected from the audience, not, as the announcer portrays, him.

Joe has also found the time to overcome his fear of flying, and has now gained a piloting licence.

Joe toured during 2006 with a new show "The return of the love monkey" that was filmed in Southend, Essex, for a new DVD and to be shown on ITV in 2007.

In engineering and computer science, an implementation is the practical application of a methodology or algorithm to fulfill a desired purpose. For example, one might create a computer program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order. To do so, one would implement a known method of sorting.

In political science, implementation refers to the carrying out of public policy.  Legislatures pass laws that are then carried out by public servants working in bureaucratic agencies.  This process consists of rule-making, rule- administration and rule-adjudication.  Factors impacting implementation include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the implementing bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and presidential or executive support.

<doc id="1393811" title="Agnostic theism" nonfiltered="1416" processed="1397" dbindex="1481431">
Agnostic Theism is the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism.  An agnostic theist is one who views that the truth value of certain claims particularly existence of god(s) is unknown or inherently unknowable but chooses to believe in god(s) in spite of this. There are contrasting views of the term.

Views of Agnostic theism.
Many views exist depending on how Theism, Agnosticism, Belief, and Knowledge are defined.

Theism as belief in god(s), Agnosticism as don't/can't know.

According to Theism, the opinion that gods or deities exist, and Agnosticism is that existence unknown or inherently unknowable. Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.;

The classical philosophical understanding of knowledge is that knowledge is justified true belief. By this definition, it is reasonable to assert that one may hold a belief, and that belief may be true, without asserting that one knows it. Agnostic Theism could be interpreted as an admission that it is not possible to justify one's belief in god(s) sufficiently for it to be considered known.

According to Fideism this logic statement was used:
 Christian theology teaches that people are saved by faith in the Christian god. (i.e. trust in the empirically unprovable).
 But, if the Christian God's existence can be proven, either empirically or logically, to that extent faith becomes unnecessary or irrelevant.
 Therefore, if Christian theology is true, no immediate proof of the Christian God's existence is possible.

see also, Sola fide;

According to Faith "Faith, by its very nature, requires belief outside of known fact.";

According to Existence of God: Agnosticism "Agnostics may or may not still believe in gods based on Fideilistic convictions.";

Theism as belief, Agnosticism as doubt of god(s).
Christian Atheism.
A position that would qualify as agnostic theist, would be in a temporary state of doubt.  In short, a theist becomes an agnostic theist when they lose their confidence in the existence of a divinity to some degree but still choose to believe in it. Theists may admit that they experience such doubts that they do not wish to question, in which case they become an agnostic theist. If they experience something that assures them of the existence of some form of divinity, then they will no longer qualify as agnostic theists.

Theism as belief in knowing of god(s), Agnosticism as doubt of god.
According to Theologies opposed to fideism, other Christian views such as Catholicism, Theism requires 100% belief with no doubt at all, and Agnosticism is a form of doubt.

What is Agnostic Theism on About.com.  	 
On "What is Agnostic Theism?", the author talks about the position that agnosticism is more  reasonable  than theism because it eschews theism s dogmatism being inaccurate, and how atheism and theism deal with belief, agnosticism deals with knowledge. Weak agnosticism is about personally not having knowledge of god, and strong agnosticism is believing that knowledge about god is impossible. Since belief and knowledge are independent, it's possible to be both. Faith contrasts with knowledge, and people believe through faith. Even Christians have to admit they don't know everything about god, especially using the phrase,  God works in mysterious ways.  	 

Other pages. 	 
On Atheism vs. Agnosticism, it distinguishes the differences in meanings of agnosticism and atheism, and explains how agnosticism is compatible with both atheism and theism. Also, if atheism is closed minded, then so is theism, and if theism can be open minded, then so can atheism.

Problems and Criticism.
This biggest problem and criticism of agnostic theism is the simple argument that in order to be religious, you must believe in God, whether or not you have proof. If you acknowledge you don't have proof, but you still believe in God, this is consistent with Fideism. If you acknowledge you don't have proof, and you let that knowledge affect your belief, then you can not really consider yourself religious.

If the former statement (that proof does not negate belief) is to be considered a proper definition of agnostic theism, then there is no difference between it and Fideism.

George H. Smith's rebuttal.
In Atheism: The Case Against God George H. Smith argues that all agnosticism is a form of atheism (defined here as "lacking a belief in a deity").  His argument against agnostic theism is that it is contradictory to state that a being is inherently or currently unknowable, and yet positively assert a belief in its existence.  His argument goes:
"One cannot possibly know that something exists without some knowledge of what it is that exists.";
If it is declared unknowable, the concept of "god" becomes meaningless. The agnostic theist's statement of belief therefore becomes equivalent to "a blark exists.";
This unspecified belief ("I believe in 'something'") is equivalent to nonbelief ("I am not convinced by any particular religious claim").  Therefore the so-called agnostic theist is in fact an atheist (by being unable to assert a positive belief in any specific deity).
It ensues that all agnosticism is a form of atheism.
If the agnostic theist still wishes to believe, he must ascribe attributes of some sort to the belief.  However, they would then be claiming some knowledge of their deity and are therefore no longer agnostics but are theists instead.
Smith concisely describes the paradox on pg 44: 
 To posit the existence of something which, by its nature, cannot be known to man is to submerge oneself in hopeless contradictions.  When one claims that something is unknowable, can one produce knowledge in support of this claim?  If one cannot, one's assertion is arbitrary and utterly without merit. If one can, one has accomplished the impossible: one has knowledge of the unknowable.  The theist who is called upon to explain the content of his belief - and who then introduces the "unknowable" as a supposed characteristic of the concept itself - is saying, in effect: "I will explain the concept of god by pointing out that it cannot be explained."

<doc id="7277012" title="Greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions" nonfiltered="1422" processed="1403" dbindex="1481437">
In mathematics, an Egyptian fraction is a representation of a natural number as a sum of unit fractions, as e.g. 5/6 = 1/2 + 1/3.  As the name indicates, these representations have been used as long ago as ancient Egypt, but the first published systematic method for constructing such expansions is described in the Liber Abaci (1202) of Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci).  It is called a greedy algorithm because at each step the algorithm chooses greedily the largest possible unit fraction that can be used in any representation of the remaining fraction.

Fibonacci actually lists several different methods for constructing Egyptian fraction representations (Sigler 2002, chapter II.7). He includes the greedy method as a last resort for situations when several simpler methods fail; see Egyptian fraction for a more detailed listing of these methods. As Salzer (1948) details, the greedy method, and extensions of it for the approximation of irrational numbers, have been rediscovered several times by modern mathematicians, earliest and most notably by Sylvester (1880); see for instance Cahen (1891) and Spiess (1907). A closely related expansion method that produces closer approximations at each step by allowing some unit fractions in the sum to be negative dates back to Lambert (1770).

The expansion produced by this method for a number x is called the greedy Egyptian expansion, Sylvester expansion, or Fibonacci-Sylvester expansion of x. However, the term Fibonacci expansion usually refers, not to this method, but to representation of integers as sums of Fibonacci numbers.

 Algorithm and examples .

In Fibonacci's algorithm, we expand the fraction x/y that we desire to represent, by repeatedly performing the replacement
;
(simplifying the second term in this replacement as necessary).  For instance:
;
in this expansion, the denominator 3 of the first unit fraction is the result of rounding 15/7 up to the next larger integer, and the remaining fraction 2/15 is the result of simplifying (-15 mod 7)/15 3 = 6/45. The denominator of the second unit fraction, 8, is the result of rounding 15/2 up to the next larger integer, and the remaining fraction 1/120 is what is left from 7/15 after subtracting both 1/3 and 1/8.

As each expansion step reduces the numerator of the remaining fraction to be expanded, this method always terminates with a finite expansion; however, compared to ancient Egyptian expansions or to more modern methods, this method may produce expansions that are quite long, with large denominators. For instance, this method expands
;
while other methods lead to the much better expansion
;
Wagon (1991) suggests an even more badly-behaved example, 31/311. By the greedy method we get an expansion with ten terms, the last of which has over 500 digits in its denominator; however, there exists a much shorter representation, 1/12 + 1/63 + 1/2799 + 1/8708.

 Sylvester's sequence and closest approximation .

Sylvester's sequence 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, ... can be viewed as generated by an infinite greedy expansion of this type for the number one, where at each step we choose the denominator  instead of . Truncating this sequence to k terms and forming the corresponding Egyptian fraction, e.g. (for k = 4)
;
results in the closest possible underestimate of 1 by any k-term Egyptian fraction (Curtiss 1922; Soundararajan 2005). That is, for example, any Egyptian fraction for a number in the open interval (1805/1806,1) requires at least five terms. Curtiss (1922) describes an application of these closest-approximation results in lower-bounding the number of divisors of a perfect number, while Stong (1983) describes applications in group theory.

 Maximum-length expansions and congruence conditions .

Any fraction x/y requires at most x terms in its greedy expansion. Mays (1987) and Freitag and Phillips (1999) examine the conditions under which x/y leads to an expansion with exactly x terms; these can be described in terms of congruence conditions on y.

 Every fraction 1/y requires one term in its expansion; the simplest such fraction is 1/1.

 Every fraction 2/y for odd y > 1 requires two terms in its expansion; the simplest such fraction is 2/3.

 A fraction 3/y requires three terms in its expansion if and only if y   1 (mod 6), for then -y mod x = 2 and y(y+2)/3 is odd, so the  fraction remaining after a single step of the greedy expansion,
;
is in simplest terms. The simplest fraction 3/y with a three-term expansion is 3/7.

 A fraction 4/y requires four terms in its expansion if and only if y   1 or 17 (mod 24), for then the numerator -y mod x of the remaining fraction is 3 and the denominator is 1 (mod 6). The simplest fraction 4/y with a four-term expansion is 4/17. The Erd s Straus conjecture states that all fractions 4/y have an expansion with three or fewer terms, but when y   1 or 17 (mod 24) such expansions must be found by methods other than the greedy algorithm.

More generally the sequence of the smallest denominators y leading to the longest expansion for each x is
1, 3, 7, 17, 31, 109, 253, 97, 271, ... .

 Approximation of polynomial roots .

Stratemeyer (1930) and Salzer (1947) describe a method of finding an accurate approximation for the roots of a polynomial, by applying the greedy algorithm to compute the greedy expansion of the root, at each step maintaining a polynomial the root of which is the remaining fraction to be expanded. For instance, suppose we want to find the greedy expansion of the golden ratio, one of the two solutions of the polynomial equation P0(x) = x2 - x - 1 = 0. Following Stratemeyer and Salzer, we perform the following sequence of steps:

Since P0(x) < 0 for x = 1, and P0(x) > 0 for all x   2, there must be a root of P0(x) between 1 and 2. That is, the first term of the greedy expansion of the golden ratio is 1/1. If x1 is the remaining fraction after the first step of the greedy expansion, it satisfies the equation P0(x1 + 1) = 0, which we can expand as P1(x1) = x12 + x1 - 1 = 0.
Since P1(x) < 0 for x = 1/2, and P1(x) > 0 for all x > 1, the root we are seeking lies between 1/2 and 1, and the next term in its greedy expansion is 1/2. If x2 is the remaining fraction after this step of the greedy expansion, it satisfies the equation P1(x2 + 1/2) = 0, which we can expand as P2(x2) = 4x22 + 8x2 - 1 = 0.
Since P2(x) < 0 for x = 1/9, and P2(x) > 0 for all x > 1/8, the next term in the greedy expansion is 1/9. If x3 is the remaining fraction after this step of the greedy expansion, it satisfies the equation P2(x3 + 1/9) = 0, which we can again expand as a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, P3(x3) = 324x32 + 720x3 - 5 = 0.

Continuing this approximation process eventually produces the greedy expansion for the golden ratio,

 .

 Other integer sequences .

The length, minimum denominator, and maximum denominator of the greedy expansion for all fractions with small numerators and denominators can be found in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as sequences A050205, A050206, and A050210, respectively. In addition, the greedy expansion of any irrational number leads to an infinite increasing sequence of integers, and the OEIS contains expansions of several well known constants. Some additional entries in the OEIS, though not labeled as being produced by the greedy algorithm, appear to be of the same type.

 Related expansions .

In general, if one wants an Egyptian fraction expansion in which the denominators are constrained in some way, it is possible to define a greedy algorithm in which at each step one chooses the expansion
;
where d is chosen, among all possible values satisfying the constraints, as small as possible such that xd > y and such that d is distinct from all previously chosen denominators. For instance, the Engel expansion can be viewed as an algorithm of this type in which each successive denominator must be a multiple of the previous one. However, it may be difficult to determine whether an algorithm of this type can always succeed in finding a finite expansion. In particular, the odd greedy expansion of a fraction x/y is formed by a greedy algorithm of this type in which all denominators are constrained to be odd numbers; it is known that, whenever y is odd, there is a finite Egyptian fraction expansion in which all denominators are odd, but it is not known whether the odd greedy expansion is always finite.

<doc id="8692493" title="Dracula (Spanish Version)" nonfiltered="1423" processed="1404" dbindex="1481438">


Dracula is a spanish-language version of the more famous Tod Browning-directed Dracula starring Bela Lugosi.

It the early days of sound, it was common for Hollywood studios to produce foreign language versions of their films (usually in French, Spanish and German) using the same sets, costumes and etc. Unfortunately, most of these foreign language versions no longer exist. The Spanish version of Dracula is an exception. The Spanish language version of Drácula was made by director George Melford who simultaneously filmed the movie using the same sets at night. 

In recent years this version has become more highly praised by some than the English language version. The Spanish crew had the advantage of watching the dailies from the English crew's version when they came in for the evening and they would figure out better camera angles and more effective use of lighting in an attempt to "top" it.  As a result, this version's supporters consider it to be much more artistically effective.
The Spanish semiologist Roman Gubern considers that the longer duration allows better development of the plot in spite of the shorted shooting time and smaller budget.

The Spanish version was included as a bonus feature on the Classic Monster Collection DVD in 1999, the Legacy Collection DVD in 2004 and the 75th Anniversary Edition DVD set in 2006.

 Plot Summary .
Renfield, a solicitor, makes a journey into Transylvania via stagecoach.  He mentions his destination, Castle Dracula, to the locals who react with alarm.  They tell him Count Dracula is a vampire and when he doesn't believe them, one insists he wear a cross.  When he arrives at the Castle, the Count bids him welcome. After drinking drugged wine, Renfield  drops the cross and is bitten.

Aboard ship, a now-enslaved Renfield laughs menaically below as Dracula picks off the crew one by one.  When the ship reaches England, he is the only living person found.


Dracula meets Dr. Seward and his family at the Opera.  Lucia is completely fascinated by him and that night becomes his victim.  Professor Van Helsing is called in, and he recognizes the danger for what it is.  He also realizes that Dr. Seward's patient Renfield is somehow tied up in events.  But soon after meeting the Doctor's new neighbor, Dracula, he figures out who is a vampire--based on the fact Dracula casts no reflection in the mirror.  Not a moment too soon, because by now Seward's daughter Eva is falling under his spell.  To her horror, she feels increasingly weak and also increasingly wild--at one point attacking her fiancee Juan.

With Seward's and Harker's help, Van Helsing seeks to trap Dracula but he outwits them and escapes with Eva by seizing control of a nurse's mind.  They follow Renfield into Carfax Abbey--an act which ends with Dracula killing his slave by strangulation then tossing him from a tall staircase.  Deep in the catacombs under Carfax, they find Dracula asleep and Eva, still alive.  Van Helsing drives a stake through the vampire's heart.

Deviations from the novel.
This list is not exhaustive, but intended to convey a sense of the differences between the film and the novel:
 The setting is shifted to circa 1930.
 Renfield goes to Transylvania and is victimized.  He is found, insane, aboard the Demeter.;
 Dracula does not "youthen.";
 The characters of Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris are omitted.
 Dr. Seward is Eva's father, not Lucy's suitor.  Lucy is his ward.
 Dracula does not have multiple coffins.  He can only change into a bat, not a wolf.
 Dracula must sleep by day.
 Dracula is killed by Van Helsing, with a wooden stake.

 Differences with the English Version .
 At the Borgo Pass, the coach driver from the castle (who is Dracula, in disguise) actually has his face covered.
 Renfield cuts his finger with a breadknife, not a paper clip.
 The Brides bite Renfield, rather than Dracula himself.
 The plotline of whatever happened to Lucia is resolved.  Van Helsing destroys her.
 In this version we get to see an additional exterior shot of Carfax Abbey, not seen in the US version.
Eva's costume is far more revealing than the one worn by Helen Chandler.
 When Renfield is in Carfax Abbey, he carried a torch rather than a lamp.  His death is more violent is this version as well.
 In general there is a great deal more camera movement and atmospheric lighting.

 Trivia .
 Two years after this film was made, Lupita Tovar married the producer Paul Kohner.
 According to the book Hollywood Gothic, only Carlos Villarías in the cast was allowed to watch "dailies" from the English language version.  He was encouraged to be as Lugosi-like as possible.

<doc id="971428" title="Kung Lao" nonfiltered="1428" processed="1409" dbindex="1481443">

Kung Lao is a character in the Mortal Kombat fighting game series.

About Kung Lao.
Alongside Liu Kang, Kung Lao is one of the most popular characters in the Mortal Kombat series. He stands in the shadow of his great ancestor, the Great Kung Lao, but unlike his great ancestor he has no desire to be champion and would rather live a life of peace. He is the sparring partner and best friend of Earth's champion, his fellow Shaolin monk Liu Kang. As well, he has sought counsel from master Bo' Rai Cho. Of the Earthrealm warriors, Kung Lao is the most outspoken pacifist, although he will not hesitate to severely punish those who attack him, Earthrealm, or his friends. His trademark is his razor-rimmed hat, which he can employ quite powerfully and effectively in combat. Many of his fatalities involve the use of his hat to some extent.

Storyline.
Kung Lao is the last known descendant of the Great Kung Lao, a former Champion of Mortal Kombat, who lost the title to Goro 500 years previously, resulting in Lao's death at Goro's hands and the start of Shang Tsung's rule over the tournament. Like his friend, Liu Kang, Kung Lao is also a member of the White Lotus Society. Kung Lao was originally the one to represent the Shaolin in the Mortal Kombat tournament but he declined, knowing of the consequences of becoming champion. As a result, Liu Kang was chosen and emerged as the winner.

When the Shaolin Temples were attacked by Baraka and his Tarkatan soldiers, Liu Kang and Kung Lao resolved to travel through the portal to the Outworld and avenge their fallen Shaolin brothers. Although he joined his friend in his furious quest, Kung Lao's ultimate goal was to rebuild the White Lotus Society at the Wu Shi Academy, in order to train a new generation of warriors for the coming ages. He, along with Liu Kang, ventured into Outworld to do battle with Outworld's forces in a new tournament. Following Shao Kahn's defeat at Liu Kang's hand, the monks returned to Earth and began training the next generation of Shaolin warriors.

When Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm came, he had to temporarily scrap his plans for reforming the Society. Eventually, Kung Lao faced Shao Kahn; the Emperor of Outworld defeated Kung Lao and injured him so badly that he was believed to have died. Hearing of Kung Lao's apparent death enraged Liu Kang, as he challenged Shao Kahn and successfully defeated him for the second time. With Outworld driven back, Kung Lao decided not to return to the Shaolin Temples, instead allowing everyone to believe that he was dead and went on to live a life of peace in respect to the beliefs of his ancestors. This would not last long however, as he was drawn away from his newfound peace to help fight against Shinnok's forces, when word reached him that Goro, the Shokan warrior who had killed the Great Kung Lao centuries ago, was still alive. After Shinnok's defeat, Kung Lao attacked Goro, who had signed a peace treaty with the Centaurs under the mediation of Kitana. Instead of being an attempted assassination, however, the blow was a ceremonial strike of vengeance for the Great Kung Lao's death. With this act, the two warriors shook hands, their feud over.

The next years were peaceful. This ended on a brutal note at the time of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, when the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung united and murdered Liu Kang in a vicious attack (Tsung posing as Kung Lao to get close to the champion). Kung Lao found the body of his longtime friend, and was told immediately by Raiden that Tsung was the assassin, who had formed the Deadly Alliance with Quan Chi. Enraged, Kung Lao vowed revenge upon the sorcerer, and once again abandoned his pacifist Shaolin beliefs. He believed his current skills were insufficient to defeat Shang Tsung so after meeting with the other Earthrealm warriors and traveling to Outworld, Kung Lao sought the advice of the martial arts teacher Bo' Rai Cho. Bo' Rai Cho trained Kung Lao for a short time, teaching him the 'whirlwind kick' maneuver. Together, they joined the other warriors in the assault against the two sorcerers. Kung Lao would not rest until Liu Kang was avenged, and  Shang Tsung had paid with his life.

But the assault did not end well. With Liu Kang dead, Raiden and his companions were fighting a losing battle. Kung Lao and Kitana challenged the Deadly Alliance. Kung Lao fought Shang Tsung one on one but because of Shang Tsung's soulnado, the sorcerer was able to keep his power at it's peak, making the battle very difficult. Things would get worse as Kung Lao's allies would perish in the battle, one by one. Kitana would fall against Quan Chi and Kung Lao would fall to the hands of Shang Tsung. Despite his improved skills, it wasn't enough and Kung Lao died, leaving only Raiden to battle the Deadly Alliance. However, Kung Lao was revived by Onaga as a slave during the events of Deception, but in MK Armageddon, he is shown apparently released from Onaga's control, without any explanation given as to how it happened. Ermac's Deception ending, which shows him and Liu Kang's spirit being successful in rescuing the slaved Earthrealm warriors, is generally accepted as the possible explanation, though no official word has been made as to whether this is true or not.

Fujin's bio for Mortal Kombat: Armageddon describes Kung Lao as having joined forces with the God of Wind to bring their former comrades Raiden and Liu Kang under control, with the God of Thunder becoming "as ruthless as Shao Kahn" and Liu Kang's corpse selectively slaying various people. Fujin then goes on to state in his bio that if no way was found to revert the two corrupted warriors back to normal, both he and Kung Lao would be forced to finish them. It is as yet unknown what Kung Lao's outlook on this matter is, at least until his own bio is officially released by Midway.

In his Armageddon ending, Kung Lao goes back in time after defeating Blaze. He meets his old ancestor, and with his blessing, takes his place in the Mortal Kombat tournament. He defeats Goro and becomes the MK Champion and was a legend. As a result, Liu Kang never competed, and his and Kung Lao's rivalry with him never came to be. 

Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks and characterization changes.
In the adventure game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Kung Lao's character was explored to a greater degree than had been shown in the previous MK games. However, the character presented in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is very different then the Kung Lao seen in Mortal Kombat II through Deadly Alliance. Many fans do not consider the events of MK:SM as canon, as it contradicts Mortal Kombat II story many times as the game progresses, and Kung Lao fans are also highly critical of his characterisation here.

Kung Lao as depicted in MK:SM is almost resentful of Liu Kang's victory in the Shaolin tournament. Although he and Liu Kang are shown to be friends- much of the time- he constantly baits his fellow Shaolin monk, especially regarding Princess Kitana, and the tournament that "Raiden" (in reality, a disguised Shang Tsung) has sent them to compete in. A rivalry between the two Shaolin monks was hence established for the first time in MK:SM. As the two fighters defeated Shang Tsung's warriors, they gained victories in Mortal Kombat, forming a race of sorts to become the Champion of Mortal Kombat. Kung Lao, especially, is seen gloating to Liu Kang that he will win this tournament. This rivalry escalates until the two warriors are convinced that the other has been corrupted by the Outworld.

This character is completely at odds with the Kung Lao in Mortal Kombat Gold and Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. In these games it is established that Kung Lao is, at heart, a man of peace; he fights when he must- to defeat Shinnok, to avenge Liu Kang and stop the Deadly Alliance- but, at his core, he wishes to pursue the pacifist ideals of his ancestors, and thus he disappeared after his "death" in Shao Kahn's invasion to live his life according to these principles. In contrast, the Kung Lao in MK:SM is eager to fight, and has an almost desperate need to "beat" Liu Kang in the Outworld, supposedly to "free his ancestors". With the somewhat immature dialogue at times between Liu Kang and Kung Lao in MK:SM, many fans were angry at the way the noble Shaolin monk had been portrayed as a battle-hungry glory-seeker.

With Mortal Kombat: Armageddon's release, it seems- to the disappointment of many fans- that the creative team are considering the rivalry between Liu Kang and Kung Lao as canonical. Kung Lao's ending makes reference to this, stating that he was able to go back in time, stand in for the Great Kung Lao (to his agreement) and defeat Goro 500 years before Liu Kang, ending the rivalry before it started.

Combat characteristics.
Signature moves.
Wind Teleport: Kung Lao could reappear behind his opponent. Could be followed by multiple moves.  (MKII, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKG, MK:SM,MK:A);
Double Pass Teleport: Kung Lao could pass twice before appearing behind his opponent.  (MKT, MKG, MK:SM);
Hat Throw: Kung Lao could hurl his hat at the opponent.  (MKII, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKG, MKDA, MK:SM, MK:A);
Whirlwind Kick: Kung Lao flies towards his opponent spinning like a tornado, doing multiple kicks that knocks them down. (MK:DA, MK:A);
Aura Spinning Shield: He would spin creating an aura around him that would knock his opponent into the air.  (MKII, MKT, MK:SM);
3D Shield: Spinning like a tornado he could knock his opponent into the air.  In Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Mortal Kombat Gold he could move while spinning.  (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKG, MK:SM);
Dive Kick:  Also called the Bullet Kick, Kung Lao could dive down from the air and attack his opponent.  (MKII, MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKG, MK:SM, MK:A);


Recurring fatalities.
Body Slice: Kung Lao brings his razor hat down, slicing the opponent vertically in half with a clean swipe. (MKII, MK:SM);
Hat Decapitation: Kung Lao throws his hat, which arcs upward suddenly, slicing his enemy's head off. (MKII, MKT, MKG);
Hat Trick: Kung Lao tosses his hat at an enemy, decapitating them.  The hat then ricochets off the far wall of the screen and doubles back, cutting the enemy in half.  A third ricochet slices the enemy off at the knees. (MK3, UMK3);
Tornado: Kung Lao executes his Cyclone Spin, and sucks the opponent into it, causing them to explode violently. (MK3, UMK3, MK:SM);

Appearance in other media.
Comic books.
Kung Lao's only depiction on an outside media is in Malibu Comics series. His story is slighty altered, stating he is an exile in Outworld due to the failure of his ancestor, and the fall of his lineage. During the Blood & Thunder series he has a minor participation rescuing a near-death Liu Kang after he was backstabbed by Kano. 

In the Battlewave series, he joins with Kitana, Baraka and Sub-Zero in an attempt to ovethrow the Emperor Shao Kahn. During the comics, he shares a very close relation with Kitana, contradicting the games' official story about Liu Kang and Kitana's love relationship.

Kung Lao was featured in his own eponymous one-shot issue from Malibu Comics in the summer of 1995. The comic, entitled Rising Son, shows Kung Lao's struggle against Shang Tsung and his shape-shifting mind tricks, using his friend's forms (Kitana, Baraka and Sub-Zero) as well as his ancestor's form to kill him. It would be the very last issue produced in Malibu's Mortal Kombat series.

Trivia.
His MK3 character bio was not included in the arcade version of Mortal Kombat 3.  It was later made available for the home versions of MK3.
Kung Lao's hat was inspired by the 1964 James Bond movie Goldfinger, in which a character named Oddjob threw his derby as a weapon.
He, and Kintaro are the only characters from the first two MK games who have not appeared in any of the movies and the cartoon series.
Midway has not enlightened whether Kung Lao's hat is an ancestral item used by the Great Kung Lao or a weapon he made for himself.

The King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in the United Kingdom for three-year-old and above thoroughbreds run over a distance of 1 mile 4 furlongs (2,414 metres) at Ascot Racecourse in July.

The race was created as the result of an amalgamation of the King George VI Stakes, run in October since 1946 as a race for three-year-olds over a distance of two miles, and the Queen Elizabeth Stakes which had been run each July since 1948 at one and a half miles. The amalgamated race was first run during the Festival of Britain in 1951, and was called the Festival of Britain King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The 'Festival of Britain' was removed from the name in 1952 and the race continued until 1974 as the 'King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes'. Since 1972 it has been sponsored by the diamond company De Beers, and in 1975 permission was given by Queen Elizabeth II for the word 'Diamond' to be included in the title.

It is probably the highest quality race in the United Kingdom and it is an opportunity for the leading middle-distance three-year-olds to compete against the more established older horses.  This race can often put the merits of the classic generation into context.

Winners.
1951-1999.

Scott Johnson (born 1952) is an American composer known for his pioneering use of recorded speech as musical melody.  His 1978 work John Somebody for electric guitar and recorded speech is an early example of speech melody framed in tonal harmony.  Its influence has been wide, notably on many works of Steve Reich including Different Trains and Three Tales.

Johnson is also known for his distinctive crossing of American vernacular and art music traditions, making extensive use of electric guitar in concert works, and adapting popular music structures for art music genres such as the string quartet.

Johnson has been widely commissioned by artists including the Kronos Quartet and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra.  He lives in New York City.

Glod is a Gypsy village in Moreni Municipality, Dâmbovi a County, Romania, having a population of 1,513.  Its name means "mud" in Romanian. It is located near the towns of Pucioasa and Fieni.

Role in Borat.
Glod was a shooting location for the mockumentary film , representing Borat's home village in Kazakhstan.  The Daily Mail claimed that the villagers were paid 15 lei (£3), or about 6 dollars a day each for their appearances and that they were told the film would be a documentary about the hardships of village life. According to 20th Century Fox, the movie s nature was obvious to everyone since it included blatantly ridiculous scenes like one of a cow inside someone s house. Fox claims that the production team and star Sacha Baron Cohen each donated $5,000 to the town, as well as paid a location fee, and bought computers, school and office supplies for the residents. In the film, some of the villagers are depicted as rapists, abortionists, and prostitutes for Baron's comedy movie. Two residents of Glod,  Nicolae Todorache and Spiridon Ciorbea, have hired the services of Edward Fagan to sue the producers of the film. The lawsuit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in a hearing in early December 2006 on the ground that the charges were too vague to stand up in court. Fagan plans to refile.

<doc id="2304415" title="UDP hole punching" nonfiltered="1433" processed="1414" dbindex="1481448">

In computing, UDP hole punching refers to a commonly used NAT traversal technique.

Description.
NAT traversal through UDP hole punching is a method for establishing bidirectional UDP connections between Internet hosts in private networks using NAT. It does not work with all type of NATs as their behavior is not standardized.

The basic idea is to have each host behind the NAT contact a third well-known server (usually a STUN server) in the public address space and then, once the NAT devices have established UDP state information, to switch to direct communication hoping that the NAT devices will keep the states despite the fact that packets are coming from a different host.

UDP hole punching will not work with a Symmetric NAT (also known as bi-directional NAT) which tend to be found inside large corporate networks.  With Symmetric NAT, the IP address of the well known server is different than that of the endpoint, and therefore the NAT mapping the well known server sees is different than the mapping that the endpoint would use to send packets through to the client.  For details on the different types of NAT, see network address translation.

A somewhat more elaborate approach is where both hosts will start sending to each other, using multiple attempts. On a restricted Cone NAT, the first packet from the other host will be blocked. After that the NAT device has a record of having sent a packet to the other machine, and will let any packets coming from this IP and port number through.

The technique is widely used in P2P software and VoIP telephony. It is one of the methods used in Skype to bypass firewalls and NAT devices.  It can also be used to establish VPNs (using, e.g., OpenVPN).

The same technique is sometimes extended to TCP connections, albeit with much less success.

Algorithm.
Let A and B be the two hosts, each in its own private network;
N1 and N2 are the two NAT devices;
S is a public server with a well-known globally reachable IP address.

 A and B each begin a UDP conversation with S; the NAT devices N1 and N2 create UDP translation states and assign temporary external port numbers;
 S relays these port numbers back to A and B;
 A and B contact each others' NAT devices directly on the translated ports; the NAT devices use the previously created translation states and send the packets to A and B;

As a base for this mineral cabinet a collection of 1195 specimens was bought by Gotvald, a doctor of medicine from Danzig, at the behest of Tsar Peter the Great. This collection was enriched by the material from Russian deposits and opened for public view in 1719.

During the reign of Peter the Great mineral collections grew very quickly. They were replenished with specimens which were presented to members of the imperial court or to the tsar personally. For example, in 1718 Charles XII of Sweden presented to Peter a magnificent example of natural, crystallized "rope" of silver from the royal silver mines at Kongsberg in Norway. This 21 cm long specimen called "Silver Horn" is the oldest specimen in the collections of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In 1745 the collection included more than 3000 minerals, fossils, gems and rocks. By this time it was already one of the most enviable Europe collections with a great aesthetic and scientific value. This great quantity of material required sorting and cataloging. The first to be appointed to the task of organizing the mineral cabinet was a German scientist Johann Gmelin (1709-1755). Thereafter, Mikhail Lomonosov, who had just completed his studies in Germany, continued his work. For almost five years, Lomonosov sorted out the collection and compiled a catalogue which was published in 1745.

On 5 December 1747 a great fire destroyed virtually the whole collection. Only the most valuable items were saved, including the "Silver Horn". In 1836 the Kunstkamera was divided into 7 separate museums, including Mineralogical museum which was moved to the new building. In 1898 the museum was significantly expanded and renamed the Geological museum.

In 1912, the name was changed to the Museum of Geology and Mineralogy, dedicated to Peter the Great. The mineral research laboratory was founded and research trips were organized to the Urals, Siberia and Transbaikalia.

In Moscow.
Museum was moved from Petersburg to Moscow in 1934 together with the Russian Academy of Sciences. Thirty railway carriages were required to move the museum's collection of more than 60,000 specimens. The relocation and setting up of the exhibition took three years of energetic work. In 1936 and 1937 the museum organized independent exhibitions in Moscow.

Collections.
All museum acquisitions since 1716 were divided at the beginning of 20th century by the academician Vladimir Vernadsky to 5 main collections:
 Systematic collection consists of more than 90000 items representing about 2400 mineral species (from 4000 species known in nature). Mineral specimens in this collection demonstrating diversity of mineral species by it constitution, morphology, physical properties, associations with other minerals.
 Crystal collection includes more than 4800 crystals of minerals representing all crystal systems and most of space groups. Mineral specimens in this collection demonstrating different forms and their combinations, twinning laws, perfection and defection of  natural and man made crystals.
 Locality collections included more than 31000 specimens representing genetic features, mineral association and ore types for more than 300 former Soviet Union deposits and couple dozen well known localities in other countries.
 Pseudomorph collection includes about 2200 mineral specimens, representing different kinds pseudomorphs and also different features of mineral growing and transformations in various conditions.
 Gems and stone art collection includes  mong 8000 rough and faceted gemstones, items made of stones. Rather big part of this section is Russian stone art of 18-20 centuries including about 30 items designed by famous Russian juvelir Peter Carl Fabergé.

<doc id="82025" title="Monterey County, California" nonfiltered="1436" processed="1417" dbindex="1481451">

Monterey County is a county located on the Pacific coast of the U.S. state of California, its northwestern section forming the southern half of Monterey Bay. (Santa Cruz County forming the northern half). As of 2000, the population was 401,762.  The county seat is Salinas.  Monterey County is a member of the regional governmental agency, Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments.

The beautiful coastline, including Big Sur, California State Route 1, and the 17 Mile Drive on the Monterey Peninsula has made the county world famous.  The City of Monterey was the capital of California under Spanish and Mexican rule.  The economy is primarily based upon tourism in the coastal regions, and agriculture in the Salinas River valley.  Most of the population is concentrated along the northern coast and Salinas valley, while the southern coast and inland mountain regions are almost devoid of human habitation.

History.
Monterey County was one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood.  Parts of the county were given to San Benito County in 1874.

The county derived its name from Monterey Bay. The word itself is composed of the Spanish words monte and rey, which literally means "Hill" and "King". The bay was named by Sebastian Vizcaino in 1602, in honor of Gaspar de Zuniga y Acevedo, Conde de Monterrey, the Viceroy of New Spain.

Geography.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 9,767 km² (3,771 mi²).  8,604 km² (3,322 mi²) of it is land and 1,163 km² (449 mi²) of it (11.91%) is water.

Home Prices.

As of December 2005, Monterey County ranked among America's ten most expensive counties with Santa Barbara County topping the list with a median home price of $753,790. In Monterey County, the median home price was $699,900. In the northern, more densely populated part in the county, the median home price was even higher, at $712,500, making it the fourth most expensive housing market in California. The disparity between the median household income of roughly $48,305 and the median home price of $700k has been cause for recent concern over excluding protential home buyers from the market.

<doc id="6923241" title="Oboro (Basilisk)" nonfiltered="1438" processed="1419" dbindex="1481453">
 
Oboro (japanese:  , hiragana:    , r maji: Oboro) the primary heroine of the Japanese anime Basilisk Kouga Ninpou Chou (known in English as the Kouga Ninja Scrolls). 

As the beautiful young princess of Iga Tsubagakure, Oboro was selected to be one of ten ninja to represent her clan against the ten chosen fighters of the rival Koga Manjidani clan.   Born with 'Mystic Eyes,' Oboro has the power to neutralize the techniques of any ninja that meets her gaze directly.  After the death of her grandmother Ogen, Oboro ascends to take leadership of the clan, but due to her passive demeanor soon finds her authority usurped by Yakushiji Tenzen. 

Among the Iga, Princess Oboro is something of an oddity.  Sweet natured with a gentle disposition, Oboro lacks any real talent for either martial arts or ninjutsu and is also a bit of a clutz.  This, along with her love for Gennosuke of the rival Koga clan has caused most of Iga to view Oboro as something of a black sheep, a fact she is painfully aware of.  When the Hattori truce is lifted, the other Iga ten are quick to take advantage of Oboro's feelings for Gennosuke, tricking her into inviting him and Udono Jousuke into their compound where the Iga can keep them under surveillance.  

Although hurt and betrayed by their actions, Oboro remains loyal to her clan and is greatly torn between her duty and her feelings when the truth of the renewed conflict is finally revealed to her.  Ultimately, she makes the decision to temporarily seal her eyes shut with a potion given to her by Ogen called the Seven Days of Darkness, knowing that if she saw any of her clansmen attacking Gennosuke, she might be tempted to use her powers against them instead.

Prior to the lifting of the Hattori truce, Oboro was engaged to Kouga Gennosuke in an attempt to bring a lasting peace between both clans.  The two had known each other since childhood and were anxious to spend their lives with each other.  In the anime, Oboro would frequently meet with Gennosuke along their clan's borders to practice a Japanese fan dance which they planned to perform for their guests at their wedding.

In the anime, she is voiced by Nana Mizuki (Japanese) and Laura Bailey (English)

Conflicts.



Oboro VS Jingoro (episode 4): While not a match in the traditional sense, the scene is notable as it's the first time the audience witnesses Oboro's stronger and borderline ruthless side.  After breaking up the fight between Akeginu and Udono Jousuke, Oboro came across a trail left by Amayo Jingoro in his transformed state leading from the clan's salt shed to the guest house where Gennosuke was staying.  Upon confirming her lover's safety, Oboro located Jingoro skulking in the rafters of the guest house's veranda and promptly used her Mystic Eyes to cancel his technique and forcibly revert him into a semi-solid state.  Despite Akeginu's pleas for Oboro to give him water so Jingoro could safely resume him human form, Oboro ordered Jingoro to be left alone and sent him crawling in agony toward a nearby spring as punishment for his transgression.



Oboro VS Tenzen (episode 14):   In perhaps the series' darkest moment, Oboro was confronted in her cabin by Tenzen while she and other remaining Iga were travelling by boat to Sunpu to intercept the Koga.  Tenzen again attempted to convince her to fight alongside the others and bring victory to their clan but Oboro stated that even if her eyes weren't sealed by the Seven Days of Darkness, she was unable to physically or mentally stand against Gennosuke and had already accepted that she would die by her lover's hands, to which Tenzen replied left him with only once choice as he menacingly caressed her cheek.  When Oboro nervously asked if he intended to kill her, Tenzen replied that he was going to make her forget about Gennosuke by filling her with the Spirit of Iga (IOW-he was going to have sex with her). 

Outraged and frightened, Oboro attempted to slap him away but Tenzen grabbed her wrist and pulled her against him, his hand slipping inside her kimono to roughly fondle her breast.  Oboro screamed in terror as Tenzen then wrestled her to the deck; pinning her beneath him as he pulled open her kimono and told Oboro the others knew what was occuring and had agreed not to interfere.  (In truth, Tenzen had sent Akeginu and Jingoro under false pretenses to the other side of the ship while Chikuma Koshirou stood guard outside the cabin.)  As she turbulently struggled beneath him, Tenzen reminded Oboro amidst his malicious pawing of her that the only men left in Iga who could possibly qualify for her husband was himself, Koshirou, and Jingoro.  Oboro frantically screamed that she would rather die than be with anyone besides Gennosuke and begged Tenzen to kill her; but Tenzen sinisterly answered that her bloodline was far too important to do so as he attempted to force her legs open.

Outside, Koshirou covered his ears to block out Oboro's cries for help; his mind torn between his devotion to his princess and his loyalty to his sensei.  Although he knew Oboro was the rightful leader of Tsubagakure and didn't deserve to be treated so cruelly, he was unable to stand against his mentor's orders as Tenzen was the best chance the Iga had of obtaining victory.  It was only until after Oboro began screaming for him specifically, causing images of her innocent smiling face to flash in his mind that Koshirou was unable to take it anymore and he frantically stumbled into Oboro's cabin begging Tenzen to stop; but someone else had beaten him to it.  From out of the deck, Kasumi Gyoubu had materialized behind Tenzen and strangled him before Tenzen could achieve penetration; his powerful hands crushing Tenzen's throat like a paper cup.  As both were blind, neither Oboro nor Koshirou understood what had occured and unbeknownst to her, Gyoubu had materialized behind Oboro and was seconds away from killing her in the same manner when Akeginu and Jingoro stormed into the cabin.  Although safe for the moment, the event traumatized Oboro into staying as far away as she could from Tenzen for the rest of the series.

Oboro & Gennosuke VS Tenzen (episode 22-23): The climactic fight of the series.  Unable to bear the agonized screams of Kagerou, Oboro begged Tenzen to cease his torture of her but found herself the target of his sadistic intentions as Tenzen attempted to rape Oboro a second time; only to be interrupted by Gennosuke who had come to rescue Kagerou. Tenzen charged Gennosuke and following a vicious duel through which Tenzen had the advantage (due to Gennosuke's eyes still being sealed by the Seven Days of Darkness)  Gennosuke tricked Tenzen into overextending himself which gave Gennosuke the oppurtunity to decapitate him with his sword.  

Shortly afterward, members of the Takechiyo sect discovered Tenzen's remains and put them back together.  But just as Tenzen began to regenerate, the Seven Days of Darkness potion Oboro had used on herself finally wore off and she stared at him with her Mystic Eyes.  With his technique being neutralized, Tenzen struggled against her until Oboro greatly overpowered him and his head was blown into pieces; finally killing Tenzen once and for all. But even though she was justified in doing so (Tenzen had manipulated the whole war between the clans, used her feelings for Gennosuke to lead him into a trap, tortured Kagerou to borderline death in front of her, sacrificed innocent bystanders, and even attempted to rape her twice), Oboro bitterly cried as she killed him. In the manga, right after that, Oboro dragged Gennosuke's injured body behind a stair and waited for the arrival of Lady Kasuga, managing to manipulate the situation into staging a fair last duel.

Oboro VS Gennosuke (episode 24): The final battle of the series. After being in the presence of Hattori Hanzo the 4th, Gennosuke and Oboro stood facing each other on the banks of the same river their grandparents had killed each other on so as to finish the war between the clans. Oboro knew about this beforehand after she was approached by Hanzo Hattori's adopted son and right hand, Hattori Kyouhachirou, who provided her with the sword she'd need to face Gennosuke. 

Oboro knew however that she wouldn't be able to kill Gennosuke so when the time came, she stabbed herself through her chest with the sword that Kyouhachirou gave her.  Oboro's actions were not only a testimonial to her love for Gennosuke despite all that had occured; but was also an offering to the Koga as compensation for those who had died as well as a way of striking back at the Takechiyo sect for using her clan in its bid for power.

When Gennosuke's eyes finally became unsealed, Oboro's dead body lying at his feet was the first thing he saw and he grieved deeply. After enacting a small measure of retribution against Okufu, Gennosuke wrote in blood that Oboro was the survivor of the War; thereby abdicating the Koga's victory to the Iga. Gennosuke then carried his lover's body into the river and fatally stabbed himself, drifting away with Oboro tightly clasped against him as the current bore them both to a place where they could finally be together for all eternity.



Manga.

Oboro in the anime is slightly more fatalistic, mature and down-to-earth than her manga incarnation. After learning of the Hattori Truce's nullification in the manga, Oboro decides that in order to show her regret to Gennosuke for her clan's actions she will allow him to kill her and then wait for him in the afterlife.  In contrast, Oboro in the anime is doubtful that Gennosuke would ever forgive her even if she allowed him to kill her, but accepted it as her fate due to the devotion she felt for him as well as the hope her sacrifice would move him to not seek any further retribution upon her clan.

Alternate information.

Oboro is also featured as a character in the live-action movie known as SHINOBI Heart Under Blade, being played by actress Yukie Nakama. Unlike her anime/manga incarnation, Oboro in the film is both a capable fighter and gradually became less conflicted between her feelings for Gennosuke and her duty to the Iga.  Following the deaths of all their comrades, during their last duel Gennosuke allows Oboro to kill him, in order to save their clans and keep their hope for peace. Later, when Tokugawa Ieyasu sent troops to destroy the Koga and Iga villages, Oboro begs him to spare them, blinding herself as a proof of her sincerity. Ieyasu accepts, thus the villages are saved.

In the original novel; Oboro is described as having a face like the sun with large, round, mesmerizing eyes.  Her personality is closer to the manga than the anime and comparatively speaking; recieves noticeably less attention in the novel than either the manga or anime.  As with the manga and anime, Oboro lacks martial ability and her only skill is her mystic eyes.

<doc id="756950" title="Martin Documentation" nonfiltered="1439" processed="1420" dbindex="1481454">
Martin Documentation is a documentation methodology designed to provide different information about procedures depending on the audience and use of the document while also providing for procedure development, procedure change and error correction in both procedures and their documentation. 

Martin Documentation is intended both for documenting existing procedures and developing new ones.


Implementation of a Martin Documentation project.

Creating and maintaining Martin Documentation is a procedure and can therefore itself be described with Martin Documentation.
The first step in implementing a Martin system is to create Martin documents describing the documentation procedures for the particular organization, i.e. workgroup, factory or corporation. However, Martin Documentation recognizes that different procedures require different amounts and types of documentation at different times, that procedures and their documentation change over time and procedures are created outside of formal frameworks. This means that the procedures for creating the procedures and documentation can be very vague
and informal at first, e.g. a copy of this article, and then grow as needed with the rest of the project.

Framework.

Martin Documentation recognizes that procedures are created outside of any formal framework through the creativity of the human mind therefore a document describing a procedure can be a note scribbled on a piece of paper, pre-existing documentation from before the Martin Documentation project was started, documentation from a vendor or any other source and the Martin system allows all documents to be included within its framework.

The Martin framework consists of a set of documents for each procedure. The documents for a procedure can be thought of as a tree structure with a trunk, branches and roots. The same information is repeated in different places in the tree which suggests storing the information in a database where software can create documents as needed by gathering details from stored information and provide hyperlinks from one document to another.

Trunk documents and branches.

Documents making up the trunk formally describe the procedure as it should be performed. Documents
at the top of the trunk, the thinner documents, describe the procedure in the least detail while documents at the bottom, the thicker documents, have the most detail. Each document in a trunk contains all the information in the document above it. The trunk can be set up like an expanding outline and stored electronically with the different levels of documents being created from the outline as needed. It may also be desirable to create documents that one could consider to be on the same level but have slightly different details e.g. for the same procedure performed with different equipment or at a different location.

Suggested trunk levels.

indexing information- e.g. document number, catalog number, department number, project code, etc. (Some of this may be hidden when printing thicker documents, be considered ancillary documents for the main document number or all of the indexing information may be ancillary to the title.);

procedure title and possibly text descriptions of the indexing information;

short descriptions of the steps to be used by a trained person as a reminder and possibly headers for the steps described in the document below. This should include procedures for preventing and detecting common errors.

detailed description of each step in the process. (This level or a variation of this level will most likely be used as the formal documentation when needed.);

detailed description of each step with notes and explanations about particular situations and links to procedures for correcting errors.

above with explanations about why certain steps are done a particular way to be used as a guide when developing changes to procedures or creating a procedure on the fly for correcting an error.

Branches.

Each document on the trunk may be associated with ancillary documents which can be represented in a database as links to other information including other procedure documents.

Root documents.

Root documents can be pretty much anything having to do with the procedure. Often it will contain historical documents, outside sources and documents about infrequent situations. All procedures start out as root documents even if they only exist in the mind. Most procedures will become part of the Martin system by inclusion as a root document. This allows a procedure to be included by simply giving it a title and links to other documents in the system. Computer databases allow root documents to be stored electronically or may provide information for finding physical documents.

Principles of Martin Documentation.
Inclusion.

Procedures and changes to procedures originate from outside the system and must be put into the Martin system before they are lost.
People should be encouraged to record any ideas about a procedure in any form so that at the very least it may be included as a root document and available for future development. All procedures start out as a procedure title or number attached to a root document. Some root documents may also be linked as ancillary documents to trunk documents. Procedures for including root documents should not be so complex as to discourage their inclusion and should instead be designed to encourage their inclusion.

For many procedures the root document may be all that is required for a very long time and an effort to create thicker trunk documents should not be considered a necessity.

Expansion.

If it is necessary to create or change a trunk document, the root documents, existing trunk documents and existing ancillary documents are available as a resource. It might be helpful to create a procedure document describing how to make the decision to expand the documentation of a procedure. At what level a trunk document is created should depend on the nature of the need and the existing documentation for the particular procedure. 

Error prevention, correction and detection.

Procedures should include prevention, detection and correction of errors. Procedures for correcting errors should not encourage people to leave errors uncorrected.

History.

Martin Documentation was inspired by the naturally occurring evolution of software documentation in free software projects. Originally described by Jeffrey John Martin.

The North Aleutians Basin is a geographic phenomenon, primarily a submarine depression, occurring in the southern Bristol Bay region of the Bering Sea and just off the northern shore of the Alaska Peninsula.  It extends some 600 miles (960 km) along the Alaska Peninsula (northeast-southwest) and nearly as far north-south into the center of the Bering Sea. Primarily composed of gravel and sand, the near-shore zone is famously muddy towards its eastern flank.

Long known for its potential riches, the area was heavily prospected by oil and gas prospectors, mostly notable Shell, from the early 1960s through the present. Since the area is important for the highly-prized sockeye salmon fishery, particularly in communities like Dillingham, Naknek, and King Salmon, the entire area was until recently subject to a federal offshore drilling moratorium.

As recently as October 2005, both the state of Alaska and the U.S. Minerals Management Service had plans to develop the oil, and especially natural gas, potential of the area. One proposal would have offshore platforms extracting natural gas north of the village of Nelson Lagoon and transporting the gas via pipeline to a processing facility to the Pacific Ocean side near Sand Point.

<doc id="748253" title="Third-wave feminism" nonfiltered="1445" processed="1426" dbindex="1481460">


Third-wave feminism is a term identified with several diverse strains of feminist activity and study beginning in the early 1990s. The movement arose as a response to perceived failures of second-wave feminism. It was also a response to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second-wave. 

Overview.
Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second wave's "essentialist" definitions of femininity, which (according to the third wave) often assumed a universal female identity and over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle class white women.  A post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality is also central to much of the third wave and helps to account for its heightened emphasis on the discursive power and fundamental ambiguity inherent in all gender terms and categories. Third wave theory usually encompasses queer theory, women-of-color consciousness, post-colonial theory, critical theory, transnationalism, ecofeminism, and new feminist theory. 

Third wave feminists often focus on "micropolitics," writing about forms of gender expression and representation that are less explicitly political than their predecessors. They also challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what is, or is not, good for females.

Third wave in popular culture.
Ideals and debates associated with third-wave feminism were reflected in popular culture of the 1990s and 2000s.  Some feminists see it as a cultural movement and trace its origin to the early 90's Riot Grrrl movement.

History.

In the fall of 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.  During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, Anita Hill, an African-American law professor from Oklahoma, came forward and said that she had been sexually harassed by Thomas almost a decade earlier, while she had been employed under him.  In response to the Thomas hearings, Rebecca Walker published an article titled  Becoming the Third Wave  in a 1992 issue of Ms. in which she declared,  I am not a postfeminism feminist.  I am the Third Wave.    This event is often marked as the beginning of the usage of the term third wave applied to feminism (the "wave" concept of social progress was floated by futurist Alvin Toffler in his 1980 book titled The Third Wave).  As Amber Kinser has argued, Walker's was "a notable expansion of feminist space for women of color."

The roots of the Third Wave began, however, in the mid 1980's. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like Gloria Anzaldua, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherrie Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice.  They sought to negotiate prominent space within feminist thought for consideration of race related subjectivities. This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the Hill-Thomas hearings, but began to shift with the Freedom Ride 1992.  This drive to register voters in poor communities of color was surrounded with rhetoric that focused on rallying young feminists.  For many, the rallying of the young is the emphasis that has stuck within third wave feminism.

 Dietary concerns .

Some third-wave feminists such as Carol Adams reject the consumption of meat and analogize the use and objectification of animals to the use and objectification of women in society.  This criticism focuses on societal construction of ties between women and the environment and references the fact that a large majority of livestock animals are female.

A retirement plan is an arrangement to provide people with an income, possibly a pension, during retirement, when they are no longer earning a steady income from employment, or an asset from which a person may draw an income from as needed. There are significant, though varied and complicated tax advantages for many types of retirement plans. In passing the laws offering those advantages, Congress has expressed a desire to encourage plans that provide retirement security. Plans designed to replace a specific amount of steady income are known as defined benefit plans (though exceptions do apply), and those designed to accumulate as an asset without requiring a specified income are known as defined contribution plans. Retirement plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, the government or other institutions such as employer associations or trade unions. Retirement plans have increased in importance and in being utilized by more of the US population over the last half century but especially since 1980. Since 1980 and increasingly since 2000, there has been a shift from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans. Less and less defined benefit plans are being offered because they represent a large and not fully predictable cost to employers. As of 2005, most defined benefit plans are offered by large and/or governmental employers.

Retirement plans are defined in tax terms by the IRS code and most are also regulated by the Department of Labor's ERISA provisions. There are a wide variety of plans available and a very large amount of tax laws and regulations affecting them.

Types of retirement plans.
Retirement plans may be classified as defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the benefits are determined. A defined benefit plan guarantees a certain payout after retirement, according to a fixed formula which usually depends on the member's salary and the number of years' membership of the plan. In a defined contribution plan, the payout is dependent upon the amount of money contributed, and the performance of the investment vehicles utilized.

Some types of retirement plans, such as cash balance plans, combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.

Defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan, according to the Internal Revenue Code Section 414 are employer sponsored plans with an individual account for each employee. The accrued benefit from such a plan for an employee must be solely attributed to contributions made into his individual account and investment gains less any losses and expense charges. The contributions are invested, for example in the stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or negative) are credited to the individual's account. On retirement, the member's account is used to provide retirement benefits, sometimes through the purchase of an annuity which provides a regular income. Defined contribution plans have become more widespread all over the world in recent years, and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries. For example, the number of DB plans in the US has been steadily declining, as more and more employers see the large pension contributions as a large expense that they can avoid by disbanding the plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan.

Examples of defined contribution plans include Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k), and profit sharing plans. In such plans, the employee is responsible, to one degree or another, for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other securities. Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages, and some provide for a portion of the employee's contributions to be matched by the employer. In exchange, the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the investor prior to reaching a certain age typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old (with a small number of exceptions) without incurring a substantial penalty.

Money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer contributions or matching. Defined contribution plans are subject to IRS limits on how much can be contributed, known as the section 415 limit. The total deferral amount including the employee and employer contribution is the lesser of $40,000 or 100% of compensation. The employee only amount is $14,000 for 2004 with a $4,000 catch up. These amounts increase in 2006.

Defined benefit plans.
The statutory definition of the defined benefit plan encompasses all pension plans that are not defined contribution, i.e. that do not have individual accounts.

While this catchall definition has been interpreted by the courts to capture some hybrid pension plans like Cash balance plans and pension equity plans (PEP), traditional retirement plans by large businesses, or, for government workers, by the government itself are in the form of the final salary plan, under which the pension paid is equal to the number of years worked, multiplied by the member's salary at retirement, multiplied by a factor known as the accrual rate. 

The cash balance plan with or without a formula that specifies an exact benefit at retirement, whatever amount is accumulated can be available as a monthly pension at retirement or a lump sum at retirement and possibly before. The only requirement is that it must provide a benefit in the form of a lifetime annuity at normal retirement age as required (by the Internal Revenue Code) of all defined benefit plans. The amount of the annuity benefit must be definitely determinable as per IRS regulation 1.412-1. 

Social Security is a form of state-sponsored retirement benefits, beyond those provided by employers, which are funded by payroll taxes. 

Defined benefit plans may be either funded or unfunded. In a funded plan, contributions from the employer, and sometimes also from plan members, are invested in a fund towards meeting the benefits. The future returns on the investments, and the future benefits to be paid, are not known in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will be enough to meet the benefits. Typically, the contributions to be paid are regularly reviewed in a valuation of the plan's assets and liabilities, carried out by an actuary. In many countries, such as the USA, the UK and Australia, most private defined benefit plans are funded, because governments there provide tax incentives to funded plans.

In an unfunded plan, no funds are set aside. The benefits to be paid are met immediately by contributions to the plan. Most government run retirement plans, such as the social security system in the USA and most European countries, are unfunded, with benefits being paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions. In some countries, such as Germany, Austria and Sweden, company run retirement plans are often unfunded.

Hybrid and Cash Balance Plans.
Hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined contribution plan designs. In general, they are usually treated as defined benefit plans for tax, accounting and regulatory purposes. As with defined benefit plans, investment risk in hybrid designs is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with defined contribution designs, plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a notional account balance, and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment. These features make them more portable than traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a more highly mobile workforce. A typical hybrid design is the Cash Balance Plan, where the employee's notional account balance grows by some defined rate of interest and annual employer contribution.

In the US, plan conversions from traditional to hybrid plan designs have been controversial, notably at IBM in the late 1990s. Upon conversion, some plan sponsors retrospectively calculated employee account balances   if the employee's actual vested benefit under the old design was more than the account balance, the employee entered a period of wear away where he or she accrued no new benefits. Hybrid designs also typically eliminated the generous early retirement provisions in traditional pensions.

As a result, critics of cash balance plans have seen the new designs as discriminatory against older workers. On the other hand, the new designs may better meet the needs of a modern workforce and actually encourage older workers to remain at work, since benefit accruals continue at a constant pace as long as an employee remains on the job. Court cases have split on this issue and therefore not resolved these problems. Currently both the Senate and House have legislation to clarify the legal status of future cash balance plans. In the interim, Treasury has placed a moratorium on future determination letters on cash balance plans. The proposed legislation on cash balance age discrimination (much like the principle in criminal appeal that convicts convicted under the old procedure cannot win on appeal by applying the new rule retroactively US v. Teague, 489 US 288 (1989)) does not cover the legal status of current plans in existence.

While the Cash Balance Plan mentioned above is hybrid which is a defined benefit plan designed enable workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit in the manner of a defined contribution plan (the Defined Benefit design of Cash Balance plans provides the advantage of PBGC insurance but the risk of insolvency), the Target Benefit plan is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement and targeted to match a defined benefit plan. In a Target Benefit plan, a typical Defined Benefit design, say 1.5% of salary per year of service times the final 3-year average salary, is used to provide the target. Actuarial assumptions like 5% interest, 3% salary increases and the UP84 Life Table for mortality are used to calculate a level flat contribution rate that would create the needed lump sum at retirement age 65 for each entering employee.

The problem with such Target Benefit DC plans is that the flat rate could be low for young entrants, like 8% for a 21 year old, and high for old entrants. This may appear unfair. But the skewing of benefits to the old worker is a feature of most traditional defined benefit plans; and any attempt to match it would reveal this backloading feature.

This points out the key difference among DC and DB plans for ordinary workers   awareness. The DC plan like the 401k is easy for workers to understand the value of, while the DB plan is typically undervalued by workers until they get really close to retirement age.

Requirement of Permanence.
To guard against tax abuse in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has promulgated rules that require that pension plans be permanent as opposed to a temporary arrangement used to capture tax benefits. Regulation 1.401-1(b)(2) states that "hus, although the employer may reserve the right to change or terminate the plan, and to discontinue contributions 
thereunder, the abandonment of the plan for any reason other than 
business necessity within a few years after it has taken effect will be 
evidence that the plan from its inception was not a bona fide program 
for the exclusive benefit of employees in general. Especially will this 
be true if, for example, a pension plan is abandoned soon after pensions 
have been fully funded for persons in favor of whom discrimination is 
prohibited...". The IRS would have grounds to disqualify the plan retroactively even if the plan sponsor initially got a favorable determination letter. Determination letters like "'no-action letters'" from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are advisory and to the extent the tax-payer's actions have pandered the taxpayer is on the hook.

Qualified retirement plans.
Receive the normally discussed tax advantages and are regulated by ERISA. The technical definition of qualified does not agree with the commonly used distinction. For example 403(b) plans are not considered qualified plans, but are treated and taxed almost identically.

SIMPLE IRAs.
SEP IRAs.
 'HR 10' or Keogh Plans.
Nonqualified plans.
Plans that do not meet the guidelines required to receive the tax advantages that qualified plans do. They are typically used to provide additional benefits to key or highly paid employees such as executives and officers without the restrictions that qualified plans carry. Most offer little or no tax advantages, but are used for their flexibilty as incentives for key employees. Examples are SERP (supplemental executive retirement plans) and 457(f) plans.

For additional info, see the constructive receipt theory and related doctrines of the cash equivalence and economic benefit, as well as Amend v. Commissioner, 13 Tax Court 178 (1949), Pulsifer v. Commisioner, Irish sweepstakes, 64 Tax Court 245 (1975), and Revenue Ruling 60-31.

Contrasting types of retirement plans.
Advocates of defined contribution plans point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all. However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts. 

Portability, Valuation.
Because defined contribution plans have actual balances that workers can simply know the value of with certainty by simply checking the balance. There is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an IRA, though it is relatively uncommon in the US not to allow this.

However, because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker's vested accrued benefit is uncertain, the IRS (in Section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue) Code specifies the interest and mortality that must be used. This has caused some employers as in the Berger versus Xerox case in the 7th Circuit (Richard A. Posner was the judge who wrote the opinion) with cash balance plans to have a higher liability for employers for a lump sum than was in the employee's "notional" or "hypothetical" account balance. 

When the interest credit rate exceeds the IRS mandated Section 417(e) discounting rate, the legally mandated lump sum value payable to the employee the plan sponsor allows for pre-retirement lump sums would exceed the notional balance in the employee's cahs balance account. This has been colourfully dubbed the "Whipsaw" in actuarial parlance. The current House of Representatives version of the pension reform bill has a provision to liberalise the use of the 417(e) discount rate to reduce the lump sum value and avoid the whipsaw. However it must survive the conference committee with the version of the bill the Senate has passed.

Portability: Practical, not a Legal difference.
A practical difference is that a defined contribution plan's assets remain with the employee, even if he or she transfers to a new job or decides to retire early, whereas in many countries defined benefit pension benefits are typically lost if the worker fails to serve the requisite number of years with the same company. Self-directed accounts from one employer may usually be 'rolled-over' to another employer's account or converted from one type of account to another in these cases.

Because defined contribution plans have actual balances, employers can simply write a check because the amount of their liability at termination of employment which may be decades before actual normal (65) retirement date of the plan, is known with certainty. There is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an IRA, though it is relatively uncommon in the US not to allow this.

Just like there is no legal requirement to give portability to defined contribution plans, there is no mandated ban on portability for defined benefit plans. However, because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker's vested accrued benefit is uncertain, the IRS mandate in Section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code specfies the interest and mortality that must be used. This uncertainty discussed in valuaton of defined benefit lump sums has limited the practical portality of defined benefit plans.

Investment Risk borne by Employee or Employer. 
It is commonly said that the employee bears investment risk for defined contribution plans while the employer bears that risk in defined benefit plans. This is true for practically all cases, but pension law in the United States does not require that employees bear investment risk, it only provides an ERISA Section 404(c) exemption from fiduciary liability if the employer provides the mandated investment choices and gives employees sufficient control to customize his pension investment portfolio APPROPRIATE to his risk toleratnce.

PBGC insurance, a legal difference.
ERISA (The Employee Retirement Income Security Act) does not provide insurance from the PBGC for defined contribution plans, but cash balance plans do get such insurance because they like all ERISA defined benefit plans are covered by the PBGC.

Plans may also be either employer provided, or individual plans. Most types of retirement plans are the former, though individual plans, known as IRAs or Individual Retirement Accounts are very common.

Tax advantages.
Most retirement (the exception being most non qualified plans) plans offer significant tax advantages. Most commonly the money contributed to the account is not taxed as income to the employee, but in the case of employer provided plans, the employer is able to receive a tax deduction for the amount contributed as if it were regular employee compensation. This is known as pre-tax contributions, and the amounts allowed to be contributed vary significantly among various plan types. The other significant advantage is that the money in the plan is allowed to grow through investing without being taxed on the growth each year. Once the money is withdrawn it is taxed fully as income. There are many restrictions on contributions, especially with 401(k) and defined benefit plans that are designed to make sure that highly compensated employees do not gain too much tax advantage at the expense of lesser paid employees.

Currently two types of plan, the Roth IRA and the newly introduced Roth 401(k), offer tax advantages that are essentially reversed from most retirement plans. Contributions to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s must be made with money that has been taxed as income, but after meeting the various restrictions, money withdrawn from the account is tax-free.

EGTRRA and later changes.
EGTRRA 2001 brought significant changes to retirement plans, generally easing restrictions on the ability to roll money from one type of account to the other and increasing contributions limits. Most of the changes were designed to phase in over a period of 4-10 years, and unless they are extended, will "sunset", or revert, at the end of 2010 to the previous laws.

History of pensions in the United States.
The Revenue Act of 1913, passed following the passage of the 16th amendment to the constitution which permitted income taxation, recognized the tax exempt nature of pension trusts. At the time, several large pension trusts were already in existence- including the pension trust for ministers of the Anglican Church in the United States.
1940s: General Motors chairman Charles Erwin Wilson designed GM's first modern pension fund. He said that it should invest in all stocks, not just GM.
1963: Studebaker terminated its underfunded pension plan, leaving employees with no legal recourse for their pension promises.
1974: Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)   imposed reporting and disclosure obligations and minimum standards for participation, vesting, accrual and funding on U.S. plan sponsors, established fiduciary standards applicable to plan administrators and asset managers, established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to ensure benefits for participants in terminated defined benefit plans, updated the Internal revenue Code rules for tax qualification, and authorized Employee Stock Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") and Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs"). Championed by Senators Jacob K. Javits, Harrison A. Williams, Russell Long, and Gaylord Nelson, and by Representatives John Dent and John Erlenborn.
198?: The First Cash Balance Plan - Kwasha Lipton creates it by amending the plan document of 'fill in employer name' pension plan. The linguistic move was to avoid mentioning actual individual accounts but using the words hypothetical account or notional account.
1991: A Magazine article claims that pension- and retirement funds own 40% of American common stock and represent $2.5 trillion in assets.;
Growth and Decline of Defined Benefit Pension Plans in the United States. In 1980 there were approximately 250,000 qualified defined benefit pension plans covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. By 2005, there are less than 80,000 qualified plans.

<doc id="455914" title="Mini-ITX" nonfiltered="1456" processed="1435" dbindex="1481471">
Mini-ITX is a low-power motherboard form factor developed by VIA Technologies. Mini-ITX has similarities to ATX, microATX, FlexATX and BTX form factors, but is significantly smaller: 170 mm (6.7 inches) square. Mini-ITX boards can often be passively cooled due to their low power consumption architecture, which makes them useful for home theater systems, where fan noise can detract from the cinema experience.

History.

In March 2001, VIA (a chipset manufacturer) released a reference design for an ITX motherboard, to promote the low power C3 they had bought from Cyrix, in combination with their chipsets. Designed by Robert Kuo, VIA's chief R&D expert, the 215 mm x 191 mm VT6009 ITX Reference Board was demonstrated in "Information PC" and set-top box form factors. He would later go on to design the Mini-ITX form factor. The ITX form factor was never taken up by manufacturers, who instead produced smaller boards based on the very similar 229 mm x 191 mm FlexATX form factor.

In October 2001, VIA announced their decision to create a new motherboard division, to provide standardised infrastructure for lower-cost PC form factors and focus on embedded devices. The result was the November 2001 release of the VT6010 Mini-ITX reference design, once again touted as an "Information PC", or low cost entry level x86 computing platform. Manufacturers were still reticent, but customer response was much more receptive, so VIA decided to manufacture and sell the boards themselves. In April 2002 the first Mini-ITX motherboards - VIA's EPIA 5000 (fanless 533 MHz Eden processor) and EPIA 800 (800 MHz C3) - were sold to industrial customers.

Enthusiasts soon noticed the advantages of small size, low noise and power consumption, and started to push the boundaries of case modding into something else - building computers into nearly every object imaginable, and sometimes even creating new cases altogether. Hollowed out vintage computers, humidors, toys, electronics, musical instruments, and even a 1960s-era toaster have become homes to relatively quiet, or even silent Mini-ITX systems, capable of many of the tasks of a modern desktop PC.

Mini-ITX boards are still primarily industrial boards, with the majority sold in bulk for less exciting applications. They are produced with a much longer sales lifetime than consumer boards (the original EPIAs are still available), something that industrial users need. Manufacturers can prototype using standard cases and power supplies, then build their own enclosures if volumes get high enough. Typical applications include playing music in supermarkets and advertising display boards.

To date there have been three generations of VIA's Mini-ITX boards, the original PL133 chipset boards (affectionately known as "Classic" boards), CLE266 chipset boards (adding MPEG-2 acceleration), and CN400 boards (which added MPEG-4 acceleration). Second generation boards include the EPIA M, MII, CL, PD, TC and MS - all tailored to slightly different markets. The EPIA SP is the first CN400 board to be released to date. All current VIA boards use their x86-compatible CPU - the C3, or its lower power Eden variant. In 2006 the next generation C7 CPU was released in new line of VIA boards. Other manufacturers have also produced boards using the same form-factor, using VIA, but also Intel, AMD, Transmeta and PowerPC technology.

Roscoe Tanner (born October 15, 1951) was a professional American male tennis player and World No. 4 in 1979. He was born in Chattanooga and with Sandy Mayer helped to lead Stanford University's rise to the number 1 spot in collegiate tennis in 1973.  Tanner played number one singles, with Mayer playing number two.  The team also featured Rick Fisher, Stanley Pasarell, Jim Delaney, James "Chico" Hagey, Gery Groslimond, Pat DuPre, and Paul Sidone.  Tanner is best remembered for his devastating left-handed serve, his victory at the 1977 Australian Open (January) and 5-set loss to Björn Borg in the 1979 Wimbledon finals. 

Of the winning 1973 Stanford tennis team, Tanner, Mayer and DuPre were all brothers in the Zeta Psi fraternity.

Since retiring from the ATP Tour, Tanner has run into a fair amount of legal trouble with women as well as financial problems, he moved to Germany (Ettlingen) with his wife and daughters:

 Divorcing his wife.
 Divorcing his second wife.
 Impregnating a woman from an escort service.
 Marrying a third wife.
 Writing a bad cheque to buy a $35,595 boat then getting a $10,000 loan with the boat as collateral. The boat was later repossessed after being returned to the owner.
 Spending ten months in jail in Germany, Florida and New Jersey for failing to pay child support and an outstanding debt.

He was arrested while on the court of a tennis tournament in Germany; and then, he was extradited to Florida on charges of passing a bad check, and was wanted in New Jersey due to owing $500,000 in back child support.  In 2005, Orange County (CA) authorities put out a warrant for his arrest after he failed to show up for a child support hearing. 

In 2005 he co-wrote his autobiography, "Double Fault: My Rise And Fall, And My Road Back".

On January 17, 2006, Tanner was sentenced to two years in prison for violating terms of his probation related to his grand theft conviction for failing to pay the $35,595 check he used to buy a 32-foot boat in 2000.

After serving one year of his two year sentence in a Florida prison, Tanner was released February 1, 2007 after credit for "good behavior".  He was then transfered to the Orange County, California jail where he is currently being held for Criminal Contempt of Court and Failure to Pay Child Support.  The California warrants were issued in mid-1995, and the authorities there had tracked Tanner through several states and European countries before his arrest.  His bond is currently set at $100,000 on these charges.

The A1000 is a main road in the United Kingdom, running north from Highgate, North London for approximately 20 miles to Welwyn where it joins the A1(M) motorway. It incorporates part of the main medieval route out of London, and runs through Finchley, Whetstone, Chipping Barnet and Monken Hadley. After leaving Greater London, it passes through Potters Bar, then it skirts Brookmans Park and Welham Green before entering Hatfield, after the A1001 road has split. It finally runs through Welwyn Garden City before reaching Welwyn. It was formerly known as the Great North Road (and parts of it still bear this name), or A1, but after a bypass was built in the 1920s it became the A1000.

<doc id="7803345" title="Doctrine of mental reservation" nonfiltered="1463" processed="1442" dbindex="1481478">
The doctrine of mental reservation, or the doctrine of mental equivocation, was a special branch of casuistry developed in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and most often associated with the Jesuits and their resistance against the Protestant Reformation.

The doctrine of mentalis restrictio or mental reservation was most fully enunciated by the late-16th-century religious writer Dr. Martin de Azpilcueta, known as Dr. Navarrus after his home country. Navarrus held that mental reservation involved truths "expressed partly in speech and partly in the mind," relying upon the idea that God hears what is in one's mind while human beings hear only what one speaks. Therefore the Christian's moral duty was to tell the truth to God. Reserving some of that truth from the ears of human hearers was moral if it served a greater good. The user of the doctrine could reply "I know not" aloud to a human interlocutor, and "to tell you" silently to God, and still be telling the truth. 

The doctrine of mental reservation was intimately linked with the concept of equivocation, which allowed the speaker to employ double meanings of words to tell the literal truth while concealing a deeper meaning. Navarrus did not by any means originate these ideas, but he gave them a far more broad and liberal interpretation than had anyone up to that time. Other Catholic theological thinkers and writers took up the argument in favor of equivocation and mental reservation. Though the concepts remained controversial within the Roman Catholic Church (which never officially endorsed or upheld the doctrines), the Jesuits came to favor these tactics for their obvious advantages.

The linked doctrines of mental reservation and equivocation became notorious in England during the Elizabethan era and the Jacobean era, when Jesuit agents penetrating England to maintain the Catholic cause were captured by the authorities, and used these concepts in their legal defenses. Robert Southwell (ca. 1561 1595), a Jesuit priest and agent (also a poet of note) who was arrested in England in 1592, defended the doctrines at his trial, to the predictable resistance of the authorities. (Southwell was convicted, and executed in 1595.) More famous in his own era was Henry Garnet (1555 1606), who wrote a defense of Southwell in 1598; Garnet was captured by the authorities in 1606 due to his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot. He used the same doctrines in his own defense, with the same result as Southwell: Garnet was executed that year.

The Protestants considered these doctrines as mere justifications for lies. And the doctrines have generally not stood up to the  critical examination of ethicists, philosophers, and legal scholars.

<doc id="980125" title="Salento" nonfiltered="1466" processed="1445" dbindex="1481481">



Salento (Salentu in dialect) is the south-eastern extremity of the Apulia region of Italy. It is a sub-peninsula of the main Italian peninsula, sometimes described as the "heel" of the Italian "boot". It encompasses the administrative areas of Brindisi, Lecce and Taranto provinces. 
The peninsula is also known as Terra d'Otranto, and in ancient times was called variously  Messapia, Calabria, and Salentina.

Geographic perspective.
Salento peninsula is a  rock of limestone dividing the Adriatic Sea from the Ionian Sea. 
Known also as "peninsula salentina," from a geo-morphologic point of view it encompasses the land borders between Ionian sea and the Adriatic sea to  the  messapic threshold , a depression that runs along the Taranto-Ostuni line and separates it from the Murge. Its borders are: 
   
 Taranto, in the omonimous province;   ;
 Pilone, in the territory of Ostuni (province of Brindisi),   ;
 Santa Maria di Leuca, in province of Lecce.   ;

Culture.
Salento, from a cultural and linguistic point of view, does not include the city of Taranto (where the tarantino dialect is spoken), nor the rest of Taranto province to the west of the city (where pugliese -apulian is the dialect generally spoken), nor the rest of the province of Brindisi to north of Ostuni (where the accent is influenced by the dialect of Bari). Beside these borders, the language can be defined generally as  pugliese  (apulian), pertaining to  the southern  tipology. To the south and east, the Griko and Salentin dialect are spoken, pertaining to the  extreme  southern tipology and more similar to the Sicilian or Calabrian languages.

Tourism.
A number of places, the coasts above all, are remarkable landscapes and environments, among them the Alimini Lakes, on the Adriatic coast, and  Porto Selvaggio, on the Ionic coast. 
The soil is very fertile, some of the finest olive trees and grapes grow here, and their products are exported worldwide.
Its coasts are varied, and can be sandy or rocky, but all boast pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters.
Some of the most renowned locations in Salento for summer holidays (from May/June to September) are: Ostuni, Oria, Ugento, Manduria, Porto Cesareo, Gallipoli, Torre dell'Orso, Otranto, Santa Maria di Leuca.

Salento is a peaceful land full of history and traditions whose strong points are its natural and architectural beauties, its hospitality, its magic atmosphere, its several wonders to discover, its warm sun, its blue sky, its crystal sea and its dreamlike coast.

 How to get there .
By air: the nearest international airports are: Brindisi and Bari (this is out of Salento but not so far). No direct flight from the US (yet).
By road: there is a good 2-lanes freeway from Bari, all the way to the end of the heel-of-the-boot.
By train: main railway line ends at Lecce. Other locations are served by regional rail.
By sea: excellent leisure ports in: Taranto, Brindisi, Gallipoli, Santa Maria di Leuca, Otranto.

<doc id="5542220" title="Atlantica (trade zone)" nonfiltered="1467" processed="1446" dbindex="1481482">


Atlantica, formally known as Atlantica: the International Northeast Economic Region (AINER), is the name of a proposed area of economic integration in the Atlantic Northeast of North America, incorporating parts of Canada and the United States.

Organization.
The trade zone is promoted by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with U.S. representatives in Bangor, Maine.

Atlantica has also been promoted by the Atlantic Growth Network, also based in Halifax, with the support of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, which sponsored a 2002 conference.

A conference on these issues was held at Saint John, New Brunswick June 8-June 10, 2006.

Regional justification.
The boundaries defined by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies broadly echo the Atlantic Northeast, incorporating Upstate New York roughly north of I-90 (or the Erie Canal), Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, the island of Newfoundland, and Quebec on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The inclusion of Labrador, and thus the entirety of Newfoundland and Labrador, is unsettled. Some organization maps also include the region of Quebec directly south of Labrador, but this has not been elaborated on.

The proponents of Atlantica believe this region has common geography, demographics, economics, and environment. This concept of a cross-border continuity is discussed in regional studies such as the influential 1981 book The Nine Nations of North America.  In particular, proponents believe that the region has seen declining political influence in both countries, and would do well to pool its resources. 

Supporters believe that state, provincial, and international borders, as well as tariffs and regulatory differences, disrupt the economic potential of the region, and that a common strategy would maximize the region's opportunities in the globalization era. The goal of the institute seems to be further reduction of tariff and regulatory barriers under NAFTA and development of cross-border infrastructure to facilitate shipping. The benefit to New England is access to the port of Halifax, while the benefit to the Atlantic provinces is direct overland access to U.S. markets.

Opposition.
Opponents of the nascent Atlantica project see it having a neo-liberal agenda that would harm worker pay and rights, benefit corporations at the expense of consumers, and undermine social services through reduced taxation.  Protesters were seen at the June 2006 conference.

<doc id="611752" title="Ravioli" nonfiltered="1472" processed="1451" dbindex="1481487">


Ravioli are a popular type of pasta, comprised of a filling, commonly (though not always) meat based, sealed between two layers of pasta dough. Ravioli are commonly rectangular or circular in shape.

A common vegetarian option includes ricotta cheese and vegetables such as spinach or nettles in place of meat. The filling could be also potatoes, squash or even tofu.  Though often topped with a red, tomato based sauce, the sauces are as varied as the fillings.  Pesto, broth based and cream based sauces are also common.

Additionally, other ravioli varieties, like Chocolate Ravioli, have appeared to fill a dessert role.

The word ravioli derives from ravvolgere, the verb meaning "to wrap." Stuffed pasta was probably introduced in the Medieval period in Europe. Pasta was stuffed with meat, fish and vegetables, and could include a creamy cheese like ricotta. Tomato sauce would not have been used, since tomatoes were not introduced in Europe until the 15th century.  

In Italy, most regions have their own versions of ravioli, and some of the earliest mentions of the dish come from the personal letters of Francisco di Marco, a merchant of Prato in the 14th century. Though the dish is of Italian origin the oldest known recipe is an Anglo-Norman vellum manuscript from the 1290s.

Today one can find packed refrigerated or frozen ravioli across the world, especially where Italian communities have a certain relief. Ravioli are made in special industrial lines supplied, all over the world, by Italian companies such as Arienti & Cattaneo, Ima, Ostoni, Zamboni, etc.; "fresh" packed ravioli have usually seven weeks of shelf-life.

In Lebanon and Palestine, this dish is called Shish Barak(Shishbarak), the same pasta filled with minced beef meat and cooked in hot yogurt.

Other cultures have parallels to ravioli.  The Chinese jiaozi or wonton (indeed in Chinese ravioli and tortellini collectively are called "Italian jiaozi" (    ) or "Italian wonton" (     )), the Russian pelmeni, the Ukrainian varenyky, the Tibetan momo and Jewish kreplachs are a few examples.

<doc id="1460540" title="Sands Hotel" nonfiltered="1475" processed="1454" dbindex="1481490">

The Sands Hotel was a legendary Las Vegas, Nevada hotel/casino that operated from December 15, 1952 to June 30, 1996.  It was the seventh resort that opened on the Las Vegas Strip. It was designed by architect Wayne McAllister. 

During its heyday, the Sands would be the center of entertainment and cool on the Strip, and hosted many famous entertainers of the day.  Regulars would be able to mingle with the stars in the lounge after their late-night shows.  Even most of the Presidents, Senators, and Congress people stayed at the Sands when they were in town.

In its final years, the Sands became a shadow of its former self; a throwback to the old days, and it ultimately could not compete with the newer and more exciting megaresorts that were being built on the Strip.  The decision was eventually made by its final owner, Sheldon Adelson, to shut it down and to build a brand new resort. On November 26, 1996, it was imploded and demolished much to the dismay of longtime employees and sentimentalists. The Las Vegas scenes of Con Air were filmed at the Sands prior to its demolition.

Today, the Venetian now stands where the Sands once stood.

 History .

The hotel first began as just a casino with a few hundred rooms. 

The hotel was designed by architect Wayne McAllister. It was founded by Jakie Friedman of Houston, Texas, grandfather of Houston socialite Carolyn Farb. 

Its most famous claim to fame was a 3-week period in 1960 when, during the filming of the movie Ocean's Eleven, they organized an event in the Copa Room called the  Summit at the Sands , where for the first time Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford performed on stage together.  They would forever be known after that as the Rat Pack.  Sinatra would also own a stake in the Sands for a time.

The circular tower was added in 1967 by architect Martin Stern, Jr.

When billionaire Howard Hughes purchased the hotel in the mid-1960s, a 500-room tower was added and the hotel became a Vegas landmark. Kirk Kerkorian (MGM) bought the hotel in 1988, and seven months later in 1989 it was purchased by the owners of The Interface Group - Sheldon Adelson, Richard Katzeff, Ted Cutler, Irwin Chafetz, and Jordan Shapiro.

 Film History .

The 1960 version of Ocean's Eleven was filmed here. Footage of the demolition also appeared in the closing credits of The Cooler.

 Musical legacy .

Frank Sinatra (Sinatra at the Sands with Count Basie), Sammy Davis, Jr. (The Sounds of '66), Tommy Sands, and Count Basie were among those who recorded live albums at the Sands.

Vernacular photography refers to the creation of photographs by amateur or unknown photographers who take everyday life and common things as subjects. Examples of vernacular photographs include travel and vacation photos, family snapshots, photos of friends, class portraits, identification photographs, and photobooth images. Vernacular photographs are a type of accidental art. The photos taken by the common man that have uncommon qualities to them. 

Closely related to vernacular photography is "found photography," which in on one sense refers to the recovery of a "lost" or unclaimed or discarded vernacular photograph. Found photos can be "found" at flea markets, thrift stores, yard sales, estate sales, in dumpsters and trash cans, between the pages of books or on sidewalks.

Also, the use of vernacular photography in the arts is almost as old as photography itself. Vernacular photography has become far more commonplace in recent years as an art technique and is now a widely accepted genre of art photography. Artists who have made extensive use of vernacular photography in their work include Stephen Bull, Dick Jewell, Patrick McCoy, and Joachim Schmid.

Vernacular photographs also have become popular with art collectors and for collectors of found photographs.

It is an autonomous division of the Dutch Ministry of Justice and resorts under the Directorate-General for Law Enforcement.

History.

On July 30 1945 the government decided to install a  Justice Laboratory. Three years later, November 4, 1948, the laboratory became a department on its own in the Ministry of Justice.

In 1951 a similar institute was founded: Gerechtelijk Geneeskundig Laboratorium (Judicial Medical Laboratory), which was later renamed Laboratorium voor Gerechtelijke Pathologie Laboratory for Judicial Pathology.

Pathologist dr. Jan Zeldenrust was the first CEO of this laboratory.

Tecmo NBA Basketball is a multiplatform basketball game that combines real time action with cinema-style cutscenes like in a basketball movie. The quality of graphics is similar to Tecmo Super Bowl, although they deal in two different sports. There is an option to play an all-star game, with an option to edit the players on that team. For example, you can have Charles Oakley on the All-Star East team.

The game is notable for having featured a rare appearance from Michael Jordan in a video game and featured all current NBA teams and players from the 1991-1992 NBA Season. Other famous NBA players who are in this game include Larry Bird (in his final year) and Magic Johnson (also in his final year).

<doc id="621391" title="Philip Jaisohn" nonfiltered="1485" processed="1464" dbindex="1481500">

Philip Jaisohn is the anglicized name used by Seo Jae Pil, a noted activist for Korea's independence during the Japanese occupation, and the first Korean to become a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Birth and early political activity.
Philip Jaisohn was born in 1864 as the second son of a county magistrate in Boseong in southwestern Korea.  He passed the civil service exam and became a junior official in 1882.  In the following year, he was sent to Japan where he studied at both the Keio Gijuku (the forerunner of the Keio University) and at the Toyama Army Academy for two years.  

After returning to Korea in 1884, he was involved, along with Kim Ok-kyun and others, in the Gapsin coup d'état to overturn the old regime and was appointed as the Minister of Defence by the revolutionaries.  The revolution, however, was toppled within three days, as China intervened with military forces, and Seo was forced to an exile in Japan, and later, in the United States.

Life in the United States.
In the United States, he began to use the anglicized name "Philip Jaisohn" while attending the Harry Hillman Academy. In 1890 he was the first Korean to become a naturalized citizen of the United States. This was unusual at the time since American law at the time stated citizenship was only available to the white race. Later he studied medicine at the Columbian Medical College (later George Washington University Medical School), receiving the medical degree in 1892 (the first Korean to receive a degree from a medical institution). In 1894, he married Muriel Armstrong, a niece of the former president of the United States, James Buchanan.  

In 1896, the plotters of 1884 were pardoned and Seo/Jaisohn returned to Korea at the invitation of Park Young Hyo, another former conspirator of Kapsin Coup, who had just been appointed Prime Minister to serve as an advisor to the Korean government.  In Seoul, he founded the Independence Club (    ) and published a newspaper, The Independence (    ), to promote national independence and the diffusion of liberal democracy.  His newspaper, in particular, was the first civilian newspaper in Korean--other Korean newspapers continued to use significant numbers of Chinese characters for decades. 
The Independence Club was particularly critical of corruption or misconduct of members of governmental officials, a fact that earned the organization much displeasure from the official quarters.  The government in 1898 accused the Club of seeking to overthrow the monarchy and establish a Republic.  Following the arrest of seventeen of its leaders in late 1898, the organization was formally ordered disbanded on December 25 1899.  He was forced to return to the United States once again. The fact he was an American citizen probably saved his life at this time.

Later life.
Back in the United States, he both practiced medicine and became a successful businessman in Philadelphia.  He was also involved in medical research and published a number of articles in specialized medical journals. Following the formal annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910, Jaisohn collaborated with various Korean exiles in United States to help advance the cause of Korean independence, organizing, among others, the organization called the League of Friends of Korea in 1920. 

He would return to Korea once again after Japan's defeat in World War II, as the American military government in control of what would become South Korea invited him as an advisor in 1947. He felt uneasy about the country's gradual slide towards Syngman Rhee's dictatorship, but the chaotic conditions in Korea combined with his advanced age, made it difficult for him to achieve much. Disappointed, he returned to the United States where he died in January 1951.

This house was acquired by the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation in 1987 and opened as a museum to the public in 1990. Since then, the Jaisohn House was visited by many students, guests from Korea and community residents, including South Korean President and Nobel peace laureat Kim Dae Jung in 1999. 

On May 21 1994 the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation dedicated a historical marker for Dr. Jaisohn, stating: 
"American-educated medical doctor who sowed seeds of democracy in Korea, published its first modern newspaper (1896-98), and popularized its written language. The first Korean to earn a Western medical degree and become a U.S. citizen. He worked for Korean independence during the Japanese occupation, 1910-45. Chief Advisor to the U.S. Military Government in Korea, 1947-1948. This was his home for 25 years." 

The Jaisohn House is located in Media, Pennsylvania.

Charles Pearson (October 1793 - September 1862) was Solicitor to the City of London and an early promoter of the need for an underground railway in central London.

Pearson was born in the City of London, the son of an upholsterer and feather merchant. He qualified as a solicitor in 1816 and shortly afterwards was elected as a councilman of the Corporation of London. He became City Solicitor in 1839 and held the office until his death.

Despite his comfortable upbringing and his social status, Pearson was something of a radical and throughout his life he fought a number of campaigns on progressive and reforming issues including the removal from the Monument of the inscription blaming the Great Fire of London on Catholics and the overturning of the ban on Jews becoming brokers in the City.

Campaigning for an underground railway.

Recognising the increasing congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, in 1845 Pearson published a pamphlet calling for the construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although this proposal came to nothing (and would almost certainly have been a failure if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s including a central railway station for London akin to Grand Central Terminal later built in New York.

In 1854 a Royal Commission was set-up to examine a number of new proposals for railways in London. Pearson made a proposal for a railway connecting the London Terminii and presented as evidence the first survey of traffic coming into London which demonstrated the high level of congestion caused by the huge number of carts, cabs and omnibuses filling the roads. Many of the proposed schemes were rejected but the Commission did recommend that a railway be constructed linking the terminii with the Docks and the General Post Office. A parliamentary bill for a railway between Praed Street in Paddington and Farringdon received assent in 1854 establishing the Metropolitan Railway.

Although not a director or significant shareholder of the new company, Pearson continued to promote the project over the next few years and use his influence to help the company raise the capital needed for the construction of the line. He even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. 

By 1860 the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets. 

Pearson died in September 1862 and did not live to see the opening of the Metropolitan Railway on 10 January 1863. In recognition of his role in lobbying for the railway, a grateful company gave Pearson's widow an annuity of £250 per year.

<doc id="1454083" title="History of rail transport in Australia" nonfiltered="1490" processed="1469" dbindex="1481505">
This article is part of the history of rail transport by country series;

Following the British model, Australians generally assumed in the 1850s that railways would be built by the private sector.  Private companies attempted to build railways in the colonies (states after Federation in 1901) of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The first line opened in South Australia in 1854 as a horse-drawn line, while the first steam-powered line opened in Victoria a little later in 1854.  It was soon established that the private railways were not financially viable, and the building of rail networks was taken over by colonial governments.  This also enabled railways to be developed to promote development, even if not apparently viable in strictly financial terms.  The railway systems spread from the colonial capitals, except in cases where geography dictated a choice of an alternate port.

The colonial railways were built to three different gauges, which became a problem once lines of different systems met at Albury, New South Wales in 1881 and Wallangarra, Queensland in 1888.  In the 20th Century, the lines between major cities were converted to standard gauge and electrified suburban networks were built in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.  In the second half of the 20th Century, many rural branch lines were closed to passengers or altogether in all states.  On the other hand, long heavy-haul railways were built to transport iron ore in Western Australia and coal in Queensland to ports.
The development of the State networks.


Australia's first steam-powered railway was a suburban line opened from Melbourne to Port Melbourne in 1854.  This line and almost all subsequent Victorian lines were built to broad gauge (1600 mm, 5' 3", gauge).  In the following year New South Wales opened its first line standard gauge (1435mm, 4' 8 ") from Sydney to Granville in what is now Sydney's western suburbs.  In the following year South Australia opened its first line (1600 mm gauge) from Adelaide to Port Adelaide.  The three major Australian colonies at the time failed to follow advice from the British Government to adopt a uniform gauge in case the lines of the various states should ever meet.  The original Irish engineer persuaded the New South Wales legislature to require that all railways in the colony be of the Irish broad gauge.  Subsequently a Scots engineer persuaded the legislature to change to standard gauge. Unfortunately Victoria and South Australia had ordered broad gauge rolling-stock and refused to follow this change.  

Queensland first line (1067 mm, 3' 6" feet gauge   known in Australia as "narrow gauge") from Ipswich to Bigges Camp, the first stage of a railway between Brisbane and Toowoomba, opened in 1865.  This gauge was intended to save money and was subsequently followed by Tasmania and Western Australia.  As a result, in the middle of the 20th century Australia had almost equal amounts of each gauge.  Tasmania's first (1600 mm gauge) line opened in 1871 from Deloraine to Launceston and was converted to 1067 mm gauge in 1888.  Finally, Western Australia opened its first Government-owned line in 1879 between Geraldton and Northampton.  Lines spread in all the states from these first lines, connecting ports to farmland and ports.

The mainline systems of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland met (albeit with three breaks of gauge) in the 1880s.  Only Victoria and South Australia shared a common gauge, and even so they opted to change engines at the border.  The other mainland colony, Western Australia, was isolated by 2,000 km of desert.
The first break of gauge was created when the New South Wales and Victorian lines met at Albury in 1883.  The railways of  Victoria and South Australia meet at Serviceton in 1887, but these lines were both broad gauge.  In 1888 the railways of New South Wales and Queensland meet at Wallangara.  Meanwhile, in 1889, the first line (1067 mm gauge) in the Northern Territory was opened  from Darwin to Pine Creek.  In 1915, a seven  kilometre extension of the New South Railways from Queanbeyan to Canberra to  create the Australian Capital Territory's first and only line.  
New South Wales.


New South Wales' railways were standard gauge lines built to connect the ports of Sydney and Newcastle to the rural interior.  The first railway was built from Sydney to Parramatta Junction and after two decisions to change the rail gauge, problems in raising capital and difficulties in construction, the line was opened in 1854.  The Main Southern line was built in stages from Parramatta Junction to the Victorian border at Albury between 1855 and 1881 and connected to the Victorian Railways at a break-of-gauge in 1883.  The standard gauge connection from Albury to Melbourne was finally completed in 1962.  Meanwhile, the Main Western line was built from Parramatta Junction line to the north west of the state, reaching Bourke between 1860 and 1885.  

The Main North line was built from Newcastle to Wallangarra on the Queensland border and connecting with Queensland Railway's line to Brisbane at a break of gauge between 1857 and 1888.  Sydney and Newcastle was finally connected in 1889.  The shorter and single-gauge North Coast railway line between Sydney and Brisbane was completed between 1905 and 1932.  

The last main line, the Broken Hill line was completed to Broken Hill in 1927, connecting with the South Australian Railways at a break of gauge.  In 1970, the South Australian section was standardised, completing the Sydney - Perth standard gauge link.  Meanwhile branch lines proliferated over the settled east of the state, including the Illawarra  line to Wollongong and Nowra completed in 1893. In 1926 work began on electrifying Sydney's urban railways and connecting them together via new lines.

Victoria.

 

Victoria's first railway was a suburban railway opened by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company from Melbourne to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) in 1854.  This line and almost all subsequent lines were built to broad gauge (1600 mm).  The Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company's line from Princes Bridge railway station to Punt Road (Richmond) opened in 1859.  In the same year the  Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company opened its line from Melbourne to Geelong. 

Subsequently, up to 1925, Victorian Railways built new railways to connect farming and mining communities to the ports of Melbourne, Geelong and Portland.  In 1862 lines reaches the great gold rush towns of Bendigo and Ballarat.  In 1864 a line was opened to the Murray River port of Echuca.  In 1883 the first connection with another State's rail system was made when a line was completed to the New South Wales Government Railways's station at Albury, requiring a break-of-gauge to New South Wales's standard gauge (1435mm).  In 1887, Victorian Railways met South Australian Railways at Serviceton, although both systems used broad gauge.  In 1888 the Gippsland line reached Bairnsdale.  The next year a direct line from Melbourne to Ballarat opened, avoiding Geelong.  In the early 20th century rural lines were completed to Mildura (1903) and Tocumwal (1908).

In 1919, electrification and development of the Melbourne suburban lines commenced.  In 1981, Melbourne's only underground railway, the Melbourne City Loop was opened.  The main interstate links were finally standardised:  Melbourne to Albury (connecting to Sydney) in 1961 and Melbourne to Adelaide in 1995.

Queensland.

The first line opened in 1865 from Ipswich to Grandchester, a temporary terminus in the foothills of the Darling Downs.    It was built to narrow  gauge (1067mm   3' 6") in order to reduce costs through the steep escarpment..  This was subsequently applied to all the railways built in Queensland, except for the Brisbane-Sydney standard gauge line and the Weipa mining railway, both built in the 20th century.   This was the first 1067mm railway in the world, but the gauge subsequently spread to Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Japan, Indonesia, Southern Africa, Nigeria and Ghana among others.  The line was extended from Grandchester to Toowoomba at the top of a steep climb in 1867 and was connected from Ipswich to Brisbane in 1876.  From Toowoomba it was extended in stages to meet the New South Wales standard gauge line at Wallangarra in 1887 and to Charleville in outback southern Queensland in 1888.  

Independent lines were commenced from the east coast ports of Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, Cairns and Cooktown.  The central line opened from Rockhampton to Westwood in 1887 and reached Winton in central western Queensland in 1928.  The northern line opened from Townsville to Charters Towers in 1882 and reached Mount Isa in 1929.

In 1888 the east-west lines began to be connected with the opening of the first section of the North Coast line to Petrie.  It was not until 1924 that this line finally reached Cairns   Cooktown was never connected.

The interstate standard gauge line completed as far as Grafton, New South Wales in 1930  and Sydney in 1932.  A mixed-gauge freight-only branch of this line was opened to the Port of Brisbane in 1995.

Many heavy haul coal lines were built in the late 20th century from the ports of Gladstone (beginning in 1968) and Hay Point (beginning in 1971).  Electrification of some of the heavy haul coal lines commenced in 1986.

Finally an electrified rail system was developed in suburban Brisbane from 1979.  Eventually the the North Coast line between Brisbane and Rockhampton was electrified.  This, together with the central Queensland mining railway, constitutes Australia's only significant rural rail electrification

Western Australia.


The first railway in Western Australia was a private timber railway opens from Lockville to Yoganup, south of Perth.  In 1879, Western Australian Government Railways opened a 1067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge to connect the copper mine at Northampton and the port of Geraldton.  Subsequently lines also developed from the ports of Fremantle (the port of Perth), Bunbury, Albany and Esperance, mainly for carrying grain and minerals. 
 
The line between Fremantle, Perth and Guildford (about 15km further east) was opened in 1881.  In 1893, Perth was connected to the port of Bunbury, 175 kilometres south of Perth.  In the following year the Midland Railway Company opened a line from Perth to Walkaway, which connected with the Government line to Geraldton, 424 km north of Perth.  In 1896, the railway connected Perth to Kalgoorlie, where gold had been discovered in 1893. 

In the 20th century, Perth was finally connected to the eastern states.  In 1917, the standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway connected eastern Australia  with the narrow gauge network at Kalgoorlie.  In 1966, a new mixed standard and narrow gauge Eastern Railway route was completed through the Avon Valley, east of Perth.  Finally, in 1968, the Kalgoorlie to Perth standard gauge line was opened.
  
The rationalisation of non-paying branch lines started in 1957, with the closure of many lines.

Commencing in the 1960s, a number of long distance heavy-haul railways have been built in the Pilbara region by major iron mining companies, particularly BHP Billiton and  Hamersley Iron.  New lines are still being built in this area, particularly to supply the booming Chinese market. 

In 1986, the electrification of Perth suburban lines with a 25 kV AC overhead power supply commenced.  The longest new line is currently under construction to Mandurah and is due to be opened in July 2007.

South Australia.


South Australia was the first colony in Australia to build a railway line. It was a horse-drawn tramway from the port of Goolwa on the Murray River to an ocean harbour at Port Elliot in 1854. It was later extended to a safer harbour at Victor Harbor.  The first South Australian steam-operated line was built as a broad gauge (1600 mm) line in 1856 between the city and Port Adelaide stopping at Bowden, Woodville and Alberton.  Gradually, a network of lines spread out from Adelaide, Port Wakefield, Wallaroo, Port Broughton, Port Augusta, Kingston SE, Beachport, Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Lincoln.  Some of these were built initially to carry ore, particularly copper.  They later carried freight from the Murray River and grain from the broadacre lands.

All but the lines radiating from Adelaide were initially narrow (1067 mm) gauge lines.  The first narrow  gauge line was completed in 1870 from Port Wakefield to Hoyleton.

The first interstate connection was completed in 1887, when the South Australian and Victorian broad gauge railways met at Serviceton, Victoria.  In  1888 a narrow gauge line was opened from Port Pirie to Broken Hill, New South Wales, with a connection at Peterborough to Adelaide.  In 1927, this became an interstate link with the opening of the final leg of the Sydney - Broken Hill standard gauge line between Trida and Menindee.

The broad gauge line was completed from Adelaide to Terowie in 1880.  The line north of Terowie was built as a narrow gauge line in stages to Peterborough in 1881, Quorn in 1882 and Oodnadatta in 1891.  This was extended to Alice Springs by Commonwealth Railways in 1929, when it was renamed the Central Australia Railway.  

The first standard gauge line in South Australia, Trans-Australian Railway, was completed in 1917 between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, requiring break-of-gauges at Terowie, Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie to reach Perth.  This line was extended to Port Pirie in 1937 and the broad gauge line from Adelaide to Redhill was extended to Port Pirie, removing one break-of gauge.  In 1970 the Port Pirie to Broken Hill standard gauge line was opened, completing the Sydney - Perth link.  In 1982 Adelaide was connected to the standard gauge network at  Crystal Brook, South Australia, near Port Pirie.

Meanwhile in 1980 the Tarcoola, South Australia to Alice Springs standard gauge railway was opened, replacing the narrow gauge line via Oodnadatta.  It was extended to Darwin in 2003.  In 1995 the Adelaide to Melbourne standard gauge railway was opened, completing the connections between the mainland capitals.

Tasmania.


The first railway in Tasmania was a broad gauge (1600 mm) line opened between Deloraine and Launceston in 1871 by the Launceston and Western Railway.  It quickly went bankrupt and was effectively teken over by the Tasmanian Government in 1872. In 1876 the Tasmanian Main Line Company opened a narrow gauge (1067 mm) line from Hobart to Evandale (near Launceston), connecting with an extension of the Launceston and Western line at a break-of-gauge.  Further gauge confusion was added in 1885 when the Tasmanian Government built a narrow gauge line west of Deloraine to Devonport.  This was resolved in 1888 by the conversion of the Launceston Deloraine line to narrow gauge. 

The Tasmanian Government bought the Tasmanian Main Line Company in 1890, creating the Tasmanian Government Railways.  In 1901 the line to Devonport line was extended to Burnie, connecting with the Emu Bay Railway's line to Zeehan.  Other branches were built but the Tasmanian system has always been small and unprofitable.  It currently carries no regular passenger services and its freight services are not profitable without subsidies for the maintenance and upgrading of its infrastructure, which is currently controlled by Pacific National.
Off network gauges.
Off the networks constructed by the various government railways, there have been a variety of rail gauges:
 Cane tramways, mainly in Queensland are 2' 0", but these carry very little through traffic so that the break-of-gauge is not a problem.
 Victoria had four short 2' 6" lines for general traffic;
 Private timber tramways used a variety of gauges;
 Private, isolated and heavy duty iron ore mining railways all use the standard gauge of 4' 8 ";
 Temporary lines at construction sites, such as the 3' 6" gauge railways used for the development of the national capital at Canberra between 1913 and 1927, including the original Parliament House;

 Development of the national network .
In the 19th Century, railways were created to enable agricultural and minerals traffic to be carried to ports for export, and to allow passenger and freight operations between colonial capitals and regional areas.  Coastal shipping handled most passenger and freight traffic between the colonies.  However, the problem of different gauges became apparent with the meeting of lines of the different systems at Albury in 1881 and Wallangarra in 1888.  

In the 1890s, the establishment of an Australian Federation from the six colonies was debated. One of the points of discussion was the extent that railways would be a federal responsibility. A vote to make it so was lost narrowly, instead the new constitution allows "the acquisition, with the consent of a State, of any railways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State" (Section 51 xxxiii) and "railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of that State" (Section 51 xxxiv).  However, the Australian Government is free to provide funding to the states for rail upgrading projects under Section 96 ("the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit").  

The Australian Government has full responsibility for railways in the federal territories, although the Northern Territory's railway is now owned and operated by the private AustralAsia Rail Corporation and the only railway in the Australian Capital Territory, the Canberra-Queanbeyan railway is now operated by the Rail Corporation New South Wales. 

In 1910, a conference of Railway commissioners chose 4' 8 " to be the standard gauge.  Over the decades, many plans were floated to fix the break of gauge. These failed, mainly because they were too ambitious and proposed to convert all lines, even lines of little economic value.

 Creating a standard gauge network .
In the 20th century, the different state rail systems became more integrated, initially creating more breaks of gauge.  In 1917, the Federal Goverment's standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway was completed between Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and Port Augusta, South Australia.  However, this required a break of gauge at Kalgoorlie to reach Perth and breaks of gauge at both Port Augusta and and Terowie to reach Adelaide.  In 1927, the last section of the Sydney Broken Hill line was completed meeting the South Australian Railways line at a break of gauge and requiring a further break of gauge at Terowie to reach Adelaide.  

In 1932 the first progress in reducing the gauge conflict was made with the completion of the standard gauge North Coast line from Sydney to Brisbane with the opening of a bridge at Grafton.  In 1937 the Trans-Australian Railway was extended to Port Pirie and the broad gauge railway from Adelaide to Redhill was extended to Port Pirie, reducing one break of gauge between Adelaide and Perth, but creating a three-gauge railway station, until the standadisation of the line to Broken Hill and the Adelaide-Crystal Brook line. 

In the 1950s, a parliamentary committee chaired by William Charles Wentworth IV recommended a much more modest and affordable plan to gauge convert the three main missing links:

 Albury (Sydney) to Melbourne - standard gauge track added parallel to broad gauge (completed 1962).
 Kalgoorlie to Perth - narrow gauge converted to standard (completed 1968).
 Broken Hill to Port Pirie - narrow gauge converted to standard (completed 1969).

A standard gauge line was built between Port Augusta and Whyalla in 1972.  In October 1980, a new standard gauge railway was completed from Tarcoola, South Australia to Alice Springs, replacing the former narrow gauge railway.  Standardisation between Adelaide and Crystal Brook, South Australia (connecting to the Sydney-Perth standard gauge line) was completed in 1982.

In 1962 the Albury to Melbourne standard gauge railway was opened, completing the standard gauge link between the two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne.  In 1968 and 1969 the Kalgoorlie to Perth and the Broken Hill to Port Pirie standard gauge railway were opened completing the Sydney Perth link.  Adelaide was connected to the standard gauge network with the opening of the line to Crystal Brook, South Australia in 1982 and the Adelaide to Melbourne line was converted to standard gauge in 1995.  Meanwhile, the Tarcoola, South Australia to Alice Springs standard gauge railway was opened in 1980 and extended to Darwin in 2004.

 Private Railways .
There have always been niches for private railways in most colonies, such as:
mining - private iron mining railways alone now account for most Austrlalian rail freight by tonnage, but private coal railways have been important since the ealy years of coal mining in the mid 19th century;
quarrying;
major factory sites, such as steel works;
temporary lines at construction sites;
agriculture, especially the sugar industry;

 Mining Railways .
Starting in the 1960s, four heavy duty railways were developed in the Pilbara region of the far north of Western Australia for the haulage of iron ore from several mines to the nearest ports.  These railways are isolated from  each other and from the national system, carrying no other traffic.

The very heavy traffic on these lines, up to 100MT per year, push wheel/rail technology to its limits, and has resulted in considerable research and development that has been of value to railways worldwide.

These iron ore railways are all 1435mm gauge, and started off using American standards for track, locomotives and wagons.

1990s and recent developments.
 Privatisation.
In 1992, the largely Federal Government-owned National Rail Corporation took over interstate rail freight operations and rail track from the Australian National Rail Commission, and commenced operations on the interstate network.  National Rail Corporation's freight operations and rolling stock (not infrastructure) were combined with the New South Wales Government-owned FreightCorp and sold to Toll Holdings and Patrick Corporation as Pacific National in 2001.  

The Australian National Rail Commission was privatised in 1997 and its interstate freight operations were sold to Pacific National.  Its Tasmanian operations and infrastructure (TasRail) were sold to Australian Transport Network Limited, which was taken over by Pacific National in 2004.  South Australian branch lines were sold to the Australian Railroad Group.  Its passenger operations were taken over by Great Southern Railway.

State freight and country passenger operations were privatised, except in Queensland.  Urban passenger trains remained in government ownership, except in Victoria, because such services are politically sensitive and these operations could not operate profitably.

New train operating companies (TOC) appeared, including wheat trains operated by wheat exporting companies.  At least one company (Chicago Rail Freight Leasing Australia) appeared to lease locomotives and rolling stock to any TOC that wanted them.  These companies include :
Australian Railroad Group ;
Southern Shorthaul Railroad;
South Spur Rail Services;
Patrick Rail Operations;
Specialised Container Transport ;
FreightLink;
Silverton Rail;

Licensing of personnel with nationally recognised credentials facilitates the transfer of those people from one state or operator to another, as traffic demands.

Separation of infrastructure and operations.
Construction and maintenance of network infrastructure were consolidated into non-profit government bodies, in the case of the interstate network and the non-urban railways of New South Wales (Australian Rail Track Corporation) and Western Australia (WestNet Rail).   This was intended to provide access to new and existing players.  

The interstate rail network of the former Australian National Railways Commission was transferred to the newly established National Rail Corporation in 1992.  This network, except for the Tarcoola-Alice Springs Line (which was transferred to the AustralAsia Rail Corporation), was in turn transferred to the Federal Government-owned Australian Rail Track Corporation in 1997.  This consists of the track from Kalgoorlie to Broken Hill and Serviceton, Victoria.  The ARTC also manages under lease the interstate standard gauge rail network in New South Wales and Victoria and has rights to sell access between Kalgoorlie and Kwinana to interstate rail operators under a wholesale access agreement with the Western Australian track owner and operator, WestNet Rail.  It also "has a working relationship with Queensland Rail about the use of the 127 kilometres of standard gauge line between the Queensland border and Fisherman Island. ARTC intends to start discussions with Queensland about leasing this track once the NSW arrangements are bedded down".  The ARTC also maintains the NSW rural branch lines under contract.

Other railways continue to be integrated, although access to their infrastructure is generally required under National Competition Policy principles agreed by the Federal, State and Territory governments:
 Queensland - Queensland Rail;
 Tasmania - Pacific National;
 Victorian non-interstate lines - Pacific National;
 South Australian non-interstate lines - Australian Railroad Group ;
Darwin-Tarcoola Railway - FreightLink;

Much maintenance of tracks were contracted out.

 Australian Government funding .
While, the Australian Government has provided substantial funding for the upgrading of roads, since the 1920s, it has not regularly funded investment in railways except for its own railway, the Commonwealth Railways, which was established in 1911 to build the standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway between Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and Port Augusta, South Australia, and to take over the 1067mm gauge railways between Port Augusta and Oodnadatta (used by the old "Ghan") and the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway.  Commonwealth Railways became part of the Australian National Railways Commission in 1975, which was privatised in 1997.  Although the Australian Government has considered the funding of railways owned by State Government to be a State responsibility, it has made loans to the States for gauge standardisation projects from the 1920s to the 1970s.  From the 1970s to 1996, the Australian Government has provided some grant funding to the States for rail projects. 

One Nation Program.

Under the Keating Government's One Nation  program:
the Adelaide to Melbourne line was converted to standard gauge in 1995.
the 1067mm gauge line to the Port of Brisbane was converted to dual 1435/1067 mm gauge and extended in parallel with the duplicated passenger line to Dutton Park.
a standard gauge link was built to the port at Fremantle, Western Australia.
new standard gauge sidings were provided at Adelaide Outer Harbor.
a separate freight line was built between Macarthur and Glenfield as the first stage of what is now known as the Southern Sydney Freight Line.  Its planned extension to the Chullora - Enfield freight line near Sefton is being bult by the Australian Rail Track Corporation with funds provided by the Australian Government under AusLink.  ;
the Sydney - Brisbane line was upgraded with longer passing loops, the replacement of wooden trestles with concrete bridges, concrete resleepering, some minor deviations and bank stabilisation.
passing loops were extended between Wodonga and Melbourne.

Alice Springs to Darwin Railway.
In 2004, the long awaited 1420 km Alice Springs to Darwin Railway was opened by the AustralAsia Rail Corporation with assistance from the Australian Government and the governments of South Australia and the Northern Territory.  The Northern Territory expects that this railway line will open up many mining ventures that would otherwise be uneconomic without a heavy duty rail line.

<doc id="3087410" title="Turbulence modeling" nonfiltered="1492" processed="1471" dbindex="1481507">
Turbulence modeling is the area of physical modeling where a simpler mathematical model than the full time dependent Navier-Stokes Equations is used to predict of the effects of turbulence.  

Joseph Boussinesq was the first practitioner of this, introducing the concept of eddy viscosity.  In this model, the additional turbulent stresses are given by augmenting the molecular viscosity with an eddy viscosity.  This can be a simple constant eddy viscosity (which works well for some free shear flows such as axisymmetric jets, 2-D jets, and mixing layers).  Later, Ludwig Prandtl introduced the additional concept of the mixing length, along with the idea of a boundary layer.  For wall-bounded turbulent flows, the eddy viscosity must vary with distance from the wall, hence the addition of the concept of a 'mixing length'.  In the simplest wall-bounded flow model, the eddy viscosity is given by the equation: 

 ;

where:

 is the von Karman constant (0.41);

 is the partial derivative of the streamwise velocity (u) with respect to the wall normal direction (y); ;

 is the distance from the wall.

This simple model is the basis for the "Law of the Wall", which is a surprisingly accurate model for wall-bounded, attached (not separated) flow fields with small pressure gradients.  

More general turbulence models have evolved over time, with most modern turbulence models given by field equations similar to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Among many others, Joseph Smagorinsky (1964) proposed a useful formula for the eddy viscosity in numerical models, based on the local derivatives of the velocity field and the local grid size:

The fundamental idea behind scalar programming is that operations apply to a single value at a time. This makes it a low-level programming model as it restricts the programmer to think and operate on the elemental constituents of data aggregates, and resorting to explicit loops of individual scalar operations to process the whole aggregates.

The outback is the remote and arid interior and north of Australia, although the term colloquially can cover any lands outside of the main urban areas.  The term "outback" is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas deemed "the bush". The outback does not officially exist within any governmental frameworks or boundaries.  Many local government shires do use the term to enhance tourist appeal for their own shire.  The outback is home to the Australian feral camel and dingoes. The Dingo fence was built to restrict dingo movements into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent.

The marginally fertile parts, mainly within the Lake Eyre Basin, are known as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle farming, on sheep stations and cattle stations which are leased from the Federal Government. Whereas these grassy areas have fairly fertile clay soils, the remainder of the outback has exceedingly infertile paleosols which cannot support fodder nutritious enough for the economic raising of stock. Although the north of Australia has high (if extremely seasonal) and fairly reliable rainfall, giving it almost all the continent's runoff, the soils there are so poor and eroded (consisting mainly of ironstone or bauxite) as to make cropping impossible even with fertilisers such as superphosphate.

Mining.
Along with agriculture, tourism and mining are the main economic activities in this vast and sparsely settled area. Due to the complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the Permian (in many areas since the Cambrian), the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminium, manganese and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, lead and zinc ores. Because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable.

 Population .
Less than 10 percent of the Australian population lives outside the urban settlements on the coastal fringes. Despite this, the outback and the history of its exploration and settlement provides Australians with a mythical backdrop, and stories of swagmen, squatters, outlaws such as Ned Kelly (though Ned Kelly spent virtually all his time in the relatively temperate Great Dividing Range) and so on are central to the national ethos of the country. The song Waltzing Matilda, which is about swagmen and squatters, is a popular traditional Australian song.


Medicine in the outback.
Due to the wide expanses and remoteness of people in the outback, The Flying Doctor Service exists.  This service was created in 1928 in Cloncurry, Queensland.  The aim of the service is to provide medical care, primary and emergency, to people who cannot reach hospitals or general practitioners.  Consultations are carried out via radio or telephone and for serious situations, doctors are flown out to patients.


Terminology.
Culturally, many urban Australians have had very generalised terms for the otherwise complex range of environments that exist within the inland and tropical regions of the continent. Regional terminology can be very specific to specific locations in each mainland state.

It is colloquially said that 'the outback' is located "beyond the Black Stump". The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore. It has been suggested that the term comes from the Black Stump Wine Saloon that once stood about 10 kilometres out of Coolah, New South Wales on the Gunnedah Road. It is claimed that the saloon, named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek, was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.

"The Never-Never" is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback. The outback can be also referred to as "back of beyond",  "back o' Bourke" although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away. The well-watered north of the continent is often called the "Top End" and the arid interior "The Centre".

Tourism.

There are many popular tourist attractions in the outback. These include:

Alice Springs;
Birdsville;
Uluru (Ayers Rock);
Coober Pedy;
Devils Marbles;
Katherine River Gorge;
Kakadu National Park;
Kings Canyon (Watarrka);
The Olgas (Kata Tjuta);
MacDonnell Ranges;
Mount Isa;
Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame;
Monkey Mia;
Broome;
Mount Augustus National Park;

Organised travel to the outback is popular, although some Australian and international tourists travel in their own vehicles. Such a trip, particularly once off the few bitumen roads in the outback, requires considerable advance planning and a suitable vehicle (usually a four wheel drive). On remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required, this can include prearranged caches. Some trips cannot be undertaken safely with a single vehicle instead requiring a convoy approach. Deaths from tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips sometimes occur, and rescues for the ill-prepared also take place from time to time.

Historic.
The outback is also criss-crossed by numerous historic tracks, roads and highways, including:

 Birdsville Track;
 Burke Developmental Road;
 Canning Stock Route;
 Colson Track;
 Connie Sue Highway;
 French Line;
 Gary Highway;
 Gibb River Road;
 Gunbarrel Highway;

Ishvara.

In Hinduism, when God is thought of as the supreme all-powerful person (rather than as the infinite principle called Brahman), God is called Bhagavan. Bhagavan is a word used to refer to the personal aspect of God in general; it is not specific to a particular deity. Bhagavan transcends gender, yet can be looked upon as both father and mother, child, or sweetheart. Most Hindus, in their daily devotional practices, worship some form of this personal aspect of God, although they believe in the more abstract concept of Brahman as well.  Sometimes this means worshiping God through an image or a picture. Sometimes it just means thinking of God as a personal being.

Depending on which aspect of  one is talking about, a different name will be used and frequently a different image or picture.  For instance, when God is talked about in the aspect as the creator, God is called Brahma.  When referred to in the capacity as preserver of the world, God is called Vishnu. When referred to in the capacity as destroyer of the world, God is called Shiva. 

Many of these individual aspects of God also have other names and images. For example, Krishna and Rama are considered forms of Vishnu. All the various deities and images one finds in Hinduism are considered manifestations of the same God, called  in the personal aspect and Brahman when referred to as an abstract concept. 

In their personal religious practices, Hindus worship primarily one or another of these deities, known as their "ishta devat ," or chosen idol. The particular form of God worshipped as one's chosen ideal is a matter of individual preference. Regional and family traditions can play a large part in influencing this choice. Hindus may also take guidance about this choice from their scriptures.

Although Hindus may worship deities other than their chosen idol from time to time as well, depending on the occasion and their personal inclinations, it is not expected that they will worship or even know about every form of God. Hindus generally choose one concept of God (e.g., Krishna, Rama, Shiva, or Kali) and cultivate devotion to that chosen form, while at the same time respecting the chosen ideals of other people.

Devas & devis.


The Hindu religion speaks of many individual deities, called Devas. Goddesses are called dev s. The various devas and dev s are personifications of various aspects of one and the same God (Ishvara).  For instance, when a Hindu thinks of Ishvara as the giver of knowledge and learning, that aspect of Ishvara is personified as the deity Saraswati.  In the same manner, the deity Lakshmi personifies Ishvara as the giver of wealth and prosperity. This does not imply that Ishvara is the Lord of all the other deities; Ishvara is just the name used to refer to the personal God in general, when no particular deity is being referred to. 

The devas (also called ) constitute an integral part of the colorful Hindu culture.  These various forms of God are depicted in innumerable paintings, statues, murals, and scriptural stories that can be found in temples, homes, businesses, and other places. In Hinduism the scriptures recommend that for the satisfaction of a particular material desire a person may worship a particular deity.
For example, shopkeepers frequently keep a statue or picture of the devi Lakshmi in their shops.  The elephant-headed deva known as Ganesha is worshipped before commencing any undertaking, as he represents God's aspect as the remover of obstacles. Students and scholars may propitiate Saraswati, the devi of learning, before taking an exam or giving a lecture.

The most ancient Vedic devas included Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Mitra, Savitri, Rudra, Prajapati, Vishnu, Aryaman and the Ashvins; important  were Sarasvati, Ushas and Prithvi. Later scriptures called the Puranas recount traditional stories about each individual deity. 

 and Shiva are not regarded as ordinary devas but as  ("Great Gods" ) because of their central positions in worship and mythology. The Puranas also laud other devas, such as Ganesha and Hanum n, and avatar such as  Rama and Krishna (see below). Goddesses are worshiped when God is thought of as the Universal Mother.  Particular forms of the Universal Mother include Lakshmi, Sarasvati and Parvati, Durga, and  Kali.

There are some Hindus who consider the various deities not as forms of the one Ishwara, but as independently existing entities, and may thus be properly considered polytheistic to some extent.

Avataras (incarnations of God).


Many denominations of Hinduism, such as Vaishnavism and Smartism, teach that from time to time, God comes to Earth as a human being to help humans along in their struggle toward enlightenment and salvation (moksha).  Such an incarnation of God is called an avat ra.  In some respects, the Hindu concept of avatara is similar to the belief found in Christianity that God came to the earth in the form of Jesus.  However, whereas most Christians believe that God has assumed a human body on only one occasion, Hinduism teaches that there have been multiple avatars throughout history--and that there will be more in the future. Thus Krishna, who is not only viewed as an incaranation but also source of all incarnations, says:


Whenever righteousness declines

And unrighteousness increases,

I make myself a body;

In every age I come back

To deliver the holy,

To destroy the sin of the sinner,

To establish righteousness.


The most famous of the divine incarnations are Rama, whose life is depicted in the Ramayana, and Krishna, whose life is depicted in the Mahabharata and the Srimad Bhagavatam. The Bhagavad Gita, which contains the spiritual teachings of Krishna, is one of the most widely-read scriptures in Hinduism.

Trimurti.
In Hinduism, the Trimurti (also called the Hindu trinity) are three aspects of God in His forms as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. 

Brahma - the creator;
Vishnu - the preserver;
Shiva - the destroyer;

Popular gods.
Some other popular Hindu aspects of God include Devi, Krishna, Ganesh, Hanuman, Murugan, Ramachandra and Lakshmi. Smarta Hindus believe that God, in whatever form they prefer, ("Ishta Devata,", i.e., the preferred form of God) can grant worshippers grace to bring them closer to Moksha, end of the cycle of rebirth. The great Hindu saint Ramakrishna studied and embraced other religions, such as Christianity and Islam, and came to the same conclusion proclaimed by the Vedas, "Truth is One; the wise call it by various names.
(Ekam Sat Viprah Bahuda Vadanti)

Denominations of Hinduism.
Contemporary Hinduism traditionally has four major divisions, Saivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and  Smarthism.

According to Adherents.com there are
580,000,000 Vaishnavas, 220,000,000 Shaivites and 22,000,000 neo-Hindus and reform Hindus.

However the Shakti sect connects God as Lord Shiva also, as the Aparabrahm while Shakti is the Parabrahm. Further the Saura sect connects itself with Lord Vishnu, one of the 12 Adityas (solar deities.) Ganesha worshippers would connect themselves with Lord Shiva as Lord Shiva is the Father of Lord Ganesha and hence, Lord Ganesha is a Shaiv deity.

Hinduism is a very rich and complex religion. Each of its four denominations shares rituals, beliefs, traditions and personal Gods with one another, but each sect have a same and different philosophy on how to achieve life's ultimate goal (moksa, liberation). For example a person can be a Shiv devotee and a Vishnu devotee but they can practice the Advaita Vedanta philosophy (Darshana) which believes there is no difference between the Brahman and the Soul. Conversely a Hindu may follow the Dvaita philosophy which stresses that Brahman and the Soul are not the same. But each denomination fundamentally  believes in different methods of self-realisation and in different aspects of the One Supreme God. However, each denomination respects and accepts all others, and conflict of any kind is rare.

Vaishnavism, Saivism and Shaktism, respectively believe in a monotheistic ideal of Vishnu (often as Krishna), Shiva, or Devi; this view does not exclude other personal Gods, as they are understood to be aspects of the chosen ideal (e.g., to many devotees of Krishna, Shiva is seen as having sprung from Krishna's creative force). Often, the monad Brahman is seen as the one source, with all other gods emanating therefrom. Thus, with all Hindus, there is a strong belief in all paths being true religions that lead to one God or source, whatever one chooses to call the ultimate truth.

Even Vaisnavites, like other Hindus, have tolerance for other beliefs because Lord Krishna, avatar of Vishnu, said so in the Gita. Krishna said: 

"I am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity. Endowed with such a faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone." (Gita: 7:21-22). ;

Another quote in the Gita states: 

"Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunt , but they do so in a wrong way." (Gita: 9:23). ;

Even a Vedic verse illustrates this theme of tolerance. The Vedas are revered in Hinduism, regardless of denomination. For example, a well-known Rig Vedic hymn stemming from Hinduism states that "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously." This is in contrast with some other religious traditions, where one must believe in only one form of God and to totally reject or disdain other beliefs.

Polytheistic gods.
Although the pantheistic system allowed only a subordinate rank to the old polytheistic gods, and the actual religious belief of the people was probably but little affected by their existence, they continued to occupy an important place in the affections of the poet, and were still represented as exercising considerable influence on the destinies of man. The most prominent of them were regarded as the appointed Loka palas, or guardians of the world; and as such they were made to preside over the four cardinal and (according to some authorities) the intermediate points of the compass. 

Thus Indra, the chief of the devas, was regarded as the regent of the east; Agni, the fire, was in the same way associated with the southeast; Yama, lord of death and justice with the south; Surya, the sun, with the southwest; Varuna, originally the representative of the all-embracing heaven (atmosphere), now the god of the ocean, with the west; Vayu (or Pavana), the wind, with the northwest; Kubera, the god of wealth, with the north; and Soma with the northeast. (Note: In some traditions, na, an aspect of Siva is regarded as the regent of the northeast and Nirrti the regent of the southwest.)

In the institutes of Manu the Loka palas are represented as standing in close relation to the ruling king, who is saki to be composed of particles of these his tutelary deities. The retinue of Indra consists chiefly of the Devas(angels), Gandharvas, a class of genii, considered in the epics as the celestial musicians; and Apsaras, lovely nymphs, who are frequently employed by the gods to make the pious devotee desist from carrying his austere practices to an extent that might render him dangerous to their power. Narada, an ancient sage (probably a personification of the cloud, the water-giver), is considered as the messenger between the gods and men, and as having sprung from the forehead of Brahma. The interesting office of the god of love is held by Kamadeva, also called Ananga, the bodyless, because, as the myth relates, having once tried by the power of his mischievous arrow to make Siva fall in love with Parvati, whilst he was engaged in devotional practices, the urchin was reduced to ashes by a glance of the angry god. Two other mythological figures of some importance are considered as sons of Siva and Parvati, viz. Karttikeya or Skanda, the leader of the heavenly armies, who was supposed to have been fostered by the six Knittikas or Pleiades; and Ganesha ( lord of troops ), the elephant-headed god of wisdom, and at the same time the leader of the dii minorum gentium.

Smartism.

Smartism, a denomination of Hinduism is a monist as well as a monotheist religion that understands different deities as representing various aspects and principles of one supreme entity, Brahman or parabrahman. Teachers such as Swami Vivekananda, who brought Hinduism to the West, held beliefs like those found in Smartism, although he usually referred to his religion as Vedanta.  Other denominations of Hinduism do not strictly hold this belief.
A Smartist would have no problem worshiping Shiva or Vishnu together as he views the different aspects of God as leading to the same One God. It is the Smarta view that dominates the view of Hinduism in the West. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the one true God, worthy of worship and other forms as subordinate. See for example, an illustration of the Vaishnavite view of Vishnu as the one true God, at this link. 
Accordingly, many Vaishnavites, for example, believe that only Vishnu can grant the ultimate aim for mankind, moksha. See for example, this link. Similarly, many Shaivites also hold similar beliefs, as illustrated at at this link and at this link.

Devas in the Vedas.

The pantheon in the rauta tradition consists of various gods and goddesses. However these entities may not hold the traditional meaning of gods and goddesses in English. Instead the devas (which is the Sanskrit word used to represent these entities) represent certain forces. For instance, the deva Agni has one aspect as the flame. but this flame symbolises the psychological power associated with Agni namely the power of will. Agni can be called God-will. Similarly Indra is the God-mind; Sarasvati is the Power of Inspiration, not merely of learning.

The main devas are (vide 6th anuvaka of Chamakam):
Agni;
Indra;
Soma;
Savitr;
Vayu;
Varuna;
Marutas;
Aditya;
Rudra;
Vishnu;
Brahma;

Pusha;
Brihaspati;
Ashwinis;
Vishvedavas;
Prithvi;

The Lancia Dedra is a large family car produdced by the Italian automaker Lancia from 1990 to 1998. It was based on the Fiat Tipo-floorpan and it functioned as the saloon version of the second generation Lancia Delta. It was launched as successor to the Prisma, but was not a strong success outside Italy. A major facelift in 1993 did little to boost the car's sales success and the whole Lancia range including the Dedra was withdrawn from right-hand drive markets a year later. The car, after 1993 also sold as a station wagon, remained popular on the Italian market until it was replaced by the all-new Lybra.

The Dedra was developed alongside the Fiat Tempra on the Tipo floorpan as a large family car, but while the Fiat models were small family cars, the Lancia models were supposed to be on the next segment. The design, by the I.DE.A Institute, produced an excellent drag coefficient of only 0.29. The core of the product was prestige, exclusivity, personality and comfort, achieved through a high level of equipment and use of materials (eg Alcantara) as well as details such as special paints, alloy wheels and an attention to soundproofing, ventilation and other issues. Inside the ability to obtain the perfect driving position was helped by the adjustable seats, steering wheel and electrically adjustable mirrors. Safety, both passive with a structure designed to minimise injury in an accident, and active, such as ABS, was also near the top of the Dedra's agenda.

<doc id="2943397" title="Manx literature" nonfiltered="1509" processed="1488" dbindex="1481525">
Manx literature is literature in the Manx language.

The earliest datable text in Manx (preserved in 18th century manuscripts), a poetic history of the Isle of Man from the introduction of Christianity, dates to the 16th century at the latest.

Christianity has been an overwhelming influence on Manx literature. Religious literature was common, but surviving secular writing much rarer. The Book of Common Prayer and Bible were translated into Manx in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first Manx Bible was printed between 1771 and 1775 and is the source and standard for modern Manx orthography. It was a collective translation undertaken by most the Manx clergy under the editorship of Philip Moore. Further editions followed in 1777 and 1819. A tradition of carvals, religious songs or carols, developed, probably with its roots in the pre-Reformation period. Until the 18th century, the authors of carvals were generally clergy, but in the 19th century new words would be put to popular tunes for use in churches and chapels.

The first printed work in Manx, Coyrle Sodjeh, dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book catechism in English by Bishop Thomas Wilson.

Pargys Caillit was an abridged Manx version of Paradise Lost by John Milton published in 1796 by Thomas Christian, vicar of Marown 1780-1799.

Edward Faragher, (Neddy Beg Hom Ruy, 1831-1908) of Cregneash has been considered the last important native writer of Manx. From the age of 26, he wrote poetry, often on religious subjects, some of which were printed in the Mona's Herald and the Cork Eagle. Some of his stories are reminiscences of his life as a fisherman, and in 1901 Skeealyn Aesop, translations of selected Aesop's Fables, was published.

With the revival of Manx, new literature has appeared, including Contoyryssyn Ealish ayns Cheer ny Yindyssyn a Manx translation of Alice in Wonderland by Brian Stowell, published in 1990.

<doc id="8249333" title="Crouching Venus" nonfiltered="1513" processed="1492" dbindex="1481529">


This article discusses the type itself: see links within it for specific instances of the type.;

The Crouching Venus is a Hellenistic model of Venus surprised at her bath. Venus crouches with her right knee close to the ground, turns her head to the right and, in most versions, reaches her right arm over to her left shoulder to cover her breasts. To judge by the number of copies that have been excavated on Roman sites in Italy and France, this variant on Venus seems to have been popular.

A number of examples of the Crouching Venus in prominent collections have influenced modern sculptors since Giambologna and have been drawn by artists since Martin Heemskerck, who made a drawing of the Farnese Crouching Venus that is now in Naples.

Attribution.
The model is often related to a corrupt passage in Pliny the Elder's Natural History (xxxvi.35), enumerating sculptures in the Temple of Jupiter Stator in the Portico of Ottava, near the Roman Forum; the text has been emended to a mention of Venerem lavantem sese Daedalsas, stantem Polycharmus ("Venus washing herself, of Daedalsas, another, standing, of Polycharmus"), recording a sculpture of a Venus who was not standing, by the otherwise unknown Doidalses or Daedalsas.

Ancient examples.
Such terse archival references and so many existing ancient versions make archival identification of the Roman copies insecure, though some include a water jar and/or an additional figure of Eros which make identification easier. They are often paired with the other famous crouching sculpture of Antiquity, the Arrotino.

The Crouching Venus of the Medici collection, noted at Villa Medici, Rome, is now at the Uffizi in Florence. It was engraved (with its restored sea-shell - see here) by Paolo Alessandro Maffei, Raccolta di statue antiche e moderni..., 1704 (plate XXVIII);

The Crouching Venus of the Farnese collection of marbles, restored with a small Eros who engages the goddess's attention, is now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples. It was drawn by Martin Heemskerck.;


The Lely Venus (main image, above) is an Antonine marble that was in the Gonzaga collection, Mantua, where it was inventoried in 1631 as "the finest statue of all" and valued at 6000 ecus (Haskell and Penny 1981:321). It was soon purchased for Charles I of England, whose art collections were dispersed during the Commonwealth, and afterwards came into the possession of the painter and connoisseur Sir Peter Lely. It has passed once again into the Royal Collection and is on loan to the British Museum .

The Crouching Venus excavated at Salona (modern Solin near Split, Croatia) in the second half of the eighteenth century was purchased for the Vatican Museums, where it was etched by Francesco, the son of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, then confiscated by the French under Napoleon but returned to the Vatican in 1816, where it remains.

The Vénus Accroupie, is a second-century crouching Venus from the collection of Louis XIV, now in the Musée du Louvre.


The Crouching Venus of Vienne, considered one of the finest Roman marbles of this type (Haskell and Penny 1981:323), was excavated near Vienne in 1828 and came to the Louvre, where Cézanne drew it and adapted it for one of the figures in his Grande Baigneuses (Philadelphia).

A Crouching Venus that was excavated at that quarry of antiquities, Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, in the 1920s, is accounted among the finest of the Roman versions (Haskell and Penny 1981:323). It is conserved in essentially unrestored condition in the Museo Nazionale delle Terme, Rome.

A small marble Crouching Aphrodite of the first century BCE, discovered in Rhodes and conserved in the Rhodes Archaeological Museum, is a variant of the pose in which Venus lifts her hair in her fingers to dry it.  The type is sometimes distinguished as the Crouching Aphrodite of Rhodes.

Appreciation in the Renaissance.

The early interpretation of the figure, as Venus at her birth, about to be carried ashore   a type of Venus Anadyomene   encouraged the restoration of a shell upon which she crouches, in which form the Medici sculpture was engraved by Paolo Alessandro Maffei, Raccolta di statue antiche e moderni..., 1704 (plate XXVIII)

Versions since the Renaissance.
Several versions of the Crouching Venus issued from the atelier of Giambologna and his heir Antonio Susini; among examples of Susini's bronze reduction, one from the collection of Louis XIV is conserved in the Holburne Museum of Art, Bath , while another, in the collection of Prince Carl Eusebius von Liechtenstein by 1658, remains in the Liechtenstein collection, Vienna.

A famous variant in marble was delivered by Antoine Coysevox in 1686 for the Château de Marly; Coysevox, who set his Venus on a tortoise rather than a shell, was so exultant in his success that he inscribed the name of Phidias in Greek as well as his own. The sculpture pleased the king to the extent that a bronze version was cast. Today the Marly marble is at the Musée du Louvre and the Marly bronze is at the Château de Versailles.

At Caserta Palace, the would-be Versailles outside Naples, a marble copy by Tomasso Solari was provided for the vast gardens in 1762 (Haskell and Penny 1981:323).

Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's Crouching Flora (ca 1873), in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, reinterprets the familiar pose.

The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions (ISBN 0-681-03189-1) is a book by Mark Lewisohn and published by Hamlyn (a division of the Octopus Publishing Group) and executively produced by Norman Bates for the record company EMI.

The book looks at each of the recording sessions held by The Beatles from September 4, 1962, shortly after The Beatles had returned to England from Germany, to their last one, on April 2, 1970, when Let it Be was re-mixed. It goes on to tell about what happened on May 8 of that same year, when the Let it Be album was released. It also talks about how The Beatles would seldom record together during their last months as a group.

The book  contains an interview with Paul McCartney and remarks by all members of The Beatles, except the ones that were dismissed before their first recording. As a matter of a fact, it merely mentions Pete Best a couple of times. 

Excerpts of things that George Martin, Phil Spector and musicians that helped The Beatles out on some songs, said during their recording sessions, are also included.

The 204 page book was first produced in 1988 by EMI in Europe, printed and bound in China and produced, also in 1988, by Toppan for the Asian market and by Harmony for the United States.  In 2004, it was re-produced by EMI to be sold at other markets worldwide, and has become a great success.

Who Made Yellow Roses Yellow? is a short story by the novelist John Updike, published in his collection The Same Door in 1959. The title refers to controversies relating to organic and non-organic farming. 

Plot synopsis.

As the story begins, Fred Platt, the main character, is about to place a telephone call to a college friend he hasn't seen in years. Platt, as the opening sentence indicates, comes from 'old money' -- he is three generations removed from its acquisition. He wants to acquire a job without the contaminating hand of his father's connections.

Accordingly, he calls his old friend Clayton Thomas. Clayton is now an executive in the advertising wing of a large chemical company, hence the story's title. The drama in the story consists of Fred's horror at Clayton's gauche, new-money ways, a horror that he with some effort suppresses in the interest of asking Clayton for work.

Some nice touches arise from Fred's brief conversations with each of the two secretaries through whom his phone call must pass before he can talk to Clayton. For example, the second secretary asks, "About what was it you wished to speak to him?" and one senses an earnest and newly-educated woman's effort to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition. Fred, when he does finally reach Clayton, asks (in counterpoint), "Who are all these girls you live in the midst of?"

It is a holiday destination close to Skegness, Spilsby, the Lincolnshire Wolds and the Coast.

The town is famous for the Batemans Brewery.

The village was the end on the Great Northern Railway until the construction of the town of Skegness some 6-7 miles east.  It is notable for it's market place clocktower and Barkham Street, a replica of an east London street uncomfortably situated in a village setting.

Just off the A52 both north and south of the village of Wainfleet All Saints can be seen two mounds both believed to be viking burial mounds. A number of coins from the period have been found in the vicinity.

Abigail Anne Folger (August 11, 1943   August 9, 1969) was an American coffee heiress, debutante, socialite, volunteer social worker, civil rights devotee and member of the prominent United States Folger family. She was the great-great-granddaughter of J. A. Folger, the founder of Folgers Coffee.



Early life.
Folger was born in San Francisco, California. Her parents were Peter Folger, Chairman and President of the Folger Coffee Company, and Inez Mejia, the daughter of a prestigious California land grant family. Her Catholic parents divorced in 1952 when Abigail was still young, after her mother ended the marriage on the grounds of extreme cruelty. In 1960, her father married again, this time to his 24-year-old private secretary, Beverly Mater. 

Growing up in San Francisco, Abigail was raised in the closed tradition of San Francisco society. As a young girl she was interested in art, books, and poetry. She spent much of her time painting and writing poetry when she had the time. Besides her interests in painting and poetry, Abigail was very talented in playing the piano. Close friends and family called her 'Gibby'.

Abigail Folger attended the Santa Catalina School for Girls in Monterey, California, near Carmel. There, she was well known and well liked as a model student who graduated with honors in June of 1961. She then matriculated at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the fall of 1961. During her stay at Radcliffe she became an active member of the college's Gilbert and Sullivan Players, a musical theatre group. Abigail starred in two of its productions, starting with The Sorcerer in April 1963 where she played the part of one of the town's villagers. In December 1963 she starred in The Gondoliers as the pretty Contadine. Abigail graduated with honors from Radcliffe College in 1964. 

While a freshman in college, she became a debutante on December 21, 1961 at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, where she made her official debut into San Francisco's high society. Her debutante ball was one of the highlights of the social season, with Folger wearing a bright yellow Christian Dior gown that she had purchased in Paris the previous summer. 

After graduating from Radcliffe, she enrolled in the fall of 1964 at Harvard University, also in Cambridge, where she did graduate work and received a degree in Art History. After graduating in the spring of 1967, she took a job at the University of California Art Museum in Berkeley, California as a publicity director. While employed there, Abigail's main job was to organize the fine art museum council.

New York City.
In September 1967, Folger decided to move away from California in order to find herself and to probe the other side of life. She didn't stay in Berkeley for long; she soon made the move to New York City, where she got a job working for a magazine publisher. She eventually left for a job at the Gotham Book Mart on 47th Street. While living in New York, she chose to live well beneath her means. As the daughter of the name which meant coffee millions, Folger's annual income from her inheritances, after taxes, was $130,000 a year.

It was at a bookstore party in December 1967 where she met Polish author Jerzy Kosinski, who was married to American steel heiress Mary Hayward Weir. Hayward Weir ran in the same wealthy circle as Folger, and it was she who introduced Kosinski to Abigail. In early January 1968, Kosinski introduced Abigail to his friend, aspiring writer Wojciech Frykowski, at a party and the two hit it off. Frykowski had been living in the United States for one month at the time.

Folger and Frykowski.
Wojciech was not then fluent in English, but, like Abigail, he was fluent in French. Abigail gave him a tour of New York, began to teach him English, and a romance soon blossomed. He moved into her New York City apartment and she soon found herself supporting him financially.  

In August 1968, both Folger and Frykowski decided to move to Los Angeles, California. Wojciech wanted to pursue his writing career while Abigail wanted to get involved with a new welfare project that was currently under way. Abigail rented a car, and she and Wojciech drove across the country.

In Los Angeles, Abigail found a two-storey hilltop home to rent at 2774 Woodstock Road for her and Wojciech in Laurel Canyon, and bought herself a 1968 yellow Firebird. Their neighbor across the road was singer Cass Elliot of the rock group The Mamas & the Papas, whom the couple quickly befriended. Through Wojciech, Abigail met the Polanskis, Roman and Sharon. Through the Polanskis, Abigail and Wojciech were introduced to Jay Sebring. The five quickly began to hang out together and were known to be a part of 'the beautiful people crowd' in Hollywood. In a 2006 interview for the History Channel show Our Generation: Death of the Counterculture, Michelle Phillips, also of The Mamas & the Papas, said that she was very good friends with all of the Tate murder victims (presumably excluding Steven Parent) and that it was still hard to talk about the murders.

Social work.
Like her mother, Inez, who was active doing charity work with the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco, Abigail continued to be involved with volunteer work. She registered as a volunteer social worker for the Los Angeles County Welfare Department in September 1968. Earlier, in the spring and summer of 1968, Abigail attended fundraisers set up by her mother to aid the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. It was around the same time many of the Manson family women were being treated there. Back in Los Angeles, Abigail spent long days in the ghettos doing her job as a volunteer social worker with children, waking up at dawn each day.  

In December 1968 Folger invested $3,500 in Sebring International, Jay Sebring's hair care products for men.

On March 15, 1969, Abigail, Sebring, and Wojciech attended the catered housewarming party of the Polanskis at 10050 Cielo Drive. Over one hundred guests, such as Jane Fonda, Roger Vadim, Peter Fonda, Tony Curtis, Warren Beatty, Nancy Sinatra, Michael Sarne, Michelle Phillips, John Phillips, and Cass Elliot, attended. The next day, Polanski left for London to begin work on a new film. 

Meanwhile, Folger's work as a social worker soon began to take a toll on her and she became depressed. Adding to her depression was the knowledge that the children that she worked with in the poor areas of Los Angeles, such as Watts and Pacoima, were deprived. She would later admit that the suffering affected her deeply. Around this time, Abigail bought herself a Dalmatian puppy, which she named Tom.

On March 23, 1969, an odd incident occurred at 10050 Cielo Drive. That afternoon, Abigail and Wojciech went over to the Polanskis home for a going away dinner party for Tate, who was leaving for Rome the next day. Sebring was there, as well as Tate's friend, Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian photographer. Rudi Altobelli, the owner of the Cielo home, had attended the party briefly, but soon returned to his guest house to pack for his upcoming trip to Europe. The incident involved a strange looking man who had appeared on the property as the occupants of the house sat in the dining room, which faced the front of the residence. Hatami felt uneasy about this stranger roaming the Polanski estate, looking at people he did not know, so he left the house to confront the man. From the front porch, the party inside could be seen through the large dining room windows. Hatami asked the stranger if he could help him. The stranger said he was looking for someone by the name of Terry Melcher, a name Hatami did not recognize. Hatami made it clear to the stranger that this was the Polanski residence, and suggested that perhaps the person he was looking for lived in the guest house. Later, this stranger was identified as Charles Manson.

Politics.

From April to May 1968, Abigail became a political volunteer for the ill-fated presidential campaign of New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Folger donated both time and money to the Kennedy campaign. Abigail believed strongly and shared in Kennedy's political views, so she naturally supported him. Sadly, the dream soon came to an end when Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles in early June.

The next year during the month of April and continuing through most of May, Abigail was a political volunteer for the campaign of Tom Bradley, a black councilman running for mayor of Los Angeles. She contributed both her time and a large amount of her own money to the Bradley campaign. The defeat of Bradley by Sam Yorty in late May was due to a racial smear campaign, and it left Abigail feeling both bitter and disillusioned. This led her to become very involved with the civil rights movement that summer. 

10050 Cielo Drive.
On April 1, 1969, while Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski were away in Europe filming movies, Abigail and Wojciech moved into the Polanskis' Cielo Drive home in Benedict Canyon, at Polanski's request. At the same time, their Woodstock Road home was being occupied by Wojciech's friend, Polish artist Witold-K, who had arrived in the United States the previous December. A day earlier, Abigail had quit her job as a social worker. It was at this time that Abigail's relationship with Wojciech began to crumble. Constantly fighting, the pair began to sink lower into their world of experimental drug use.

In May 1969, Abigail and her mother attended the San Francisco opening of Jay Sebring's newest shop at 629 Commercial Street. Abigail enjoyed the champagne reception and found herself mingling with such guests as Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Doris Tate, and her husband Paul Tate (Sharon's parents).

In June 1969, Abigail and her mother took a vacation together in New York.

On July 8, 1969, Folger and Frykowski learned that Sharon Tate would be returning to the U.S. later that month. The couple then began to move most of their clothing from Cielo Drive back to their own home on Woodstock Road. They informed Wojciech's friend, Witold-K, that they would be soon returning to live in their home after Tate's arrival. 

On July 20, 1969, Tate returned to California from London and asked Abigail and Wojciech to remain at 10050 Cielo Drive with her until her husband Roman Polanski arrived on August 12. Abigail, Wojciech, Sharon and Jay, along with Tate's parents and two younger sisters, all watched the moon landing on television.

On Wednesday August 6, 1969 film director Michael Sarne invited Folger, Frykowski and Tate over for a dinner party at his rented Malibu beach house. After dessert had been served, Tate began to feel unwell, so it was decided that Folger and Frykowski would drive her home.

Death.
On Friday morning, August 8, 1969, Abigail and Wojciech ran some errands together. Folger purchased a yellow, lightweight bicycle around 2 p.m. from a shop on Santa Monica Boulevard and arranged for it to be delivered to Cielo Drive later that afternoon. She and Wojciech then drove back to the Polanskis home and had a late lunch with Tate and her friends, Joanna Pettet and Barbara Lewis, on the front lawn patio. The late lunch was served to the party of five by Winifred Chapman, the Polanskis housekeeper. Shortly after, at around 3:45 p.m., Abigail left Cielo Drive in her 1968 yellow Pontiac Firebird in order to keep an appointment she had later that afternoon. Frykowski left minutes later, in Tate's rented 1969 red Camaro, to unload a box at the couple's Woodstock Road home.

That evening, just after 9 p.m., Abigail, Wojciech, Jay Sebring, and Sharon Tate went out to a Mexican restaurant called El Coyote. Returning home, Wojciech fell asleep on the couch while Abigail was in her room reading. Abigail's mother called her at 10 p.m. that night to verify their weekend plans. Abigail was scheduled to fly to San Francisco at 10 a.m. Saturday morning on United Airlines in order to celebrate her birthday on the 11th. Her mother Inez would join her later, as she was coming in from Connecticut after spending time with some of her friends.

Followers of Charles Manson broke into the house in the early morning hours of Saturday, August 9, 1969. When one of them (Susan Atkins) passed her bedroom door, Abigail, believing the woman was a friend of the Polanskis, waved and smiled to the intruder. When the occupants of the house were assembled in the living room, their captors asked if any of them had any money. Abigail responded that she did and was led to her bedroom to empty her purse. On returning to the living room, the four friends were tied together. After being stabbed and struggling with the murderers, she managed to escape the house only to be overcome on the lawn outside by Patricia Krenwinkel. She was stabbed twenty-eight times and died from a stab wound to the aorta. Allegedly,  Folger's dying words were,   "You can stop now;  I'm already dead."  Although coroners found a large amount of the drug MDA in her system, they reached the conclusion that she was fully aware of what was happening when the attack occurred.

Abigail Folger's body was returned to San Francisco and taken to Crippen and Flynn Mortuary in Redwood City. Her funeral was held on the morning of Wednesday, August 13, 1969, at Our Lady of the Wayside Church in Portola Valley, a church that had been built by her grandparents, the Mejias, in 1912. Following a Catholic requiem mass, Abigail Folger was entombed inside the Main Mausoleum at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

After her death, investigators reported that Folger's estate was worth $530,000. She left no will.

Giorgio Armani (born 11 July, 1934) is an Italian fashion designer, particularly noted for his menswear.
 
Biography.
Armani was born in Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. He originally trained in science, then gave it up to pursue photography, before being called up for national service in 1957. He then worked in a department store, La Rinascente, as a window dresser. From 1961 to 1970, Armani worked as a designer in well-known fashion house Nino Cerruti, after which he left to pursue freelance work. In 1974, with his partner Sergio Galeotti, he established Giorgio Armani S.p.A. with a menswear label, introducing a womenswear line in 1975. His sister Rosanna Armani joined him in the company; Galeotti died in 1985. 
Giorgio Armani is also known as being a fan of Inter Milan. In fact, according to reports, in 2006 there was a posibility that he would be new Inter's president. He is known today for his clean, tailored lines. He achieved his international breakthrough by tailoring for numerous Hollywood names and especially for Richard Gere in the title role of American Gigolo in 1980. Armani was also noted for building a mansion on the Caribbean island of Antigua, and being among the first designers to ban models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18, after model Ana Carolina Reston starved herself to death due to anorexia nervosa.

In the news.
In 2001, Forbes named Giorgio Armani the most successful Italian designer, estimating his net worth at $1.7 billion. The following year he was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

In 2005, Armani was named the "Best Dressed Environmentalist" by the Sustainable Style Foundation. In 2006, he designed the ceremonial Italian flag-bearers' outfits at the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Turin, Italy.

Jacob Freudenthal (born June 20, 1839, at Bodenfelde, province of Hanover, Prussia -1907) was a German philosopher.

Freudenthal received his education at the universities of Breslau and Göttingen, and at the rabbinical seminary of Breslau. After graduating from the University of Göttingen (1863) he became teacher of the Samson school in Wolfenbüttel (1863-64), whence be removed to Breslau as teacher in the rabbinical seminary there, a position which he resigned in 1888. In 1875 he became lecturer in philosophy at the University of Breslau; in 1878 he was elected assistant professor, in 1888 professor, of philosophy. He was a member of the senate of the university in 1894-96, and dean of the philosophical faculty in 1898-99. The Prussian Academy of Science sent him to England in 1888 to study English philosophy, and in 1898 to the Netherlands to prosecute researches on the life of Spinoza.

The results of these voyages were his "Beiträge zur Englischen Philosophie", in the "Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie" (iv. 450 et seq., v. 1 et seq.), and "Die Lebensgeschichte Spinoza's", Leipzig, 1899.

<doc id="1559605" title="Thiazole" nonfiltered="1525" processed="1504" dbindex="1481542">


Thiazole, or 1,3-thiazole, is an organic chemical compound with the empirical formula C3H3NS. Its structure is a 5-membered ring, in which two of the vertices of the ring are nitrogen and sulfur, and the other three are carbons .

It is a clear to pale yellow flammable liquid with boiling point 116-118 °C and pyridine-like odor. 

Thiazole is used for manufacturing biocides, fungicides, pharmaceuticals, and dyes. 

Thiazoles and thiazolium salts.
Thiazoles are a class of organic compounds related to azoles with a common thiazole functional group. 

Thiszole is aromatic

The thiazole moiety is a crucial part of vitamin B1 (thiamine) and epothilone. Other important thiazoles are Benzothiazoles for example the firefly chemical luciferin.

When the amino atom is alkylated the resulting thiazolium salt is a salt. Thiazolium salts are catalysts in the Stetter reaction and the Benzoin condensation. Thiazole dyes are used for dying cotton.

Oxazoles are related compound with sulfur replaced by oxygen. Thiazoles are well represented in biomolecules, oxazoles are not.



Organic synthesis.
Various laboratory methods exist for the organic synthesis of thiazoles.
 The Hantzsch thiazole synthesis (1889) is a reaction between haloketones and thioamides. For example, 2,4-dimethylthiazole is synthesized from acetamide, phosphorus pentasulfide and chloroacetone . Another example  is given below:



 In an adaptation of the Robinson-Gabriel synthesis a 2-acylamino-ketones reacts with phosphorus pentasulfide;
 In the Cook-Heilbron synthesis an  -aminonitrile reacts with carbon disulfide.
 Certain thiazoles can be accessed though application of the Herz reaction.

Organic reactions.
Thiazoles are characterized by larger pi-electron delocalization than the corresponding oxazoles and have therefore greater aromaticity. This is evidenced by the position of the ring protons in proton NMR (between 7.27 and 8.77 ppm) clearly indicating a strong diamagnetic ring current. 

The calculated pi-electron density marks C5 as the primary electrophilic site and C2 as the nucleophilic site. 



The reactivity of a thiazole can be summarized as follows:
 Deprotonation at C2, the negative charge on this position is stabilized as an ylide. Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react at this site replacing the proton. ;



 2-(trimethylsiliyl)thiazole  (with a trimethylsilyl group in the 2-position) is a stable substitute and reacts with a range of electrophiles such as aldehydes, acyl halides and ketenes.

 Alkylation at nitrogen forms a thiazolium salt.
 Electrophilic aromatic substitution at C5 requires activating groups such as a methyl group in this bromination:



 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution often requires an electrofuge at C2 such as chlorine with ;



 Organic oxidation at nitrogen gives the thiazole N-oxide. Many oxidizing agents exist such as mCPBA, a novel one is hypofluorous acid prepared from fluoride and water in acetonitrile. Some of the oxidation takes place at sulfur leading to a sulfoxide :


 Thiazoles are formyl synthons. Conversion of R-thia to the R-CHO aldehyde takes place with  respectively methyl iodide (N-methylation), organic reduction with sodium borohydride and hydrolysis with mercury chloride in water.

 Thiazoles can react in cycloadditions but in general at high temperatures due to favorable aromatic stabilization of the reactant. Diels-Alder reactions with alkynes are followed by extrusion of sulfur and the endproduct is a pyridine. In one study  a very mild reaction of a 2-(dimethylamino)thiazole with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) to a pyridine was found to proceed through a zwitterionic intermediate in a formal cycloaddition to a cyclobutene, then to a 1,3-thiazepine in an 4-electron electrocyclic ring openening and then to a 7-thia-2-azanorcaradiene in an 6-electron electrocyclic ring closing before extruding the sulfur atom.

<doc id="3666977" title="Cirque d'hiver" nonfiltered="1529" processed="1508" dbindex="1481546">

Since 1852 the Cirque d'hiver (the "Winter Circus"), at the juncture of the rue des Filles Calvaires and rue Amelot, Paris 11ème, has been a prominent venue for circuses, exhibitions of dressage, musical concerts and other events, today also including fashion shows. The orchestral concerts of Jules Etienne Pasdeloup were held at the Cirque d'hiver, as well as exhibitions of Turkish wrestling. 

The circus is an oval polygon of 20 sides, with Corinthian columns at the angles, giving the impression of an oval building enclosing the oval ring, surrounded by steeply banked seating for spectators, very much like a miniature indoor Colosseum. A low angled roof is self-supporting like a low dome, so that there is no central pole, as under a tent, to obstruct views or interfere with the action.

The building was designed by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff and opened as the Cirque Napoléon, a compliment to the new Emperor of the French Napoleon III. The sculptor James Pradier was called upon to provide exterior bas-reliefs of Amazons, and Francisque Duret and Astyanax-Scévola Bosio sculpted the panels of mounted warriors.  

The guiding entrepreneur was Louis Dejean, the proprietor of the Cirque d'été (the "Summer Circus") erected annually in the bosquets that flanked the Champs-Élysées. Dejean wagered that evening circus performances under the limelight, with the spectators well removed from the dust and smells of the tanbark floor, would provide a dress occasion for le tout-Paris and he was well rewarded for his acumen.

After the Second Empire, the Cirque d'hiver was administered by Victor Franconi. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec repeatedly found inspiration in rehearsals and performances at the Cirque d'hiver; Georges Seurat painted an afternoon performance, with a distinctly middle-class audience, in one of the greatest unfinished canvasses in the history of Western painting (1890 91, Musée d'Orsay). Franconi's son Charles assumed direction, 1897   1907. Since 1934 it has been the Cirque d'hiver-Bouglione, operated by the Bouglione brothers and their heirs.

The original configuration accommodated 4,000, which has been reduced today because of fire codes to 2,090.

At the Cirque d'Hiver in August 1955, Richard Avedon took his famous photograph of the fashion model "Dovima with the Elephants"  to show a floor-length evening dress by Dior, one of the most iconic fashion photographs of the century.

The Albergo Reale dei Poveri  is a former public hospital/almshouse in Naples, southern Italy. It was designed by the architect Ferdinando Fuga, and construction was started in 1751. It is five stories tall and about 300 meters long. It was popularly known as "Palazzo Fuga". King Charles III of the House of Bourbon meant the facility to house the destitute and ill, as well as to provide a self-sufficient community where the poor would live and work. The building was originally designed with five courtyards and a church in the centre, but only the three innermost courtyards were built, and plans to complete the building according to the original design were finally abandoned in 1819. The building is the center of Naples, which is included in UNESCO World Heritage List.

It is no longer a hospital, and has suffered much from neglect and earthquakes. The center behind the entrance is used for exhibitions, conferences, and concerts. Recently (2006) the façade has undergone restoration as part of an as yet ill-defined plan to incorporate the facility into the working infrastructure of public buildings in Naples.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer is the debut album of British progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, released in 1970 in the United Kingdom and January of 1971 in the United States.

As a first album from the newly-formed supergroup the influences they brought with them are clear in the mix of instrumental and vocal pieces. The front cover of the album depicts a fluttering white bird with a human ear in the bottom left corner.

The album is not a unified band effort as a whole; only the first track features credits for all three band members. The remainder are essentially solo pieces. "Take a Pebble" and "Lucky Man" are ballads by Greg Lake, precedents to those he would produce on subsequent albums (notably, "C'est La Vie" from Works Volume I and "Still...You Turn Me On" from Brain Salad Surgery). Palmer's solo spot, "Tank", is intended to showcase his virtuoso drumming style, although it does feature accompaniment by Emerson on synthesisers.

Going beyond the incorporation of classical music influences, including using complex time signatures and harmonies and symphonic-type structures which helped to give them their unique sound, the band used lengthy note-for-note extr
