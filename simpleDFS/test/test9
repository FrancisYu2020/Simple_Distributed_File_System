Mary Genevieve Gaudron (born 5 January 1943), Australian lawyer and judge, was the first female Justice of the High Court of Australia.

Youth.

Gaudron was born in Moree, in northern rural New South Wales, in 1943, the daughter of working class parents Edward and Grace. Gaudron would later speak about the intense racism towards Indigenous Australians which was a part of everyday life in Moree and how it influenced her strong opposition to all forms of discrimination; indeed, Moree was the site of a violent conflict during the Freedom Ride of 1965.

In 1951, H.V. Evatt passed through Moree to campaign for the "no" case in the 1951 referendum, at which the Menzies Liberal government was attempting to alter the Constitution of Australia in order to ban the Australian Communist Party. Evatt was addressing a small crowd from the back of a blue Holden ute, discussing the upcoming referendum and the Constitution, and Gaudron, not knowing what Evatt was referring to, asked "Please sir, what's a Constitution?" to which Evatt explained that it was "the laws by which Parliaments were governed." Gaudron asked whether it was similar to the Ten Commandments, and Evatt replied that "you could call it the Ten Commandments of government." Gaudron then asked for a copy, and Evatt subsequently sent her one in the mail; Gaudron, expecting two stone tablets, was disappointed to receive only a small pamphlet. However, when the school bullies declared the pamphlet useless, Gaudron retorted that it was of great use to lawyers, and that some day she would be one.

Education.

Gaudron was educated at St Ursula's College in Armidale.

In 1960 she was awarded a federal government scholarship to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Sydney, which she graduated with in 1962. In 1961 she had also commenced a part-time Bachelor of Laws degree, graduating in 1965 with first-class honours and the University's Medal for Law. Gaudron was the second female recipient, after Elizabeth Evatt, and the first female part-time student to be awarded the medal. Gaudron's lecturers there had included her future High Court colleague, Anthony Mason.

While studying, Gaudron attempted to obtain articles of clerkship (then five years in duration), but was not successful; as she later said, "Many distinguished lawyers took a lot of trouble and effort to explain to me that it was not their policy to take on women as articled clerks." Instead she took a job with the Government of Australia, although, in accordance with the public service regulations, she was sacked when she married.

When Gaudron graduated with her law degree, she was pregnant with her first daughter, Danielle.

In 1988, Gaudron was awarded an honorary doctorate in law from Macquarie University, and another from the University of Sydney in 1999.

Career.
Barrister.
Gaudron was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in October 1968 after having completed her articles of clerkship, and commenced practice as a barrister. She attempted to buy a room for herself in one of the barristers' chambers in Sydney, but was regularly knocked back because she was a woman. When future High Court colleague Michael McHugh attempted to sell his room, the other members of his chambers would not let Gaudron buy it, although there were no other buyers. She eventually shared a room with Janet Coombs, another pioneering female barrister. Gaudron regularly argued before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court in the early 1970s, particularly in the area of industrial law. In 1972 she became the first woman to be appointed to the Council of the New South Wales Bar.

One of Gaudron's most significant cases as a barrister was in 1972, when she successfully argued the Equal Pay case for the Whitlam Labor government before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

Early in 1972, Gaudron had entered a bar with a male barrister friend when the waitress informed the friend that the bar did not serve women. Gaudron "patiently explained to the barmaid that my friend didn't want a woman because he'd brought his own," eventually creating "something of a scene" which attracted the attention of Labor politician Clyde Cameron, who said that he didn't realise that such sexual discrimination still existed. Gaudron then said that "the discrimination being practised in that particular hotel was nothing compared to the discrimination over which he would undoubtedly preside when he became Minister for Industrial Relations after the next election." However, the Whitlam government was elected on 2 December, and Cameron duly became Minister for Industrial Relations, Whitlam called Gaudron on 3 December to hire her to argue the case.

The case, begun by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and supported by the Whitlam government when it came to power late in the year, extended the reach of the original but limited equal pay decision of 1969. Prior decisions had guaranteed equal pay only for certain specific occupations, and later certain limited industries (industries traditionally considered 'women's work', such as the textile industry), whereas this case extended the principle of equal pay to all workers. Gaudron's argument was based on the principles of the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention of the International Labour Organization (the organisation which she would later come to work for), although Gaudron later came to regard her own argument, that Australia had not ratified the Convention because the Commission would not grant equal pay (thus preventing Australia from fulfilling its obligations under the Convention), as somewhat disingenuous, and recalled it with a measure of embarrassment.

Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

In April 1974, Gaudron herself was appointed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as Deputy President, becoming the youngest ever federal judge. It was rumoured that Cameron had advocated in Cabinet for her appointment, first by emphasising her outstanding academic record, but then by noting her humble working class background, to which Whitlam supposedly said, "Next you'll be telling us she was born in a bloody manger!"

By the time of her appointment, Gaudron had given birth to her second daughter, Julienne. Gaudron's most notable case on the Arbitration Commission was an important test case for maternity leave in 1979, which laid down award standards allowing for a year's unpaid leave for all full-time and permanent part-time workers. In 1979, Gaudron was the inaugural chair of the New South Wales Legal Services Commission. Gaudron held the position of Deputy President until her resignation in May 1980.

Lecturer, QC and Solicitor-General.

Gaudron then lectured at the University of New South Wales' law school, but only for a brief time, as in February 1981 she was appointed the Solicitor-General of New South Wales, the first female Solicitor-General in any Australian jurisdiction. Also that year, she was made a Queen's Counsel (QC), the first female QC in New South Wales. Gaudron was soon married a second time, and later gave birth to a son, Patrick. In her capacity as Solicitor-General, Gaudron argued for New South Wales in such landmark High Court cases as the Tasmanian Dams case and the Actors Equity case.

From 1981 to 1986, Gaudron served on the Council of Macquarie University, and from 1984 to 1986, chaired an advisory council at the University of Wollongong.

High Court Justice.

After the death of Justice Lionel Murphy in October 1986, and the retirement of Chief Justice Harry Gibbs in February 1987, two vacancies were created on the High Court, and on 6 February 1987, John Toohey and Gaudron were appointed to the court. At just 44 years of age, Gaudron was the fourth youngest Justice, after Evatt, McTiernan and Dixon.

As a High Court Justice, Gaudron contributed to every area of Australian law, although most notably to Australian criminal law, in judgments that "combine technical mastery with a general tendency to insist on strict compliance by trial judges with their obligations in directing juries." Gaudron was an important part of the progressive Mason and Brennan courts, which decided such influential cases as Cole v Whitfield, Dietrich v The Queen and the Mabo case. Gaudron has consistently been opposed to all forms of discrimination, with notable judgments in this vein including the decision in Street v Queensland Bar Association (on Section 117 of the Australian Constitution) and her joint judgment with Justice McHugh in Castlemaine Tooheys v South Australia.

She was generally regarded as not particularly emotive in her writing style, although the judgment for which she is perhaps best remembered popularly was in the Mabo case, where in joint judgment with Justice Deane, she said that Australia's past treatment of Indigenous Australians was "the darkest aspect of the history of this nation."

Retirement.
On 21 June 2002, Gaudron announced her retirement from the High Court, effective from 10 February 2003. She left the court at the age of just 60 (the mandatory retirement age is 70). Gaudron's early retirement was lamented by all areas of the legal profession. Justice Michael Kirby, who was a close friend of Gaudron, has stated many times that her absence left the court with a different character, turned it into "a more blokey place".

In March 2003, Gaudron joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2004 she was a member of an inquiry into trade union rights in Belarus. She was also appointed as a judge of the ILO's Administrative Tribunal. In 2005, the International Labour Conference renewed her term until 30 June 2008.

Criticism.

Gaudron has been occasionally criticised throughout her career. At the time of her appointment to the High Court in 1987, the New South Wales legal magazine Justinian published anonymous remarks saying that "a melancholy catalogue of sins of omission and commission as well as the better claims of others" ought to have weighed against her appointment, and that she held "an emotional disposition inappropriate in a holder of judicial office." When she announced her retirement, an anonymous academic said that Gaudron had failed to achieve the expectations set by her supporters, and that among the other High Court Justices, Gaudron was "erratic" and "certainly not among the court's greats." Another anonymous academic said that Gaudron's Labor connections had delivered unearned promotion.

Approbation.

Yet despite this consistently anonymous criticism, Gaudron has also received much praise. Former President of the New South Wales Bar, Ruth McColl, described Gaudron's contribution to Australian law as "an extraordinarily humanising effect... the strong views she expresses in cases involving discrimination and like issues, are very influential and important in the development of the law in those areas." The Anti-Discrimination Commissioner of Tasmania, Jocelynne Scutt, said that "her contribution has been outstanding both as a jurist and as an advocate. And it has been profoundly significant in terms of her being a woman, too". Former Chief Justice Anthony Mason remarked that Gaudron's "contribution just can't be described as symbolic", but rather she had "made a very significant and genuine contribution" to Australian law.

In her own assessment, Gaudron described herself in 2005 as privileged "to be a bit player in the maintenance of the rule of law in Australia."

A pooram (the name coming from the Malayalam language used by the people of Kerala state of India) is an annual temple festival, usually held after the harvest in summer, has its origin from Poora Kali prevalent in Malabar area of Kerala state.  During the festival, there will be at least one ornately decorated elephant paraded in the procession. There some poorams and temple festivals without the parade of elephants (for example Aryankavu Pooram, near Shoranur, Kerala).  By far, the most famous Pooram is Thrissur Pooram. This festival has gained popularity in Europe and North America after the emergence of Kerala as a major tourism destination in South Asia.  The other famous pooram include Arattupuzha - Peruvanam Pooram, Nenmara vallangi vela, Wadakkancherry pooram and Edakkunni Uthram Vilakku.  This festival is often called Vela as well.

Musical Ensembles of Pooram.



 A melam is a classic performance of different kind of musical instruments that are unique to Kerala, and is something akin to the jazz.  The most traditional of all melams is called  Pandi Melam which is generally performed outside the Hindutemples, during the festival. Another kind of melam is called Panchari Melam, which is similar to Pandi Melam, but played inside the temple. The more scientifically orchestrated Panchari Melam is performed at many temple festivals such as Edakkunnni Uthramvilakku, near Ollur in Trichur district of Kerala. See the British Library archive for more details on this.

 Panchavadyam (pancha in Sanskrit means five) is another classical musical ensemble performed in Kerala.  Here, five different kinds of instruments are involved in a breathtaking and fastmoving percussion act of musical performance. The five instruments are Madhalam, Kombu, Edakka, Elathalam & Timila.

 Thayambaka is a solo Chenda (drum) performance, where the performer uses one stick and the other hand to play the instrument instead of the usual two sticks.

The first professional baseball team from Leavenworth, Kansas was the Leavenworth Soldiers. The club played in the Western League from 1886 to 1888. Their first year, they tied the Lincoln Tree Planters for last place at 31-49 despite the presence of Jake Beckley, who hit .341 and led the Western League with 113 hits while showing some pop. In 1887, the Soldiers were 27-27 when they disbanded on July 8 due to poor attendance. Beckley had another fine year, hitting .401 with 33 doubles between Leavenworth and Lincoln. In 1888, Leavenworth returned to the loop and went 7-7 under L. M. Cretors. They were in second place when the league stopped operations on June 21. A J.

Shemekia Copeland (b Harlem, New York City, 10 April 1979) is an American blues singer.

The daughter of blues guitarist and singer Johnny Copeland, she began to pursue a singing career in earnest at age 16, when her father's health began to decline; he took Shemekia on tour as his opening act, which helped establish her name on the blues circuit. 

She landed a record deal with Alligator, which issued her debut album "Turn the Heat Up!" in 1998.  The record was met with enthusiastic reviews, and she toured the blues festival circuit in America and Europe. Her second album, "Wicked", was released in 2000 and featured a duet with one of her heroes, early R&B diva Ruth Brown. It earned her three W.C. Handy Awards.

Winthrop Ellsworth Stone (1862-July 17, 1921) was the president of Purdue University from 1900-1921.

Born in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, to Frederick and Ann (Butler) Stone, he was the older brother of Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone.

He attended Amherst High School and Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), where he received his degree in 1882.

He studied chemistry and biology at Boston University and the University of Göttingen.  He received his Ph.D. from Göttingen in 1888, and was appointed chair of the chemistry department of Purdue University in 1889.  After serving as Purdue's first vice president, he became president of the university in 1900.  During Stone's tenure, Purdue's schools of agriculture and engineering grew rapidly.

President Stone was present at one of Purdue's worst tragedies, the "Purdue Wreck".  On October 31, 1903, a series of specials operated by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad - the "Big Four Railroad", were chartered to take over 1,000 people from Lafayette Indiana to Indianapolis Indiana for the annual Indiana University / Purdue University football game.  The entire Purdue football team had the place of honor by riding in the first coach of the lead special.  President Stone was seated in one of the last coach cars of the same train.  As the lead special rounded a curve near 18th Street in Indianapolis, it collided with a coal train which had been allowed to back onto the main line due to a lapse in communication.  The wooden coach where the football team was seated was crushed between a coal tender and the second coach, which carried Purdue's marching band.  Many of the other cars derailed.  In all, 17 people were killed, including 14 players from the football team.  President Stone and the other passengers tended those who were injured or dying.

Dr. Stone's children were David Frederick Stone (1890-1987) and Richard Stone.
His wife Victoria left him in 1907, travelling overseas to study philosophy.

Dr. Stone and his wife Margaret (married in 1912) enjoyed mountaineering and climbed extensively in the Canadian Rockies and Selkirks.  On July 17, 1921, Stone fell to his death from the summit of Mt. Eon, Alberta, shortly after completing the peak's first ascent.

<doc id="236175" title="Vishnu Sarma" nonfiltered="9" processed="9" dbindex="1500008">

Vishnu Sarma was the author of the anthropomorphic political treatise called Panchatantra. 

Vishnu Sarma lived in Varanasi (a city in the present day state of Uttar Pradesh) at around 200 BC. He was a Sanskrit scholar and the official Guru of the then prince of Kasi. He wrote the Panchatantra to teach political science to his royal young disciples. The Panchatantra is one of the oldest collections of Indian fables surviving today.

----

There was a large thriving city called Mahilaropya in the southern parts of our great country. There ruled a philanthropic, just and good ruler with the name of Amarashakti. He had no limit of money collected through just means, hillocks of precious gems and gold coins, but one sadness always used to inflict him, and that was that all is sons were complete fools. Though he had named them against their qualities - Bahushakti (the one with abundant power), Ugrashakti (the one with passionate* strength) and Anantashakti (the one with limitless strength) but that did not help them get over their abysmal intelligence and they remained asinines, without a shred of wisdom and consummate foolish.

The king called all his ministers and courtiers for consultation. At that moment, there were more than five hundred salaried teachers in his kingdom, a rarity in those days where teachers had to live on alms. But there was not one amongst them who could provide the correct education to the princes. After a lot of deliberation, a minister called Sumati (the one with the correct wisdom) suggested to appoint Acharya Vishnusharma as the official instructor for the princes. Vishnusharma was known to be a savant in all the shastras and the theory of politics and diplomacy. 

Acting on the suggestion, the king called Acharya Vishnusharma and declared that if he is able to make his sons into able administrators, he would gift him a hundred villages and gold without bound. The humble teacher laughed and replied, "Oh King! I do not sell my education. I have no desire of any gift. You have called me with respect and deference, therefore I pledge to make your sons into able administrators within 6 months. If I fail to fulfill my pledge, I would change my name." The king happily gave the responsibility of the three princes to him and continued with his work. Vishnusharma, however, realised that it was more difficult than he had thought to teach his new students through conventional means, and there was a need of a creative way of teaching. Therefore he made many short stories, each with a lesson, and tied them in 5 parts, called tantras. This collection, that has attained fame over centuries, is called Panchatantra. 

The five tantras in the book are Mitrabhed, Mitrasamprapti, Kakolookeeyam, Labdhapranasham, and Apareekshitkarakam. After listening and working on these stories, all the three princes became completely educated in politics and became able administrators.

A Googlewhack is a Google search query consisting of two words--both of which must be in Google's dictionary, and without quotation marks--that returns a single result. A successful Googlewhack returns 'Results 1-1 of 1'. Googlewhacking is the pastime of seeking such a result. A person attempting to find a Googlewhack is known as a Googlewhacker.

Cultural references.
Since 2003, British comedian Dave Gorman has toured Britain, France, Australia, Canada and the United States with a show entitled Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure, and published a book of the same name. These were based on a true story. While attempting to write a novel for his publisher (Random House) Dave became obsessed with Googlewhacks and traveled across the world finding people who had authored them. Although he never wrote his novel, he did eventually write a book about his "Googlewhack adventure" which went on to be a Sunday Times #1 best seller in the UK and has also been published in the U.S. and Canada. A translation is in the works for Japan.

Some of the googlewhacks used by Dave Gorman in his book are Francophile Namesakes,  ,  s,  ,  .

Participants at Googlewhack.com discovered the sporadic "cleaner girl" bug in Google's search algorithm where "results 1-1 of thousands" were returned for two relatively common words. Further details can be found at: Googlewhack NACK!

Variations.
New Scientist has discussed the idea of a Googlewhackblatt, which is similar to a Googlewhack however it involves finding a single word that produces only one Google result. Lists of these have become available, but as with Googlewhacks they result in the Googlewhackblatt status of the word being destroyed - unless it is blocked by robots.txt or the word doesn't produce any Google results before it is added to the list, thus forming the Googlewhackblatt Paradox. Those words that do not produce any Google search results at all are known as Antegooglewhackblatts before they are listed - and subsequently elevated to Googlewhackblatt status if it is not blocked by robots.txt.

Feedback stories are also available on the New Scientist website, thus resulting in the destruction of any existing Googlewhackblatts that are ever printed in the magazine. Antegooglewhackblatts that are posted on the Feedback website become known as Feedbackgooglewhackblatts as their Googlewhackblatt status is created.

In addition, New Scientist has more recently discovered another way to obtain a googlewhackblatt without falling into the Googlewhackblatt Paradox. One can write the googlewhackblatt on a website, but backwards, and then search on elgoog to view the list properly while still keeping the googlewhackblatt's status as a googlewhackblatt.

It is important to note that in contrast to Googlewhacks, many Googlewhackblatts and Antegooglewhackblatts are nonsense words that cannot presently and probably will never be found in a dictionary.

Vaginal Davis (born February 23, 1969) is a punk rock drag queen and an avant-garde performance artist. She has performed with such artists as Lisa Crystal Carver, Margaret Cho, and Beck, and has collaborated with underground photographers/film makers Bruce LaBruce, Rick Castro, and with the performance artist Ron Athey.  She has more recently collaborated with the "Cheap" collective in Berlin, Germany.  Davis's name is an homage to the radical black feminist Angela Davis.  Journalist and musician Craig Lee bestowed the middle name Creme, but Davis prefers that people not use the name Vaginal Creme Davis.

Davis has a noteworthy musical career, and is associated with the formation of the queercore movement.  One of her first bands was Pedro, Muriel & Esther (PME), co-founded with Glen Meadmore, who recorded their first single for independent record label Amoeba Records. PME went on to record the CD The White To Be Angry with producer Steve Albini. Davis is also a founding member of Cholita with Alice Bag (of seminal 1970s punk band The Bags).  Davis and Bags also worked together in The Afro Sisters.  More recently, as a part of her collaboration with the Cheap experimental theater collective in Berlin, Davis formed a punk band called Ruth Fischer (Fischer was a leader in the German Communist Party).  

In her home town of Los Angeles, Davis is also known for hosting Club Sucker (1994-1999), and Bricktops (2003-2005) - the latter was inspired by Bricktop, one of the more fascinating figures of the 1920s and 1930s.

Davis has authored a number of underground films, including The White to Be Angry (1999), Designy Living (1994) and Three Faces of Women (1994), and appears in queer underground video classics such as Super 8 1/2 (Bruce LaBruce, 1994) and Hustler White (Bruce LaBruce and Rick Castro, 1998) and Rosa von Praunheim's Can I Be Your Bratwurst, Please? (1999).

Vaginal Davis is the editor of the noted zines Fertile La Toyah Jackson Magazine and Shrimp. Aside from her own zines, her writing (somewhere between casual philosophy and gossip) has appeared in many publications, including Glue (in which she had a gossip column), Ben Is Dead Magazine, the seminal queercore zine J.D.s, and the LA Weekly.  One of her stories was anthologized in The Best American Erotica of 2003, edited by Susie Bright.

She has recently claimed that Condoleezza Rice is her first cousin.

When a controller operates in discontinuous mode around a setpoint (for example turning an airconditioner on above a certain room temperature and turning it off below that temperature) there can be frequent undesirable oscillations between on and off (sometimes referred to as 'chatter') when the variable is close to the setpoint.  To solve this problem a neutral zone can be implemented between two set points (high and low) with the controller taking no action as long as the temperature is in the neutral zone.  According to Curtis (see Reference below) "The existence of such a Neutral Zone is an example of desirable hysteresis in a system." 


In the above figure the controller will take no action as long as the measured error is between  and .

For more information concerning Neutral zones or Controller modes, please refer to Johnson's book.

Note: a neutral zone is also called a deadband.

<doc id="2351529" title="2 inch Quadruplex videotape" nonfiltered="13" processed="13" dbindex="1500012">
2 inch Quadruplex (also called 2  Quad, or just quad, for short) was the first practical and commercially successful videotape format.  It was developed and released for the broadcast television industry in 1956 by Ampex, an American company based in Redwood City, California.  This format revolutionized television broadcast operations and production, since the only medium available to the TV industry before then was motion picture film used for kinescopes, which was much more costly to utilize, had lower image quality than videotape, and took time to develop as well.  

Since most West Coast network delays done by the TV networks at the time were done with film kinescopes that needed time for developing, the networks wanted a more practical, cost-effective, and quicker way to time-shift programming for later airing in the West Coast (as well as a general production medium that was not as costly or time-consuming to edit and develop as film).  These reasons were part of the motivation for designing a video recording technology that used magnetic tape, in this case, the 2 inch Quad.

The format gets its official name of Quadruplex from the fact that it uses 4 heads mounted on a headwheel spinning tranversely (width-wise) across the tape at a rate of 14,400 rpm for NTSC-standard Quad decks, and 15,000 rpm for those using the European PAL video standard.  This method was called quadrature scanning (as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats).  The tape ran at a speed of either 7.5 or 15 inches per second (190 or 380 mm/s), 15.625 inches per second (400 mm/s) PAL, and the audio, control, and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion on the edges of the tape.  The cue track was used either as a second audio track, or for recording cue tones or time code for editing.

A typical 4800 foot (1500 m) reel of 2 inch quad tape holds approximately 1 hour of recorded material at 15 inches per second (380 mm/s).



Each transversely-recorded track of video on a 2 inch Quad videotape holds one-sixteenth of a field of video.  In other words, the format used segmented recording.  This meant that 2 inch Quad was not capable of "trick-play" functions, such as still, shuttle, and reverse/variable-speed playback.  But the format had quite sufficient image quality for broadcast (it produced about 400 lines of video resolution), and remained the de-facto format and industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid-1980s, when newer, smaller, and lower-maintenance videotape formats supplanted the role of 2 inch quad.

There were 3 different variations of 2 inch Quad:

 Low-band, which was the first variety of Quad introduced by Ampex in 1956,
 High-band, which used a wider bandwidth for recording video to the tape, resulting in higher-resolution video from the VTR, and;
 Super High-band, which used a pilot tone for better timebase stability, and higher coercivity tape.

Most Quad machines made later in the 60s and 70s by Ampex could playback both low and high-band 2 inch Quad tape.

The beginning of Quad.

At the beginning of the 1950's, several companies along with Ampex, such as Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), and RCA were all competing to release a videotape format.  RCA and BCE did release working prototypes of their recorders, but their downfall was that they all used a longitudinal (stationary-head) method of recording, much like audio tape recorders.  This meant that the tape had to be recorded at a ludicrously high speed (around 120 in/s) in order to record a sufficient amount of bandwidth to reproduce an adequate video image (at least 2-3 MHz for a watchable image), in turn requiring large amounts of tape on large reels used by these early machines from RCA and BCE.  In Britain at that time, the BBC developed a similar stationary-head VTR system that saw some on-air use, called VERA (Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus).

Plus, time-shifting of television programming for the West Coast by the networks at the time (in order to broadcast their programming at the same local time in the East and West Coasts) using film kinescopes was quite a rushed and perilous ordeal. This was due to there being only 3 hours for the West Coast branches of the TV networks to receive video for the programming from the East Coast (live via leased microwave relay or coaxial cable circuits provided from the phone company (AT&T) at the time), and then to record such to film kinescopes, and lastly to develop the film to be aired 3 hours later on the West Coast.  This usually meant the kinescope film was aired almost immediately after it came straight out of the developing equipment, still warm from the film dryer used to dry the film prints coming out of the developing chemicals.  These were referred to by the networks as "hot kines".  According to the History of Tape Recording website, the networks used more raw film stock for kinescope delays for the West Coast than all of the Hollywood film studios combined.  They were desperate to obtain a quicker, less expensive, and more practical solution.

Ampex, seeing the impracticality of the prototype BCE and RCA VTRs, started to develop a more practical videotape format with tape economy in mind, as well as providing a solution to the networks' West Coast delay woes.  Starting in 1952, Ampex built the Mark I prototype VTR, using 2 inch wide tape.  Ampex decided that instead of having the tape move fast across the head to record enough bandwidth for video, that the head move fast across the tape instead.  This resulted in the Mark I using arcuate scanning, which consisted of a spinning disk, where its face (where the heads were mounted) was in contact with the tape (as opposed to the edge of the headwheel with transverse quadrature scanning).  This resulted in an arc-shaped track being recorded across the width of the tape.  Arcuate scanning resulted in a head-to-tape speed of about 2500 in/s, but problems with timebase stability of the reproduced video signal from the tape led Ampex to abandon arcuate scanning in favor of the more reliable transverse scanning system.

Ampex soldiered on throughout the mid-50s with the Mark II and Mark III prototype recorders, which now used transverse scanning.  The Mark II used frequency modulation for recording video to tape, resulting in a much-improved, but still noisy video image (the Mark I had used amplitude modulation), and the Mark III had improved signal-processing and servo electronics, resulting in perfect video being reproduced from the machine.  

The Mark III worked perfectly, but its appearance was quite that of a prototype, and not a finished, saleable product.  It was in a makeshift wooden case, with several parts of its chassis externally mounted in partially-filled racks.  So, Ampex went on to integrate all of this into a sleek metal console and fully-populated rack-mount cases, and this became the Mark IV.

The Mark IV was the machine for the first public demonstration of the 2 inch Quad format, at the NARTB (now the NAB) convention in Chicago on April 14, 1956.  The earlier Mark III was given some cosmetic improvements, and was also demonstrated at Ampex headquarters in Redwood City the same day.  Both demonstrations were a success, and as a result, Ampex was swamped with orders for the new 2 inch Quad VTR.



Ampex later released the first manufactured models of Quad VTR based on the Mark IV which were also prototypes, the VRX-1000, of which 16 were made.  Machines made afterward were the final production models, and were designated as the VR-1000.

Shortly after Ampex's introduction of the 2 inch quad format, RCA in 1957 introduced a Quad-compatible VTR, the TRT-1A.  RCA referred to it as a "Television Tape Recorder", since the word "Videotape" was a trademark of Ampex at the time.

Later on, Ampex would release later models of their Quad decks, such as the second-generation VR-2000 in 1967, and the AVR series of VTRs, AVR-1, AVR-2, and AVR-3 in the 1970s.  The AVR-2 was the most compact of Quad VTRs, and could run off on regular 120 volt single-phase household-type AC power (Quad VTRs before then required 208 or 220-volt 3-phase AC power).

RCA would also release later models of Quad VTRs as well, such as the TR-22 and TR-600.

CBS was the first television network to use 2 inch Quad videotape, using it for a West Coast delay of Douglas Edwards and the News on November 30, 1956.  CBS would also delay for the west coast the first entertainment tv program on videotape, The Edsel Show, on October 13, 1957.

The developing engineers at Ampex that worked on 2 inch Quadruplex videotape from the Mark I to the VR-1000 were Charles Ginsburg, Alex Maxey, Fred Pfost, Shelby Henderson, Charlie Anderson, and Ray Dolby (who later went on to found Dolby Laboratories).

2 inch Quad today.

Nowadays, 2 inch Quad is no longer used as a mainstream format in TV broadcasting and video production, having been supplanted by more modern, easier-to-use, more practical and lower-maintenance formats like 1" Type C (1976), U-matic, Betacam, DVCAM, DVCPro, and HDCAM.

When it was in use, 2 inch Quad VTRs needed ongoing maintenance, usually 3-phase power to operate (as mentioned earlier), plus an air compressor to provide air pressure for the air bearing that the spinning transverse headwheel rode on due to its high rotational speed (some Quad VTRs, such as the portable Ampex VR-3000, used ball bearings instead due to the lack of availability of compressed air, but these wore out quickly). They also required constant calibration of the discrete electronics used by the older Quad VTRs in order to maintain a high-quality picture suitable for broadcast. The operator was a much more skilled technician than today's "pop-in-a-cassette" operators. These machines required quite a bit of set up in order to make a quality recording and a broadcast quality image for playback.

2 inch Quad VTRs today are not used for broadcast or production service. The few that remain in service are now used by video archives and transfer services, for the transfer and/or restoration of 2 inch quad videotape material to a newer format.

<doc id="6863743" title="F1 Rejects" nonfiltered="20" processed="20" dbindex="1500019">
Formula One Rejects (F1 Rejects) is a Formula One website dedicated to, statistically, the worst drivers and teams in Formula One history. It features over 100 driver profiles and over 15 teams who set standards for mediocrity in F1 with their results. All one has to do to escape eligibility from being a "F1 Reject" is to either: 
Score a 1st through 4th place finish, or;
One 5th and another top-6 result, or three or more 6th places.  ;

Although there is an "un-written rule" in the criteria which was addressed during the "Off-season" podcast, January 21 2007, where a listener of F1 Rejects asked why drivers who had lost their lives while driving a Formula One car and were eligible for Reject status, Roger Williamson and Tony Brise for example, were not listed on the "Rejects drivers" page. This would explain why an article on Roland Ratzenberger is in the "Reject Centrale" section instead.

The site was created in 1999 by Australians Jamie McGregor, the site's webmaster, and Enoch Law, the "Senior Grand Prix Analyst", who is the author of most of the material on the site.

Focus on Current F1.
The site features a page called Reject Centrale, which is home to the reviews of the last Grand Prix held and every Grand Prix held since the beginning of the 2000 season. There are also feature articles, which either the site author or webmaster has created.  Later on the page there are submitted articles from readers of the website.

At the beginning and end of the year, F1 Rejects does both an F1 season preview and review. The season preview is a team-by-team synopsis of their predictions for the season, while the season review offers thoughts and driver-by-driver summaries, with the bottom three-ranked drivers completing that year's "Reject Podium" (see Reject of the Year).

Reject of the Race.
This award was created after the 2000 French Grand Prix. On the last corner of the circuit, Benetton driver Alexander Wurz made a move on the inside of Jean Alesi's Prost, and ran out of track into the gravel trap. His maneuver led to the birth of "Reject of the Race". This "award" has been given out to many drivers, teams, tyres, even engines (2006 Japanese Grand Prix - Schumacher's engine) and inanimate objects, the latter happening at the 2005 Chinese Grand Prix.

Reject of the Year.
In each year's season review, the three bottom-ranked drivers complete the Reject Podium.  The driver who, by a combination of poor results, a lack of outright speed, and failure to meet expectations will likely be crowned that year's Reject of the Year.  



F1 Rejects Podcasts.
Since August 4, 2005, F1 Rejects have been broadcasting podcasts, where McGregor and Law sit down and had a chat about the latest Grand Prix.  Topics of discussion have included the latest news in F1, "Great Moments in F1 Punditry", where a clip of some "reject-worthy" moment is played, the most popular being quotes from James Hunt, and a bit of history about the Grand Prix.

Praise and Criticisms.
F1 Rejects is well known within the world of F1 fans on the internet. The site has been praised for its humorous and critical profiling of drivers. The site has been praised for looking at their drivers in a non malicious manner. 

Many drivers and teams with short careers in the sport have lengthy profiles on the site. Profiles are very informative, and contain facts about the driver or teams career prior to F1, and after (if known). The site has been praised for its high level of knowledge and research used to find details on relatively obscure drivers.

At the A1 Grand Prix meeting at Eastern Creek, Australia in November 2005, the site managed to arrange an interview with "rejects" Andrea Montermini and Alex Yoong.

The site has been accused of Schadenfreude by some critics. However, supporters of the site dispute this, stating that F1 Rejects gives praise to drivers who large fanbases have viewed as poor. An example of this is  Alex Yoong, who whilst being slower than teammates Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber and being in F1 purely down to wealthy backing, has been viewed with lots of sympathy from F1 Rejects due to his circumstances with Minardi during this period.

Similarly, F1 Rejects have been accused of several driver biases, notably against Juan Pablo Montoya, Giancarlo Fisichella, and Ralf Schumacher. However, supporters state that these so-called "biases" are merely reflecting their disappointment on the driver underperforming, rather than being outright critical of them. In their podcast for the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, both Jamie and Enoch decided to respond to these criticisms by highlighting some of Ralf Schumacher's best races, such as the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix. Similarly, the site authors nominated themselves for their "Reject of the Race" award after Giancarlo Fisichella's impressive drive to third in the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix, reflecting the good natured humour of the website.

Publicocrapometer.

F1 Rejects have also produced the Publicocrapometer. It is an imaginary machine that alerts people to 'publicocrap', their term for media statements from drivers and teams which are overblown and publicity-seeking. However it completely failed when it highlighted Honda Racing F1 repeatedly in 2006 when they claimed they'd win a Grand Prix, only for Jenson Button to win the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Camptosomata is a group of leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) that carry a case of waste material as larvae.  This group consists of two subfamilies of leaf beetle: Lamprosomatinae and Cryptocephalinae (formally Cryptocephalinae, Chlamisinae, and Clytrinae).  Each case begins as a wrapping that the mother creates by laying plates of fecal material each egg.  She begins at one end of the egg and turns it with the addition of eah plate.  She then closes it by creating a "roof" at the other end.  When the larva hatches from the egg, it opens the roof of the egg case.  it then extends it head and legs from this opening, flips the case over its back and crawls away.  Larval camptosomates add to and expand this case with their own waste materials as they grow.  They eventually seal off the opening where their head and legs were and pupate inside.  When they metamorphose into adults, these beetles then cut a circle around the apex of the case, pop off the cap, and crawl out, ready to feed, mate, and start the cycle over again.

Bert is a fictional character, a Muppet on the Public Broadcasting Service's long-running children's television show, Sesame Street.

Bert was originally performed by Frank Oz.  Since 2001, Muppeteer Eric Jacobson has been phased in as Bert's primary performer.

He and his friend and roommate Ernie form a comic duo that is one of the program's centerpieces, with Bert acting the world-weary foil to Ernie's naïve trouble-maker. A characteristic physical feature of Bert is his unibrow.

Characteristics.
Personality.
Bert, though intelligent, is also grumpy, boring, easily frustrated and yellow. He enjoys activities such as paper clip and bottle cap collecting, cooking oatmeal and watching pigeons. In one sketch, Bert reads a book called "Boring Stories" and chuckles, "Boy, these Boring Stories are really exciting!" In the book Sesame Street Unpaved, Frank Oz says, "I was never really happy with Bert's character until about a year in, when I realized... that he was a very boring character, and I'd use that weakness as a strength for him."

Bert has a pet pigeon named Bernice, and he created a dance called "Doin' the Pigeon".

A typical "Bert and Ernie" skit has Ernie coming up with a hare-brained idea and Bert attempting to talk him out of it, ending with Bert completely losing his temper and Ernie remaining oblivious to his own bad idea.

Bert has a twin brother, Bart, a nephew, Brad, and an Aunt Matilda. Brad (presumed to be played by Richard Hunt) had a voice like Beaker, but slightly deeper, and while he still made baby-like noises, he was able to talk. Ernie brought a toy shark with him in one skit; Brad was scared by it, not realising it was a toy. Bart looks exactly like Bert Ernie once mistook Bart for Bert but Bart wears a suit and fedora and is a salesman ("Bart's the name and selling's my game!").

The age of Bert and Ernie is regularly discussed on forums. Nothing official has ever been said, but most consider the duo adults, as they do not appear to be highly dependent on others. Helping suggestions of the characters being young is a comment by Sesame Street Live performer Taylor Morgan. Morgan said to the Macon Telegraph that "I just kind of try to think like a 6-year-old or 7-year-old, because that's how old Bert is." 

Sexuality.
Ernie and Bert share an apartment in the basement of 123 Sesame Street. Although they sleep in separate beds, this has led to the occasional suggestion that they are representations of gay lovers. Sesame Workshop, the corporation that owns the show and the characters, denies this and is occasionally compelled to point out that Bert and Ernie are made from cloth and other materials, and have no sexuality whatsoever.

Despite this, some continue to insist that the relationship between Bert and Ernie are more than "just friends." A number of individuals have used this suggestion as fodder in popular culture parodies, including:

 Saturday Night Live   On a "Weekend Update" segment, Chevy Chase read a news story about Ernie and Bert "coming out of the closet.";

 "Avenue Q"   The character of Rod is based on Bert and is a closeted homosexual.

 Family Guy   Bert and Ernie were featured as gay lovers in the episode "Mind over Murder," as part of a parody called "Homicide: Life on Sesame Street" (which also satirized ). Bert a gruff, foul-mouthed, hard-drinking detective is called at 3 a.m. to the scene of a homicide in front of Hooper's Store. He scolds Ernie for eating cookies in bed (a parody of a classic skit).

Mad TV   The fourth episode of season 12 of Mad TV that aired on November 4, 2006 had a parody of Sesame Street that depicted Bert as an internet predator on a Myspace parody website called Myplace.

Cultural impact.

A humor website "Bert is Evil" hosted digitally manipulated images and satiric articles as "evidence" of Bert being evil. The site depicted the Muppet consorting with Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan and present at the Hindenburg disaster. The site drew worldwide attention in 2001 when a photo of a Bangladeshi street protest was distributed by the Reuters news agency; the photo included a protest sign that depicted Bert with Osama bin Laden, an image that had been inadvertently placed there by the owner of a poster shop in Dhaka. Although the Bert-with-Osama image never appeared on "Bert is Evil,"  owner Dino Ignacio took the site off-line anyway.

The song and dance "Doin' the Pigeon" inspired an end zone dance by San Francisco 49ers defensive back Merton Hanks.

In Germany the TV comedy show "Freitag Nacht News" featured a series of sketches with "Bernie und Ert" as two puppets in leather gear entering a sex club. These episodes were highly popular and are still a sought item  for filesharers. German comic artist OL made several parodies about Ernie and Bert as gay workmen from Poland.

Trivia.

According to Henson, Bert and Ernie were not named after characters of the same name from the classic Christmas movie It's a Wonderful Life. 


Discography.
As the duo often sing in their skits, several albums were released containing studio-recorded versions of their songs. Bert's best-known song is Doin' the Pigeon. Additionally, he and Ernie both had their own video, The Best of Ernie and Bert, and their own album, Bert and Ernie's Greatest Hits . He also has a few of his own albums, such as Bert's Blockbusters and The Best of Bert).

<doc id="3183204" title="HTTP-Tunnel" nonfiltered="27" processed="27" dbindex="1500026">
HTTP-Tunnel is a program that masks application data as HTTP traffic to bypass firewalls.  This is done by routing all outgoing traffic through port 80, the standard HTTP traffic port, and encapsulating this inside HTTP packets. Since almost all firewalls allow HTTP traffic to pass through, the masked application is allowed to communicate with remote hosts. HTTP-Tunnel uses encryption to maintain transfer security.

In order to mask application traffic with HTTP-Tunnel, the application must implement the SOCKS protocol. This protocol is implemented in several Peer-to-Peer clients, internet browsers, instant messaging applications, and other programs.

Usage.
HTTP-Tunnel allows firewall blocked applications to send and receive data from the internet. The firewall blocking the application must be on the side of the HTTP-Tunnel user, and not on that of the remote host. 

HTTP-Tunnel creates a tunnel -just as its name says- between the user's computer and the outer side of the user's firewall.

How it works.
Mediator servers.
HTTP-Tunnel uses mediator servers in order to maintain the tunnel. The HTTP-masked application data travels from the user's machine to the mediator servers. From that point, the data is converted into the original application traffic (the one the user's application understands) and forwarded to the remote host.

From the remote host's viewpoint, the traffic seems to come from the mediator servers.

Masking and routing process example.
In the following example, we will say a HTTP-Tunnel user called "Adam" has a program named "application X". This application works by connecting to a remote server called "application X server". Because Adam works in a firewalled office, application X's traffic is generally blocked, thus preventing the program from connecting to application X server.

The following would be the process of connecting application X to application X server using HTTP-Tunnel:

   1. Adam's machine HTTP-Tunnel client has opened a local port to work as a SOCKS server.
   2. Adam commands application X to establish a SOCKS session with HTTP-Tunnel client on the port the latter program is
      listening.
   3. The following occurs every time application X has data to send to application X server:
      3.1. The data is transformed inside application X into application X packets (following the application's network
           protocol) and handed to HTTP-Tunnel client.
      3.2. HTTP-Tunnel client masks application X packets as HTTP packets and sends them to HTTP-Tunnel mediator servers on
           port 80, just as if Adam was trying to open a webpage.
      3.3. Once the data is in HTTP-Tunnel mediator servers, it is translated into application X packets and forwarded to
           application X server.
      3.4. The data reaches application X server just as if it was sent by HTTP-Tunnel mediator servers.

The remote host will believe HTTP-Tunnel mediator servers sent the data. Because of this, every time the remote host wants to reply, it will do so sending data to HTTP-Tunnel mediator servers.

The SARFL is an Australian rules football competition and governing body based in Scotland.  It is an affiliate of the British Australian Rules Football League.

History.
There are rumours of a competition in the region of Clyde during the early 20th Century, famously referred to in 'A Game of their Own' (reference needed), where a number of expatriates were based here either as Ship Workers or Soldiers. Had this league existed, it died out around the time of the First World War.

During the 90s the Caledonian Sharks were set up by John Boland, but eventually folded.  The first lasting Scottish club of the modern era was known as the Edinburgh Puffins in 2003 with informal matches held, and invitiationals of clubs from the British Australian Rules Football League.

The inaugural SARFL season was held in 2004 and the league currently consists of 3 clubs, one from Glasgow and two from Edinburgh.  The 'Puffins' name instead conferred upon the Scottish national team.

In 2006, Glasgow and Edinburgh considered competing in the BARFL Regional competition, though travel problems saw them continue an expanded SARFL local competition with the Glasgow Redbacks and Middlesborough Hawks (England) joining the league.

National team.
The Puffins are Scotland's National Team and may compete in a future Australian Football International Cup.

<doc id="422026" title="Emperor Kang of Jin" nonfiltered="33" processed="32" dbindex="1500032">


Emperor Kang of Jin (   /   , pinyin Jìn K ngdì, Wade-Giles Chin K`ang-ti) (322-November 17 344), personal name Sima Yue (   ), courtesy name Shitong (  ), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (265-420). He was a son of Emperor Ming and younger brother (by the same mother) of Emperor Cheng.  His reign was brief -- only two years.

 Prior to reign .
Sima Yue was born in 322 as the second son of Emperor Ming, by his wife Empress Yu Wenjun.  After his father died in 325 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Cheng, Sima Yue was created the Prince of Wu in 326.  In 327, because his uncle Sima Yu the Prince of Langye wanted to yield that more honorific title, Sima Yu was created the Prince of Kuaiji and Sima Yue was created the Prince of Langye.  It is not known where Sima Yue was during the Su Jun Disturbance of 326-328 -- whether he was captured and held hostage like his emperor brother, at his principality of Wu (which Su Jun did not occupy), or elsewhere.  During his brother's reign, he received a progression of offices, but did not appear to actually participate in major decision-making.

In summer 342, Emperor Cheng grew gravely ill.  He had two young sons -- Sima Pi and Sima Yi, then still in cradles, by his concubine Consort Zhou.  Yu Bing (  ), one of the top two officials and Emperor Cheng's (and Sima Yue's) uncle, fearful that the Yus would lose power if a young emperor were named, persuaded Emperor Cheng that in the face of the powerful enemy Later Zhao that an older emperor should be named. Emperor Cheng agreed and designated Sima Yue the Prince of Langye, despite the other top official He Chong (  )'s opposition.  He died soon after, and Sima Yue took the throne as Emperor Kang.  (He did not make secret his opposition, and after Emperor Kang took the throne, when he thanked Yu and He for making him emperor, He stated, "The reason why Your Imperial Majesty can fly like a dragon is Yu Bing.  If I were listened to, we would not have this current prosperous reign."  Emperor Kang appeared humiliated, but did not retaliate against He (although He himself would request to become a local governor to avoid working with Yu Bing, and his request was granted) and continued to respect him.)

 Reign .
In early 343, Emperor Kang created his wife Chu Suanzi empress.

Later in 343, Emperor Kang's other uncle, Yu Yi (  ), proposed a major military campaign against Later Zhao, in coordination with Former Yan's ruler Murong Huang and Former Liang's ruler Zhang Jun, both nominal Jin vassals.  Most officials feared this large undertaking, but with support from Yu Bing, Huan Wen (Emperor Kang's brother-in-law, having married his sister Sima Xingnan (    ) the Princess Nankang), and Sima Wuji (    ) the Prince of Qiao, Emperor Kang approved the plan and mobilized troops.  Yu Bing was made a governor to coordinate with Yu Yi, and He Chong was recalled to replace him, and served in conjunction with Emperor Kang's father-in-law Chu Pou (  ) (who, however, soon yielded his post).  However, Yu Yi eventually, for reasons unknown, largely did not carry out his campaign, although he made some border attacks.

In fall 344, Emperor Kang grew ill.  Yu Bing and Yu Yi wanted to support his uncle Sima Yu the Prince of Kuaiji as emperor, but He Chong, consistent with his prior advice to Emperor Cheng, suggested that Emperor Kang should pass the throne to his son Sima Dan.  Emperor Kang agreed and created Sima Dan crown prince.  He died two days later, and was succeeded by the one-year-old Crown Prince Dan (as Emperor Mu).

"Mannish Boy" is a classic blues song by Muddy Waters. The song was a rearrangement of the classic Bo Diddley hit "I'm a Man". It was originally recorded and released in 1955 and later 1977 re-recorded in a memorable hit version that was produced by Johnny Winter, released on Muddy Waters' Hard Again album and in 1988 featured in a jeans TV commercial.  It was also the first track on the live album that Winter produced for Waters, with Waters and Winter sharing vocals on the song.

The same basic riff in "Mannish Boy" can also be heard on another Muddy Waters song: "Hoochie Coochie Man". This riff is common throughout the blues in both the 5 note and a shortened 4 note version.

A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.

The guitar riff also appears on George Thorogood's "Bad To The Bone".

The song was used in the movie "The Long Kiss Goodnight", starring Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis.

This song is also a part of the "Sunday, May 11th, 1980" montage in the movie Goodfellas.

<doc id="2120619" title="Jacek Yerka" nonfiltered="36" processed="35" dbindex="1500035">
Jacek Yerka is a Polish artist born in 1952. Yerka's work can be witnessed through Mind Fields, in which Harlan Ellison has provided narration for each of Yerka's selected pieces.

Painter Jacek Yerka was born in a Toru , city in Northern Poland in the early 1950s. His developing years were spent playing amidst the wonderfully preserved gothic architecture of medieval Europe, as his hometown was spared much of the bombing that beset Poland during the war. It is this environment of reddish brown brickwork that immediately calls to mind the works of Bosch and Brueghel, whose palette Yerka shares.

Yerka studied art at University, before rebelling against the trend to paint with less attention to realism and detail. Instead, he found his education studying the works of the Northern European masters like the Van Eycks, Dierck Bouts, Robert Campin, Bosch, and surrealists such as Magritte.

 
"I did my first painting of my life a year before going to college, where I began studying graphics. My instructors always tried to get me to paint in the more contemporary abstract style, and move away from my fascination with realism. I saw this as an attempt to stifle my own creative style and steadfastly refused to fall in line. Eventually, my teachers relented."

Yerka's carefully rendered paintings (acrylics on canvas) are filled with images from the artist's childhood, one heavily influenced by the surroundings of his home during the 1950's, and his grandmother's kitchen, wherein he spent much of his time. Odd little beasts, and wonderfully whimsical landscapes are the hallmarks of Yerka's delightful works.

"For me, the 1950's were a kind of Golden Age. These were the happy years of my childhood, filled with wonder at the world around me. It is reflected throughout my work in buildings, furniture, and various pre-war knickknacks. If I were, for instance, to paint a computer, it would definitely have a pre-war aesthetic to it."

 
Jacek Yerka's work has been exhibited in Poland, Germany, Monaco, France, and the United States. His works also hang in Polish art museums.

 
"Yerka's art brims with echoes of the famous surreal artists of the past, Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Brueghel to Salvador Dalí and René Magritte."

Siegfried Hausner (January 1952   24 April, 1975) was a student member of the German SPK (Socialist Patients' Collective) and later the terrorist Red Army Faction. 

As a Terrorist.
As a member of the SPK, Hausner was especially involved in the "working circle explosives." Hausner had some knowledge about explosives and, along with Carmen Roll managed to manufacture small amounts of TNT.

In February 1971, Hausner, along with Roll, planned to bomb the President of the Federal Republic s special train in Heidelberg station, but Roll arrived to late with the explosives and the plot fell through.   

Hausner went on to forge links with the RAF when the SPK dissolved even though for a time he was distrusted by Gudrun Ensslin (who at one point thought to liquidate him), however he proved his worth by helping Ulrike Meinhof and Ilse Stachowiak bomb the Axel Springer Verlag in Hamburg on 19 May, 1972. 

In 1975 Hausner was involved in the Occupation of the West German embassy in Stockholm. He supposedly supervised the whole operation and was in charge of the wiring of the TNT. He hadn t done quite a good job with the TNT as it exploded accidentally 12 hours into the occupation. Hausner was fatally wounded in the explosion and was immediately flown back to West Germany but died two hours later. 

Legacy.
When Siegfried Buback was assassinated in April 1977, the RAF claimed responsibility in honour of Ulrike Meinhof and Siegfried Hausner and the last video clip of kidnapped Hanns Martin Schleyer before he was murdered by the RAF in October 1977, showed Schleyer holding a placard that read;  Commando Siegfried Hausner,  in Hausner's honour. Also, although Operation Leo fell through, if it was successful, the terrorists who executed it would've named their Commando; Commando Siegfried Hausner.

<doc id="4290482" title="Pallas Athena (song)" nonfiltered="41" processed="40" dbindex="1500040">


"Pallas Athena" is a song written by David Bowie in 1993 for the album Black Tie White Noise. 

The name is taken from the Greek goddess, Athena, who famously depicted in Athenean statues under the form of Pallas Athena. Hence, the name of the song is a suggestion of religion and icons and sets the mood for a dark piece concerning the power that religion has over man.

The lyrics are rather sparse, but the phrase beginning the piece, "God is on top of it all, that's all," delivered as though from an African-American preacher, is ominous and intimidating, accompanied with the sound of strings delivering a sorrow melody. The piece develops into a techno dance piece, using string sounds to hold the ominous mood while overlayed atop bass and drums. David Bowie's saxophone playing is amplified into a scream-like sound, which solos, along with Lester Bowie on trumpet. A lyric, "We are, we are, we are, we are praying," is repeated through the close of the song in a somber, monk-like fashion. Ultimately, the song is evocative of major issues Bowie has addressed through his music: intolerance and submission.

Bowie used to play a drum'n'bass version of the song during his 1997 Earthling tour, and a live version recorded at Paradiso, Holland June 10 1997 was released as a single under the name Tao Jones Index, a very limited edition only available on 12" vinyl. Bowie played as Tao Jones Index during his performance in a dance tent at Phoenix Festival in 1997. It is a pun based on his birth name, David Jones, and his then recent bond offering to the Dow Jones Index. Tao, a Chinese character pronounced "dow," not only stands for the Chinese equivalent to Bowie's first initial, "D", but also has heavy religious implications through its correlation Taoism, therefore contributing to the religious overtones of "Pallas Athena."

<doc id="1880884" title="Georg von Frundsberg" nonfiltered="42" processed="41" dbindex="1500041">
Georg von Frundsberg (1473 1528) was a German Knight and landowner. He was born to Ulrich von Frundsberg and his wife Barbara von Rechberg at Mindelheim on September 24, 1473, into an old line of southern Tyrolean knights that settled in Oberschwaben. 

He fought for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I against the Swiss in the Swabian war of 1499, and in the same year was among the Imperial troops sent to assist Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, against the French. Still serving Maximilian, he took part in 1504 in the war over the succession to the duchy of Bavaria-Landshut, fighting against the Pfalz-Counts Philipp and Ruprecht.  He distinguished himself during the Battle of Regensburg.  King Maximilian I personally bestowed him with knighthood.  Later, he also fought in the Netherlands.  

Convinced of the necessity of a native body of trained infantry, Frundsberg assisted Maximilian to organize the Landsknechts.  One year later, he became the commander of the Landsknechts in the lower countries.  Thereafter, Frundsberg lived an uninterrupted life of war, campaigning for Empire and the Habsburgs.  In 1509, Frundsberg became the "Highest Field Captain" of the Landsknecht Regiment (occupation force) and participated in the war against Venice, winning fame for himself and his men after defending the City of Verona against numerous attacks.  

After a short visit to Germany he returned to Italy, where between 1513 and 1514 he gained fresh laurels by his enterprises against the Venetians and the French. Peace being made, he returned to Germany, and at the head of the infantry of the Swabian League assisted to drive Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg from his duchy in 1519. 

At the diet of Worms in 1521 he spoke words of encouragement to Martin Luther, and when the struggle between the German King Karl V fought Franz I of France, Frundsberg helped lead the Army into Picardy.  When Franz I appeared on the battlefield with a force of approximately 40,000 men, the clever withdrawal of the German King s army saved its existence.  Frundsberg considered the withdrawal on Valenciennes as "the greatest luck and most appropriate measure during war."  He then proceeded to Italy and brought the greater part of Lombardy under the influence of Charles V through his victory at the Battle of Bicocca in April 1522. 

After the French campaign in 1522 ended and Frundsberg resigned from the leadership of the Landesknechts, he returned to lead the march on upper Italy.  Within a short period, 6000 men followed the beat of his campaign drum and the magic in his name.  A difficult alpine crossing through deep snow led to the Battle of Biccocca near Mailand.  Swiss nationals on foot fought along side Frundsberg who led and fought from the front, together with the Swiss Arnold Winkelried.  The Kaiser's victory at Biccocca allowed for the return of the old Kingdom's Parliamentary Cabinet Lands of Genua and Mailand.

In 1525, after a brief stop in Mindelheim as the "Highest Field Captain" of the entire German Nation (consisting of 12,000 men and twenty-nine flag bearers), Frundsberg moved again towards upper Italy to relieve Pavias and to save the Reich's Duchy of Mailand.  Despite an additional 6000 men, of which some were Spanish, in battle against an enemy that was twice as strong, Frundsberg won his most famous victory at Pavia and crowned for the capture of the French King. 

Only one year later, when the war in Italy was renewed in 1526, Frundsberg received a call for help from the Kaiser's Army in Lombardei, to help decide the war.  Albeit an insufficient amount, he obtained 36,000 German Taler to organize the new army.  During his occupation of Mindelheim, Frundsberg borrowed money and sold-off his silver table-settings and his wife's jewelry, in order to acquire the remaining funds to raise the Army.  In less than three weeks, Frundsberg organized over 12,000 men and crossed the Alps during the middle of November.  He joined the Constable de Bourbon near Piacenza and marched towards Rome.  However, before he reached the Eternal city, near Modena on March 13 1527, order and discipline broke in 1527, when no decisive battle developed after months of campaigning in Italy.  Payment for the mercenaries remained overdue and in the end, even Frundsberg was unable to rally the Landsknechts and restore order.  The matter shook the old commander to such an extent that he suffered a stroke.  Unable to regain his physical strength, Frundsberg was moved to Germany after a long struggle in Italian hospitals.  Tormented by great anxiety over the situation with his mercenaries or  beloved sons , the loss of his personal estate and death of one of his sons, Frundsberg died on 20 August 1528, in his castle in Mindelheim. He was a capable and chivalrous soldier, and a devoted servant of the Habsburgs. 

His son Caspar (1500 1536) and his grandson Georg (d. 1586) were both soldiers of some distinction. With the latter's death, the family became extinct.

During World War II, the Waffen SS's 10th Panzer Division was given the honorific title Frundsberg.

<doc id="10898" title="Fugue state" nonfiltered="44" processed="43" dbindex="1500043">
For the New York City-based publisher, see Fugue State Press.;

In the field of psychology, a fugue state is usually defined by the term dissociative fugue. It is etiologically related to dissociative amnesia (which in popular culture is usually simply called amnesia, the state where someone completely forgets who they are).  

A fugue state is therefore similar in nature to the concept of dissociative identity disorder (DID) (formerly called multiple-personality disorder) although DID is widely understood to have its conception in a long-term life event (such as a traumatic childhood), where sufficient time is given for alternate personality representations to form and take hold.  Sudden neurological damage would thus seem to fit more closely the onset of a fugue state.

As the person experiencing a fugue state may have recently suffered an amnesic onset - perhaps a head trauma, or the reappearance of an event or person representing an earlier life trauma - the emergence of a "new" personality seems to be for some, a logical apprehension of the situation.

Therefore, the terminology fugue state may carry a slight linguistic distinction from dissociative fugue, the former implying a greater degree of motion.  For the purposes of this article then, a fugue state would occur while one is acting out a dissociative fugue.

The DSM-IV defines Dissociative Fugue as:
sudden, unexpected travel away from home or one's customary place of work, with inability to recall one's past,
confusion about personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity, or;
significant distress or impairment.

The Merck Manual  defines Dissociative Fugue as:

 One or more episodes of amnesia in which the inability to recall some or all of one's past and either the loss of one's identity or the formation of a new identity occur with sudden, unexpected, purposeful travel away from home.

In support of this definition, the Merck Manual  further defines Dissociative amnesia as:

 An inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.

Prevalence and onset.
It has been estimated that approximately 0.2 percent of the population experiences dissociative fugue, although prevalence increases significantly following a stressful life event, such as wartime experience or some other disaster.  Other life stressors may trigger a fugue state, such as financial difficulties, personal problems or legal issues.  Unlike a dissociative identity disorder, a fugue is usually considered to be a malingering disorder, resolving to remove the experiencer from responsibility for their actions, or from situations imposed upon them by others. Similar to dissociative amnesia, the fugue state usually affects personal memories from the past, rather than encyclopedic or abstract knowledge.  A fugue state therefore does not imply any overt seeming or "crazy" behaviour.

Treatment and prognosis.
Most fugues last for hours or days and disappear on their own. Dissociative fugue is treated much the same as dissociative amnesia, and treatment may include the use of hypnosis or drug-facilitated interviews.  Most people who suffer dissociative fugues regain most or all of their prior memories; however, efforts to restore memories of the fugue period usually are unsuccessful.

The goal of treatment is to help the person come to terms with the stress or trauma that triggered the fugue. Treatment also aims to develop new coping methods to prevent further fugue episodes. The best treatment approach depends on the individual and the severity of his or her symptoms, but most likely will include some combination of the following treatment methods:

Psychotherapy   Psychotherapy, a type of counseling, is the main treatment for dissociative disorders. This treatment uses techniques designed to encourage communication of conflicts and increase insight into problems. ;
Cognitive therapy   This type of therapy focuses on changing dysfunctional thinking patterns and resulting feelings and behaviors. ;
Medication   There is no medication to treat the dissociative disorders themselves. However, a person with a dissociative disorder who also suffers from depression or anxiety might benefit from treatment with a medication such as an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medicine. ;
Family therapy   This helps to teach the family about the disorder and its causes, as well as to help family members recognize symptoms of a recurrence. ;
Creative therapies (art therapy, music therapy)   These therapies allow the patient to explore and express his or her thoughts and feelings in a safe and creative way. ;
Clinical hypnosis   This is a treatment method that uses intense relaxation, concentration and focused attention to achieve an altered state of consciousness (awareness), allowing people to explore thoughts, feelings and memories they might have hidden from their conscious minds. The use of hypnosis for treating dissociative disorders is controversial due to the risk of creating false memories.

Cases.

Joe Bieger   On 5 October 2006 Joe Bieger wandered the streets of Dallas, Texas, for 25 days.;
Doug Bruce   The documentary Unknown White Male (2005) deals with subject Doug Bruce's fugue state during his retrograde amnesia.;
Agatha Christie   Mystery writer Agatha Christie went missing for eleven days in 1926. Her car was found abandoned on the road with some belongings strewn about the area. She was later found living in a hotel under a different name. In a 2006 biography, author Andrew Norman proffered the theory that the mysterious disappearance of Christie was attributable to a fugue state.
David Fitzpatrick   David Fitzpatrick, a 25-year-old British man, suffered a psychogenic fugue on 4 December 2005 which wiped his entire memory clean, leaving him with no identity. The television documentary Extraordinary People: The Man with No Past followed Fitzpatrick as he tried to recover the life he had before, and discovered he had a dark past   heavy drinking, unemployment, sponging off family and friends, and failed relationships (one of which resulted in the birth of a daughter, now aged six years)   as well as a unique opportunity to start all over again.

<doc id="2170885" title="Torreya" nonfiltered="46" processed="45" dbindex="1500045">


Torreya is a genus of conifers comprising of five or six species, treated in either the Cephalotaxaceae, or in the Taxaceae when that family is considered in a broad sense. Four are native to eastern Asia, the other two native to North America. They are small to medium sized evergreen trees reaching 5-20 m, rarely 25 m, tall.

The leaves are spirally arranged on the shoots, but twisted at the base to lie in two flat ranks; they are linear, 2-8 cm long and 3-4 mm broad, hard in texture, with a sharp spine tip.

Torreya can be either monoecious or dioecious; when monoecious, the male and female cones are often on different branches. The male (pollen) cones are 5-8 mm long, grouped in lines along the underside of a shoot. The female (seed) cones are single or grouped 2-8 together on a short stem; minute at first, they mature in about 18 months to a drupe-like structure with the single large nut-like seed 2-4 cm long surrounded by a fleshy covering, green to purple at full maturity. In some species, notably the Japanese Torreya nucifera (Kaya), the seed is edible. Natural dispersal is thought to be aided by squirrels which bury the seeds for a winter food source; any seeds left uneaten are then able to germinate.

The genus is named after the American botanist John Torrey.

Torreya californica (California Torreya) is endemic in California. It is the largest species, reaching 25 m tall.

Torreya taxifolia (Florida Torreya) has a restricted habitat within Torreya State Park, along the east bank of the Apalachicola River in the Florida Panhandle and immediate adjacent southernmost Georgia. It is an endangered species, which has suffered a major decline in numbers due to fungal disease (possibly Phytophthora). Post-glacial global warming has also been implicated in this species' decline; however, it is sold by at least one Florida nursery in Hudson, well south of its native range. It is best adapted to the cooler, moister climate found in this area during the last ice age but, due to poor dispersal abilities, has not been able to colonise further north in the post-glacial warming. Cultivated specimens are however growing very well in cooler climates in the Appalachian Mountains, in northern Georgia and at the Biltmore Gardens in Asheville, North Carolina where it is regenerating naturally. It has been proposed that the best course to save the species from extinction is to plant groves of it in these areas.

Assisted Migration for Torreya taxifolia (from Florida to S. Appalachians).

Torreya Guardians is a volunteer group of citizen-naturalists, botanists, ecologists, and landowners that has formed with the mission of finding and implementing ways outside the jurisdiction of The Endangered Species Act to use private seed stock to establish groves of Torreya taxifolia trees in the southern Appalachians and points north, such that viable seeds will then be available for rewilding this tree onto private lands far enough north and at high enough elevations to resist the diseases already brought about by global warming in its endemic habitat in Florida.  The idea is that Torreya taxifolia for some reason was unable to migrate on its own back north from its "ice age pocket refuge" in northern Florida, and that "assisted migration" will thus help this species return to its traditional interglacial range in the Appalachian Mountains.  The January 2007 issue of Conservation Magazine depicted Torreya taxifolia as the lead candidate for assisted migration owing to global warming.

A superocean is a global ocean that surrounds a global supercontinent.  It is less commonly defined as any ocean larger than the current Pacific Ocean.  Named global superoceans include Mirovia, which surrounded the supercontinent Rodinia, and Panthalassa, which surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea.  Pannotia and Columbia, along with landmasses before Columbia (such as Ur), were also surrounded by superoceans.

As surface water moves unobstructed east to west in superoceans, it tends to warm from the exposure to sunlight so that the western edge of the ocean is warmer than the eastern.  Additionally, seasonal changes in temperature, which would have been significantly more rapid inland, probably caused powerful monsoons.  In general, however, the mechanics of superoceans are not well understood.

<doc id="2137370" title="A601(M) motorway" nonfiltered="49" processed="48" dbindex="1500048">



The A601(M) is a motorway in Lancashire, England.  It is 1.1 miles (1.7km) long and meets  the M6 at Junction 35. It is dual carrigeway to the west of the M6 and single carrigeway to the east where it terminates at a Give Way sign on a B road.

History.
The section between the M6 and Junction 35A was originally opened in 1960 as part of the Lancaster Bypass.  This was a 2 lane motorway. In 1970 the M6 was extended north and a short spur was left to the A6.  The terminal roundabout was given the junction number 35A.  Plans existed to extend this as part of an Arnside link road that would have connected the Furness Peninsula with the M6. This was scrapped for environmental reasons, but parts of it exist today along the A590.

In 1987  a link was constructed with the B6254 to remove traffic for Over Kellet Quarries and Kirkby Lonsdale passing through Carnforth.  The road was then renumbered as the A601(M). A junction number was not given to this terminus.

Junctions.


Trivia.
 One of two motorways to have a single carriageway section; the M58 is the other. The A6144(M) was another, but no longer has motorway status.
 One of three different motorways that have a roundabout in the middle, without a flyover or underpass; the others being the M271 and the A627(M).
The A601(M) is not the A601 under motorway restrictions, as is the usual explanation for such a classification in the UK. The A601 itself is the Derby inner ring road - over 100 miles (160 km) away.

<doc id="5415" title="Crokinole" nonfiltered="50" processed="49" dbindex="1500049">



Crokinole (pronounced croak-i-knoll, ) is an action board game similar to carrom, shove ha'penny or squails with elements of shuffleboard and curling reduced to table-top size. Players take turns shooting 12 checker-like pieces across the board surface. The pieces have concave faces to reduce sliding friction and often have a central hole. They may also be ring shaped and formed of wood or plastic. 

Board dimensions vary with a playing surface typically of polished wood or laminate approximately 27 inches in diameter. The arrangement is 3 concentric rings worth 5, 10, and 15 points as you move in from the outside. There is a shallow 20 point hole at the center. The inner 15 point ring is guarded with 8 small bumpers or posts. The outer ring of the board is divided into four quadrants. The outer edge of the board is raised a bit to keep errant shots from flying out, with a gutter between the playing surface and the edge to collect discarded pieces.  Crokinole boards are typically octagonal or round in shape.

Game play.
Players flick their pieces from the outer edge of their quadrant. A common variant uses small cue sticks, like those that would be used for Billiards. Players must shoot and hit or touch an enemy piece if present, or the piece is 'fouled' and removed from the board. Many (but not all) rules also state that if no opposing pieces are on the board, you must shoot for and land completely in the guarded center 15-point ring. This is often called the 'no hiding' rule, since it prevents players from placing their first shots where their opponent must traverse completely though the guarded centre ring to hit them and avoid fouling. Scoring occurs after all pieces have been played and is differential: opposing pieces in the same ring cancel. Play continues until a predetermined score is reached. 

The prairie province rules never uses cue sticks, counts the centre hole as 20, and usually plays in teams of two, starting play rotating to each of the 4 players in turn. 

Origins and popularity.
The earliest known crokinole board was made by craftsman, Eckhardt Wettlaufer in 1876 in Perth County, Ontario, Canada. Several other home-made boards of southwestern Ontario origin, and dating from the 1870s have been discovered within the past 10 years. Crokinole is often believed to be of Mennonite or Amish origins, but there is no factual data to support such a claim. The reason for this misconception may be due to its popularity in Mennonite and Amish sects. The game was viewed as a rather innocuous pastime - unlike the perception that diversions such as card playing or dancing were 'works of the Devil' as held by many 19th century Protestant groups. The oldest roots of crokinole from the 1860s suggest the British and South Asian games are the most likely antecedents of what became crokinole.

The name "Crokinole" derives from the  word "croquinole", which means "cookie" (British English, "biscuit") in Quebec French.

Tournaments.
A world championship tournament has been held annually since 1999 in Tavistock, Ontario, Canada. In 2006, there were 126 competitors in the Adult Singles division, and the winner was Jason Beierling of Varna, Ontario, Canada.  The WCC also awards a prize for the top 20's shooter in the qualifying round, as well as separate categories juniors, intermediates and recreational players, and for doubles, cue singles, cue doubles.

Notes.
In 2006, a documentary movie called "Crokinole" was released.  The "world premiere" occurred at the Princess Cinema in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada in the Spring of 2006.   The movie follows some of the competitors of the 2004 World Crokinole Championship as they prepare for the event.

The flip side of Carrom-brand game boards is a Crokinole board.

Camarina is an ancient city of Sicily, situated on the south coast, about 17 miles South East of Gela (Terranova). It was founded by Syracuse in 599 B.C., but destroyed by the mother city in 552. 

The Geloans, however, founded it anew in 461 B.C. It seems to have been in general hostile to Syracuse, but, though an ally of Athens in 427, it gave some slight help to Syracuse in 415-413 B.C. It was destroyed by the Carthaginians in 405 B.C., restored by Timoleon in 339 B.C. after its abandonment by Dionysiuss order, but in 258 B.C. fell into the hands of the Romans. 

Its complete destruction dates from A.D. 853. The site of the ancient city is among rapidly shifting sandhills, and the lack of stone in the neighborhood has led to its buildings being used as a quarry even by the inhabitants of Terranova, so that nothing is now visible above ground but a small part of the wall of the temple of Athena and a few foundations of houses; portions of the city wall have been traced by excavation, and the necropolis has been carefully explored.

James Clow (born 1790 in Scotland   1861) was a reverend minister, and the first white settler in the area which now consists of the outer-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. 

Clow joined the ministry of the Presbyterian Church in 1813. In 1815 he was appointed as a chaplain for the East India Company. He returned to Scotland in 1833 and then headed to Hobart, Australia, in 1837. On Christmas Day that year, he conducted the first Church of Scotland service in the colony on Australia. By the following year he had settled in Melbourne and purchased two acres of land on Swanston Street. 

In August 1838 he leased the Corhanwarrabul Run, an area which covered approximately 36 square miles, on which he built a homestead called 'Tirhartruan', and an out-station called 'Glen Fern'. He sold the lease to John Wood Beilby in 1850. Tirhartruan was located on the north side of Wellington Road, just east of Dandenong Creek, and was the subject of an archaeological dig in the 1970s. The electoral ward of Tirhartruan in the City of Knox is named after Clow's homestead.

A full stop or period (sometimes stop, full point or dot), is the punctuation mark commonly placed at the end of several different types of sentences in English and several other languages. A full stop consists of a small dot placed at the end of a line of text, such as at the end of this sentence. 

The term full stop is rarely used by speakers in the United States and Canada. If it is used in Canada, it may be generally differentiated from period in contexts where both might be used: a full stop is specifically a delimiting piece of punctuation that represents the end of a sentence. When a distinction is made, a period is then any appropriately sized and placed dot in English language text, including use in abbreviations (such as U.K.) and at the ends of sentences, but excluding certain special uses of dots at the bottom of a line of text, such as ellipses.

The term STOP was used in telegrams in place of the period in telegrams. The end of a sentence would be marked by STOP, as using FULL STOP was costly. The end of the entire telegram would be noted by FULL STOP.

The word "period", although recognised as an Americanism, is also used vernacularly throughout the English-speaking world to terminate a phrase or thought with finality and emphasis, as in "This is your last chance, period." The term full stop is also used in this sense in many parts of the world.

 Abbreviations .

The period is also used after abbreviations, such as Mrs. & Ms. If the abbreviation is ending a declaratory sentence an additional full stop is not needed (e.g. My name is Phil Simpson Jr.), but in the case of an interrogative or exclamatory sentence a question or exclamation mark is needed. In British English, "Dr" and "Mr" do not need a period, as they include both the first and last letter of the abbreviated word; but in American English, these are written "Dr." and "Mr." In this use, the period is also occasionally known as the suspension mark.

 Mathematical usage .

The same glyph has two separate uses with regard to numbers, the one applied being determined by the country it is used in: as a decimal separator and in presenting large numbers in a more readable form. In most English-speaking countries, the full stop has the former usage while a comma or a space is used for the latter:
"1,000,000" (One million);
 "1,000.000" (One thousand);
In much of Europe, however, a comma is used as a decimal separator, while a full stop or a space is used for the presentation of large numbers.

In countries that use the comma as a decimal separator, the full stop is sometimes found as a multiplication sign, for example: 5,2 . 2 = 10,4. This usage is impossible in countries that use the period as a decimal separator, hence the use of the interpunct: 5.2 · 2 = 10.4

 Differences in British English and American English .

In British English, when a quotation mark appears at the end of a sentence the full stop is usually placed after it. The matter is partly determined by the length of the enclosed material: the longer it is, more acceptable it is that the full stop should come first. Any full sentence enclosed within quotation marks will have its full stop before the final quotation mark.

In American English the full stop normally comes before the quotation mark. (This applies to commas and some other punctuation, also.)

Examples of typical usage:

   You say "tomAYto", I say "tomAHto".
  I say "tomAYto," you say "tomAHto.";

An exception to the American rule occurs when the placing of the full stop inside the quote would lead to ambiguity, for example in describing commands to be typed into a computer:

 At the prompt type "ls -lad".

In the case above, giving the instruction:

 At the prompt type "ls -lad." ;

would result in an error, since the full stop has special significance in instructions typed into a computer.

 Spacing after full stop .

In typewritten texts and other documents printed in fixed-width fonts, there is a convention among lay writers that two spaces are placed after the full stop (along with the other sentence enders: question mark and exclamation mark), as opposed to the single space used after other punctuation symbols.  This is sometimes termed "French spacing".

In modern English-language typographical usage, debate has arisen concerning the proper number of trailing spaces after a full stop (or exclamation mark, or question mark) to separate sentences within a paragraph. Whereas two spaces are still regarded by many outside the publishing industry to be the better usage for monospace typefaces, the awkwardness that most word-processing applications have in representing correctly the 1.5 spaces that had previously become standard for typographically proportional (non-monospace) fonts has led to some confusion about how to render the space between sentences using only word-processing tools.

Many descriptivists (i.e. people who describe how language is used in practice) support the notion that a single space after a full stop should be considered standard because it has been the norm in mainstream publishing for many decades. This also includes the MLA, APA, and the CMS. Many prescriptivists (i.e. people who make recommendations for rules of language use), meanwhile, adhere to the earlier use of two spaces on typewriters to make the separation of sentences more salient than separation of elements within sentences. Some, however, accept that in modern word-processing the single space is better because two spaces may stretch inordinately when full justification is applied. Additionally, many computer typefaces are designed proportionately to alleviate the need for the double space (the opposition would of course reply that this does nothing to satisfy the aforementioned saliency issue). Most modern typesetters, designers, and desktop publishers use only one space after a period, as do most mainstream publishers of books and journals.

With the advent of standardized HTML for rendering webpages, the broader distinction between full stop spacing and internal spacing in a sentence has become largely moot on the World Wide Web. Standardized HTML treats additional whitespace after the first space as immaterial (siding unquestioningly with the one-spacers), and ignores it when rendering the page. A common workaround for this is the use of &nbsp; (Non-breaking space) to represent extra spaces, and is done automatically by some WYSIWYG editors.

A strong argument for having two spaces after a full stop arises from accessibility, or universal design.  It is often reported that people with dyslexia prefer double spacing after a full stop.  See justification (typesetting) for further discussion.

 Asian full stop .

In some Asian languages, notably Chinese and Japanese, a small circle is used instead of a solid dot: " " (U+3002 "Ideographic Full Stop"). Unlike the Western full stop, this is often used to separate consecutive sentences, rather than to finish every sentence; it is frequently left out where a sentence stands alone, or where text is terminated by a quotation mark instead.

In these languages, the partition sign  "·" (    ji ngéhào) is often used to separate the transliteration of a foreign given name from the family name: for example, William Shakespeare is represented in Chinese as         (Weilian·Shashibiya), and in Japanese as               (Uiriamu·Sheikusupia), with a partition sign inserted between the characters for "William" and those of "Shakespeare".

The Chinese partition sign is also used to separate book title and chapter title when they are mentioned consecutively (with book title first, then chapter).

 Computing use .

In computing, the period is often used as a delimiter commonly called a "dot", for example in DNS lookups and file names. For example:

 www.example.com;
 document.doc;

In computer programming, the full stop corresponds to Unicode and ASCII character 46, or 0x2E.

Charles Amos Cummings (1823 1911), prominent nineteenth century American architect and architectural historian who worked primarily in the Venetian Gothic style. Cummings followed the precepts of British cultural theorist and architectural critic John Ruskin (1819 1900). Cummings help to found The Boston Society of Architects in 1867.

Biography.
Born in Boston, Cummings was educated in the Boston Public Schools. Cummings graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. Returning to Boston, Cummings joined the office of Gridley Bryant, where he met Willard T. Sears. In 1861 the two left Bryant's office to form their own architectural studio, Cummings and Sears. Cummings travelled extensively in Europe, primarily Italy. Travel, and writing about Italian architecture informed his own work, and while a part of the larger Gothic Revival syle Cummings, and his partner Sears, can not be seen as academic revivalists. They began to express a more contemporary, American architectural voice much in the way Henry Hobson Richardson did with the Romanesque vernacular. Two early projects of the firm, Brechin Hall built in 1861, and Stone Chapel built in 1867 both at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts brought positive notice, and increased commissions to the firm. The office designed the massive brick Boston Cyclorama built to exhibit a large cyclical mural The Battle of Gettysburg, today it houses the Boston Center for the Arts. In 1872 the firm designed a large Stick Style residence at 121 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston's Back Bay, and the smaller but significant Pratt House in Forest Hills, also in the Stick Style. 

Following Boston's Great Fire of 1872, the firm was enlisted in the reconstruction of many downtown buildings. A significant part of Cummings and Sears practice focused on ecclesiastical architecture, building churches throughout Massachusetts and northern New England. In 1874 Cummings was commissioned to design what is considered his masterwork, a new building for the third oldest congregation in America, Old South Church in Boston located in Boston's Copley Square. 

Cummings continued to work, almost until his own death in 1911. His last major commission was the design of the Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The monumnet took the form of a 220' tower, built as an Italian campanile.The monument was dedicated in 1908 by Theodore Roosevelt. 

Cummings collected a vast number of mediaeval sculptures, and on his death bequeathed the collection to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, also funding the Charles Amos Cummings Bequest Fund for the collection and care of ancient sculpture for the museum.

Publishing.
Cummings wrote several treatises on Italian architecture. In 1901 he published  his largest work A history of architecture in Italy from the time of Constantine to the dawn of the renaissance with over 500 illustrations. In the same year, with Russell Sturgis, he published the Dictionary of Architecture and Building, which became a standard architectural text book.

<doc id="1971690" title="Recreation Park (Pittsburgh)" nonfiltered="60" processed="59" dbindex="1500060">
Recreation Park was a baseball park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where from 1884 to 1890 it served as the home field for the fledgling professional baseball team later known as the Pittsburgh Pirates.  It also hosted early football games of the Western University of Pennsylvania, now known as the University of Pittsburgh from 1889 to 1924.

The ballpark site was a five-sided property bounded by Grant (later Galveston) Avenue, North Avenue, Allegheny Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and the Fort Wayne railroad tracks in Allegheny City, which since 1907 is a part of the city of Pittsburgh.

The site had first been used for professional baseball in 1876, by the Allegheny entry in the International Association, a minor league that paralleled the National League in the latter's inaugural year.

The Allegheny club of the American Association transferred here from the first incarnation of Exposition Park, starting in 1884 (the park was also home to the short-lived Pittsburgh Stogies. Flooding had been a problem at Expo, and this new park was sufficiently uphill to stay dry.

The club joined the National League in 1887 and continued to play here through 1890, after which they moved back to a refurbished Expo Park. In 1890 the club also changed its name from "Allegheny" to "Pittsburg", in the spelling of the day. During the 1890-1891 off-season they were tagged as "Pirates" after allegedly "pirating" second baseman Louis Bierbauer away from the Philadelphia Athletics American Association team during the Players' League settlement process. The nickname stuck and eventually became official.

After the Pirates abandoned Recreation Park, it was used for other sports such as football, and also bicycle racing which was a national craze during the 1890s. Part of the site eventually became the home of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club.

Superman 64 was released by Titus Software on May 31, 1999 on the Nintendo 64. The game is based on . Much like Castlevania 64, the game is not actually titled "Superman 64" on its box, cartridge, or title screen. The "64" was added by the gaming community to avoid confusion with other Superman media. This game was also released for PlayStation but copies of the PlayStation version are rare.

Story.
Lex Luthor has created a virtual version of Metropolis and has succeeded in trapping Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Professor Emil Hamilton within it. Superman must enter the virtual world to fly through countless hoops, save his friends, and stop Lex Luthor.

Gameplay.
In most levels, Superman is forced to fly through a series of rings within a time limit (Unless the player goes on easy mode the rings dissapear but the timer stays). The "virtual metropolis" is filled with Kryptonite fog, supposedly to slow him down.  Superman has several other powers, but they are rarely used.

Reception.
The game was received very poorly by gaming audiences and is considered by many to be one of the worst video games ever made. It was rated as the 7th worst game of all-time in a list created by Seanbaby in Electronic Gaming Monthly. It also ranked 2nd on G4's Filter in its top 10 worst games of all-time. Nintendo Power magazine (volume 196) rated it as the worst game of all-time on a Nintendo system. On MTV's Gamer's 2.0, it was rated the #1 worst game of all time. The game also topped GameSpy's list of the ten worst comic book based video games of all time, as compiled by journalist David Chapman.

Game reviewers focused their complaints on unresponsive controls and monotonous gameplay.  Critics found little redeeming value in the game.

Pompeo Girolamo Batoni or Battoni (25 January, 1708 - 4 February, 1787) was a highly influential Italian painter whose style incorporated elements of the French Rococo, Bolognese classicism and nascent Neoclassicism.

Biography.
He was born in Lucca and died in Rome. Batoni was born the son of a goldsmith, Paolino Battoni. He moved to Rome in 1727 or 1728, and apprenticed with Sebastiano Conca and/or Francesco Imperiale (1679-1740). 

By the early 1740s, however, he started to receive independent commissions. In 1741, he was inducted into the Accademia di San Luca. His celebrated painting, The Ecstasy of Saint Catherine of Siena (1743)  illustrates his academic refinement of the late-Baroque style. Another masterpiece, his Fall of Simon Magus was painted initially for the St Peter's Basilica.

Batoni became a highly-fashionable painter in the Rome, particularly after his rival, the proto-neoclassicist Anton Raphael Mengs, departed for Spain in 1761. Batoni befriended Winckelmann and, like him, aimed in his painting to the the restrained classicism of painters from earlier centuries, such asRaphael and Poussin, rather to the work of the Venetian artists then in vogue. 

He was greatly in demand for portraits, particularly by the British traveling through Rome , who took pleasure in commissioning standing portraits set in the milieu of antiquities, ruins, and works of art. Such "Grand Tourist" portraits by Batoni came to proliferate in the British private collections, thus ensuring the genre's popularity in the United Kingdom, where Sir Joshua Reynolds would become its leading practitioner. In 1769, the double portrait of Joseph II and Leopold II won an Austrian nobility for Batoni. He also portrayed Pope Pius VI. According to a rumor, he bequeathed his palette and brushes to Jacques-Louis David.

He was married twice, to Caterina Setti (d. 1742) in 1729, and then to Lucia Fattori in 1747, and had twelve children; three of his sons assisted in his studio. From 1759 Batoni lived in a large house on the Via Bocca di Leone in Rome, which included a studio as well as exhibition rooms and a drawing academy.

<doc id="5148640" title="Tuoba Huang" nonfiltered="66" processed="65" dbindex="1500066">
Tuoba Huang (   ) (428-451), formally Crown Prince Jingmu (    ) (literally "the decisive and solemn crown prince"), later further formally honored as Emperor Jingmu (    ) with the temple name Gongzong (  ) by his son Emperor Wencheng, was a crown prince of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei.  He was the oldest son of Emperor Taiwu, and was created crown prince in 432 at the age of four, and as he grew older, Emperor Taiwu transferred more and more authority to him.  However, in 451, he incurred the wrath of his father due to false accusations of the eunuch Zong Ai, and many of his associates were put to death.  He himself grew ill in fear, and died that year.

 Early life .
Tuoba Huang was born in 428, as Emperor Taiwu's oldest son.  His mother's name was render as Consort He (   ), but since both the Helan (  ) and Helai (  ) clans later changed their names to He (during the reign of Tuoba Huang's great-grandson Emperor Xiaowen), it is unclear whether her name was Helan or Helai.  She died the year that she gave birth to him, suggesting that she might have died in childbirth, but there is no conclusive evidence that it happened.

In 432, Emperor Taiwu created Tuoba Huang crown prince, at the same time that he created one of his consorts, Consort Helian, empress.  He became a highly ranked official in his father's administration that same year, although, at age four, the position was likely nominal.  In 433, Emperor Taiwu tried to negotiate a marriage between Crown Prince Huang and one of the daughters of Emperor Wen of Liu Song, but Emperor Wen, while not immediately rejecting the proposal, did not agree either.

In 439, when Emperor Taiwu was on a campaign to conquer Northern Liang, he had Crown Prince Huang assume imperial authority at the capital Pingcheng (  , in modern Datong, Shanxi), assisted by the high-ranking official Qiumuling Shou (    ), to guard against a Rouran attack.  However, Qiumuling, not believing that Rouran would actually attack, took little actual precautions, and when Rouran's Chilian Khan Yujiulü Wuti attacked, Pingcheng was caught nearly defenseless.  Qiumuling wanted to escort Crown Prince Huang to the hills south of Pingcheng and take up defense position there, but at the opposition of Emperor Taiwu's wet nurse Empress Dowager Dou, Crown Prince Huang remained in Pingcheng, and when Northern Wei forces subsequently defeated Rouran forces, Yujiulü Wuti was forced to withdraw.  (By this point, although he was only 11, Crown Prince Huang was apparently already participating in major military and policy decisions, as he had opposed his father's Northern Liang campaign, but was overruled by his father, who trusted Cui Hao's advice that Northern Liang was easily defeatable.)

By 442, Crown Prince Huang appeared to be already a devout Buddhist, and when his father, at the suggestion of Cui and the Taoist monk Kou Qianzhi, built the very high and difficult-to-construct Jinglun Palace (   ), he tried to oppose on account of cost, but Emperor Taiwu did not agree.

In 443, Crown Prince Huang accompanied his father on a campaign against Rouran, and when theysuddenly encountered Yujiulü Wuti, Crown Prince Huang advised an immediate attack, but Emperor Taiwu hesitated, allowing Yujiulü Wuti to escape.  From that point on, Emperor Taiwu began to listen to Crown Prince Huang's advice in earnest, and in winter 443, he authorized Crown Prince Huang to carry out all imperial duties except the most important ones, under assistance from Qiumuling, Cui, Zhang Li (  ), and Tuxi Bi (   ).  Crown Prince Huang soon instituted a policy to encourage farming -- by mandatorily requiring those who had extra cattle to loan them to those without, to be animals of burden, with the lease being paid for by those without cattle by tilling the grounds of the cattle owners, increasing the efficiency of the farmlands greatly.

 After Emperor Taiwu's partial transfer of authority .
In 446, while Emperor Taiwu was attacking the Xiongnu rebel Gai Wu (  ), he found a large number of weapons in Buddhist temples in Chang'an.  Believing that the monks were aligned with Gai, he slaughtered the monks in Chang'an.  Cui Hao used this opportunity to encourage Emperor Taiwu to slaughter all monks throughout the empire and destroy the temples, statues, and sutras, and notwithstanding Kou Qianzhi's opposition, Emperor Taiwu proceeded to slaughter the monks in Chang'an, destroy the statues, and burn the sutras. He then issued an empire-wide prohibition of Buddhism. Crown Prince Huang, however, used delaying tactics in promulgating the edict, allowing Buddhists to flee or hide, but it was said that not a single Buddhist temple remained standing in Northern Wei. This was the first of the Three Disasters of Wu.

By 450, Crown Prince Huang appeared to be in direct conflict with Cui over administration of the state.  When Cui recommended a number of men to be commandery governors, Crown Prince Huang objected strenously, and yet the men were commissioned over his objection at Cui's insistence.  It appeared that Crown Prince Huang had a hand when, later in 450, Cui was put to death with his entire clan, on account of having defamed imperial ancestors, as Crown Prince Huang argued hard to spare one of Cui's staff members, Gao Yun, and during that process, Gao gave some statements regarding Cui that could be viewed either as exculpatory or inculpatory.

In fall of 450, when Liu Song's Emperor Wen sent his general Wang Xuanmo (   ) to attack Huatai (  , in modern Anyang, Henan), Emperor Taiwu personally led an army to relieve Huatai, and subsequently, after defeating Wang, advanced deeply into Liu Song territory, all the way to the Yangtze River.  During Emperor Taiwu's campaign against Liu Song, pursuant to his instructions, Crown Prince Huang was on the northern border, defending against a potential Rouran attack.

 Death and aftermaths .
Crown Prince Huang was described to be high observant, but trusting of his associates and also spending much effort on managing orchards and farms, to earn money from them.  Gao Yun tried to advise him against engaging in commercial ventures and in overly delegating authorities, but he did not listen.  Rather, in 451, he became embroiled in a conflict with the eunuch Zong Ai, whose corruption he had found out and whom he disliked immensely.  Zong, apprehensive that Crown Prince Huang's trusted associates Chouni Daosheng (    ) and Ren Pingcheng (   ) would accuse him of crimes, acted preemptorily and accused Chouni and Ren of crimes.  In anger, Emperor Taiwu executed Chouni and Ren, and many other associates of Crown Prince Huang were entangled in the case and executed as well.  In fear, Crown Prince Huang became ill and died.

Emperor Taiwu soon became aware that Crown Prince Huang was not involved in any crimes, and he regretted his actions greatly.  Around the new year 451, he created Crown Prince Huang's oldest son Tuoba Jun the Prince of Gaoyang, but soon removed that title on the account that the crown prince's oldest son should not be a mere imperial prince -- a strong sign that he was intending to create Tuoba Jun crown prince ventually.  Zong, in fear that Emperor Taiwu would punish him, assassinated Emperor Taiwu in spring 452, and then seized power, killing a number of officials and Crown Prince Huang's younger brother Tuoba Han (   ) the Prince of Dongping, while making another younger brother of Crown Prince Huang's, Tuoba Yu the Prince of Nan'an emperor.  Zong controlled the imperial regime, and when Tuoba Yu tried to assert his own power in fall 452, Zong assassinated him as well.  Officials led by Yuan He, Baba Kehou (    ), Dugu Ni (   ), and Buliugu Li rose against Zong and killed him, making Tuoba Jun emperor, and Tuoba Jun, after he took the throne as Emperor Wencheng, posthumously honored Tuoba Huang as an emperor.

Electrohydraulic manual transmission or clutchless manual gear system is a manual transmission system that appears like an automatic transmission to the user.  The system automatically changes gear and handles the clutch during gear changes.

Mercedes-Benz have named their system Sequentronic and BMW refer to their system  SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox; as used in the M3). Toyota also has a similar transmission on the MR2 Spyder, which is known as the Sequential Manual Transmission (SMT).

Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV, or polyphenylene vinylene) is a conducting polymer of the rigid-rod polymer host family.

PPV is the only polymer of this type that has so far been successfully processed into a highly ordered crystalline thin film.

PPV is prepared by thermal processing of a precursor polymer. By careful control of the processing it is possible to influence the structure and morphology of the film.

Polyphenylene vinylene is capable of electroluminescence, leading to applications in polymer-based organic light emitting diodes. PPV was used as the emissive layer in the first polymer light-emitting diodes. Devices based on PPV emit yellow-green light, and derivatives of PPV obtained by substitution are often used when light of a different color is required.

In presence of even a small amount of oxygen, singlet oxygen is formed during operation, by energy transfer from the excited polymer molecules to oxygen molecules. These oxygen radicals then attack the structure of the polymer, leading to its degradation. Special precautions therefore have to be kept during manufacturing of PPV in order to prevent oxygen contamination.

<doc id="915633" title="Robert X. Cringely" nonfiltered="72" processed="71" dbindex="1500072">
Robert X. Cringely is the pen name of both technology journalist Mark Stephens and a string of writers for a column in InfoWorld, the weekly computer trade newspaper published by IDG.

Stephens as Cringely.

Stephens was the third author to contribute to Infoworld under the Cringely pseudonym, the first two being Rory J. O'Connor and then Laurie Flynn.  During his lengthy tenure (1987-1995), the character of Cringely changed dramatically (morphing from a private eye type to a slick, womanizing tech insider), and became an increasingly popular tech pundit after authoring the book Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition and Still Can't Get a Date (1992, ISBN 0-88730-855-4). 

After a financial disagreement in 1995, Stephens was dismissed from Infoworld, and was promptly sued by IDG to prevent him from continuing to use the Cringely trademark.  A settlement was reached out of court that allowed him to use the name, so long as he did not contribute to competing technology magazines.  As a result, Stephens' writing as Robert X. Cringely regularly appears in publications such as  The New York Times, Newsweek, Forbes, Upside, Success, and Worth.  Stephens has also appeared as Cringely in two documentaries based on his writings: Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires and Nerds 2.0.1.

Stephens' Cringely currently writes an online column for the PBS website called I, Cringely: The Pulpit, and has launched a new internet television show NerdTV. More recently he has become a blogger for the Technology Evangelist site. InfoWorld continues to print its Robert X. Cringely feature, Notes From the Field, written by an experienced technology journalist whose identity remains a well-kept secret.

 Stanford .
Stephens earned a bachelor's degree from the College of Wooster in Ohio in 1975.
 
In 1998, it was revealed  that Stephens had falsely claimed to have received a Ph.D. from Stanford University and to have been employed as a professor there.  Stanford's administration stated that while Stephens had been a teaching assistant and had pursued course work toward a doctoral degree, he had never held a professorship nor had he been awarded the degree. Stephens then stated that while he had received a master's degree from the department of communications and completed the classes and tests required for the Ph.D., he acknowledged that he failed to complete his dissertation.  Asked about the resulting controversy, Stephens told a reporter: " new fact has now become painfully clear to me: you don't say you have the Ph.D unless you REALLY have the Ph.D."

<doc id="2060695" title="Margaret Mahler" nonfiltered="75" processed="74" dbindex="1500075">
Margaret Schoenberger Mahler, or Margit Mahler (1897 - 1985) was a Hungarian psychoanalytic child psychologist who contributed many theories to developmental psychology. She studied disrupted children and early childhood attachments between mothers. By studying the relationships between mother and child she was able to distinguish psychotic children from autistic children. She felt that autistic children are unable to utilize mothers as auxiliary egos having no interest in relating to their mother or any person. Mahler distinguished symbiotic children to be attached to their mothers. These children are inseparable from their parents, unable to do anything independently.  

A rough layout of child development in her theory would look somewhat like this:

Normal Autistic Phase - First few weeks of life. The infant is detached and self absorbed. Spends most of his/her time sleeping. Mahler later abandoned this phase, and believed it to be non-existent. The phase still appears in many books on her theories.

Normal Symbiotic Phase - Lasts until about 5 months of age. The child is now aware of his/her mother but there is not a sense of individuality. The infant and the mother are one, and there is a barrier between them and the rest of the world.

Separation-Individuation Phase - The arrival of this phase marks the end of the Normal Symbiotic Phase. Separation refers to the development of limits, the differentiation between the infant and the mother, whereas individuation refers to the development of the infant's ego , sense of identity, and cognitive abilities. All of the subphases here within proceed in  this order but overlap considerably;
Differentiation - The infant ceases to be ignorant of the differentiation between him/her and the mother. "Rupture of the shell".
Practicing - Brought about by the infant's ability to crawl and then walk freely, the infant begins to explore actively, and the infant becomes more distant from the mother;
Rapprochement - In this subphase, the infant once again becomes close to the mother.
Beginning - Motivated by a desire to share discoveries with the mother.
Crisis - Between staying with the mother, being emotionally close and being more independent and exploring.
Solution - Individual solutions are enabled by the development of language and the superego.

<doc id="744951" title="Finley Peter Dunne" nonfiltered="77" processed="76" dbindex="1500077">

Finley Peter Dunne (July 10 1867 April 24 1936) was a Chicago-based U.S. author, writer and humorist.  He wrote Mr. Dooley in Peace and War in 1898.  "Mr. Dooley" became one of the first nationally syndicated newspaper features.  Set in a South Side Chicago Irish pub, Mr. Dooley, the owner and bartender, would expound upon political and social issues of the day, using the thick verbiage and accent of an Irish immigrant.  Dunne's sly humor and political acumen won the support of President Theodore Roosevelt, a frequent target of Mr. Dooley's barbs.

Peter Finley Dunne was born in Chicago on July 10, 1867. He was educated in the Chicago public schools (graduating from high school last in his class), then began his newspaper career in Chicago as a newspaper reporter/editor for the Chicago Telegram in 1884, at age 17. He was then with the Chicago News 1884-88, Chicago Times 1888, Chicago Tribune 1889, Chicago Herald 1889, Chicago Journal 1897. Originally named Peter Dunne, to honor his mother, who had died when he was in high school, he took her family name as his middle name some time before 1886, going by PF Dunne, reversed the two names in 1888, for Finley P. Dunne, and later used simply the initials, FP Dunne. His sister, Amelia Dunne Hookway, was a prominent educator and high school principal in Chicago; the former Hookway School was named in her honor.

 Mr. Dooley .
The first Dooley articles appeared when he was chief editorial writer for the Chicago Post and for a number of years he wrote the pieces without a byline or initials. They were paid for at the rate of $10 each above his newspaper pay. In 1898, he wrote a Dooley piece that celebrated the victory of Commodore George Dewey over the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay--and this piece attracted national attention. Within a short time, weekly Dooley essays were syndicated across the country.

In 1899, under the title Mr Dooley in Peace and War, a collection of the pieces was brought out in book form, received rave reviews from the critics, and was on the best seller list for a year. Dunne, then 32, became a national literary figure.

Selections from Dooley were read at meetings of the presidential cabinet. Theodore Roosevelt was a fan, despite the fact that he was one of Dunne's favorite targets. When Roosevelt published his book, The Rough Riders, Dunne wrote a tongue-in-cheek review and the nation roared. Roosevelt wrote to Dunne: "I regret to state that my family and intimate friends are delighted with your review of my book. Now I think you owe me one; and I shall expect that when you next come east you pay me a visit. I have long wanted the chance of making your acquaintance."

The two finally met at the Republican Convention in 1900, where Roosevelt gave him a news scoop--he would accept the nomination as vice presidential candidate. In later years, Dunne was a frequent guest for dinner and weekends at the White House.

Dunne wrote more than 700 Dooley pieces. About 1/3 of them were printed in eight books, with their era of influence ending with the start of World War I. He left Chicago after Dooley became popular and lived in New York where he wrote books and articles and edited the American Magazine, Metropolitan Magazine and Collier's Weekly, and was a beloved figure in club and literary circles. He died in New York on April 24, 1936.

 Margaret Abbott .
His wife, Margaret Abbott, was the daughter of the Chicago Tribune's book reviewer, Mary Ives Abbott, a newspaper woman and novelist who associated with the prominent families of the time in Chicago-the Potter Palmers, the Chatfield-Taylors, etc. She had a sort of literary salon dedicated to encouraging young Chicago writers, among whom was Dunne. Her husband had been a merchant in Calcutta before his death. She also had a son, Sprague. Mary Ives Abbott died in 1904.

Margaret Abbott was one of the first women golfers, having begun play in 1897 as a member of the prestigious Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois. She won the first Olympic gold medal for women's golf at the second Olympiad in Paris in 1900 -- thus becoming the first American woman ever to win an Olympic gold medal. That same summer, she also won the women's golf championship of France.

On December 10, 1902, Margaret Ives Abbott was married to Dunne at her mother's home in New York. She continued to play golf while she and Dunne were raising their four children. She died in 1955, perhaps never realizing that she was America's first women's Olympic champion.

 Notes .
Dunne was a charter member of a social circle of Chicago writers who frequently lampooned and competed with their New York City colleagues in pranks and outlandish stunts.  He coined numerous political quips over the years.  He is perhaps best known today as the originator of the aphorism "politics ain't beanbag". 

Dunne was a friend of Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain), with whom he played billiards, smoked cigars and drank. He was a member of Twain's "Damned Human Race Luncheon Club".

He is sometimes erroneously credited with coining the word "southpaw" for a left-handed baseball pitcher while covering sports in Chicago in the 1880s. (for example, QPB Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins by Robert Hendrickson ). In fact, the term was in use before Dunne's birth.

As a journalist in the age of "muckraking journalism", Dunne was aware of the power of institutions, including his own.  Writing as Dooley, Dunne once wrote the following passage cautioning against the power of the newspapers themselves:

"Th newspaper does ivrything f'r us. It runs th' polis foorce an' th' banks, commands th' milishy, controls th' ligislachure, baptizes th' young, marries th' foolish, comforts th' afflicted, afflicts th' comfortable, buries th' dead an' roasts thim aftherward".;

From which, somewhat ironically, journalism took only a few lines as their own and stood these up as their raison d'etre. Specifically, "The business of a newspaper is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable".  The expression has been borrowed and altered in many ways over the years. Clare Booth Luce employed a variation of it in a memorable tribute to Eleanor Roosevelt. Several religious leaders (including one Archbishop of Canterbury) have called it the goal of religion. 

And a version showed up in a memorable line delivered by Gene Kelly in a great newspaper movie, Stanley Kramer's 1960 film,
Inherit the Wind. Kelly (E. K. Hornbeck) says, "Mr. Brady, it is the duty of a newspaper to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable".

According to an article in the November 5, 2006 edition of the New York Times, he coined the truism, often wrongly attributed to Tip O'Neill, that "all politics is local."

Please see "Lieutenant Colonel" for other countries which use this rank;

Lieutenant-Colonel is a British rank used in several Commonwealth countries superior to Major and subordinate to Colonel. The comparable naval rank is Commander and the comparable rank in many Commonwealth air forces is Wing Commander.

In the British Army and Royal Marines, as well as those Commonwealth countries which recognise Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State (except Canada), a lieutenant-colonel wears a crown above a pip. The crown has varied in the past with different monarchs; the current one being the Crown of St Edward. Most other Commonwealth countries use the same insignia, with the state emblem replacing the crown. The insignia in the Canadian Forces is three horizontal bars or rings of equal width.  This stems from the merger of the Canadian armed forces in 1968 and emulates the insignia of the equivalent naval rank of Commander. In modern British forces, a Lieutenant-Colonel usually commands a regiment (in the artillery and armoured regiments) or a Battalion in the Infantry.

<doc id="29505" title="Seppuku" nonfiltered="79" processed="78" dbindex="1500079">





Seppuku (Japanese:   , "cutting the belly") is a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment.

Seppuku is also known as hara-kiri (   , "belly-cutting") and is written with the same kanji as seppuku but in reverse order with an okurigana.  In Japanese, hara-kiri is a colloquialism, seppuku being the more formal term.  Samurai (and modern adherents of bushido) would use seppuku, whereas ordinary Japanese (who in feudal times as well as today looked askance at the practice) would use hara-kiri.  Hara-kiri is the more common term in English.

The practice of committing seppuku at the death of one's master is known as oibara (   or    ) or junshi (  ); the ritual is similar.  

 Overview .
Seppuku was a key part of bushido, the code of the samurai warriors; it was used by warriors to avoid falling into enemy hands, and to attenuate shame. Samurai could also be ordered by their daimyo (feudal lords) to commit seppuku.  Later disgraced warriors were sometimes allowed to commit seppuku rather than be executed in the normal manner. Since the main point of the act was to restore or protect one's honor as a warrior, those who did not belong to the samurai caste were never ordered or expected to commit seppuku. Samurai women could only commit the act with permission.

In his book The Samurai Way of Death, Samurai: The World of the Warrior (ch.4), Dr. Stephen Turnbull states:

Seppuku was commonly performed using a tant . It could take place with preparation and ritual in the privacy of one's home, or speedily in a quiet corner of a battlefield while one s comrades kept the enemy at bay.
In the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai s spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.

Sometimes a daimyo was called upon to perform seppuku as the basis of a peace agreement. This would weaken the defeated clan so that resistance would effectively cease. Toyotomi Hideyoshi used an enemy's suicide in this way on several occasions, the most dramatic of which effectively ended a dynasty of daimyo forever, when the H j  were defeated at Odawara in 1590. Hideyoshi insisted on the suicide of the retired daimyo H j  Ujimasa, and the exile of his son Ujinao. With one sweep of a sword, the most powerful daimyo family in eastern Japan was put to an end.

 Ritual .


In time, committing seppuku came to involve a detailed ritual. A Samurai was bathed, dressed in white robes, fed his favourite meal, and when he was finished, his instrument was placed on his plate.  Dressed ceremonially, with his sword placed in front of him and sometimes seated on special cloths, the warrior would prepare for death by writing a death poem.  With his selected attendant (kaishakunin,  his second) standing by, he would open his kimono (clothing), take up his wakizashi (short sword) or a tant  (knife) and plunge it into his abdomen, making a left-to-right cut. The kaishakunin would then perform daki-kubi, a cut in which the warrior was all but decapitated (a slight band of flesh is left attaching the head to the body).  Because of the precision necessary for such a maneuver, the second was often a skilled swordsman.  The principal agreed in advance when the kaishaku made his cut, usually as soon as the dagger was plunged into the abdomen.

This elaborate ritual evolved after seppuku had ceased being mainly a battlefield or wartime practice and become a para judicial institution (see next section).

The second was usually, but not always, a friend. If a defeated warrior had fought honorably and well, an opponent who wanted to salute his bravery would volunteer to act as his second.

In the Hagakure, Yamamoto Tsunetomo wrote:

From ages past it has been considered ill-omened by samurai to be requested as kaishaku. The reason for this is that one gains no fame even if the job is well done. And if by chance one should blunder, it becomes a lifetime disgrace.
In the practice of past times, there were instances when the head flew off. It was said that it was best to cut leaving a little skin remaining so that it did not fly off in the direction of the verifying officials. However, at present it is best to cut clean through.

Some samurai chose to perform a considerably more taxing form of seppuku known as j monji-giri (     , lit. "cross-shaped cut"), in which there is no kaishakunin to put a quick end to the samurai's suffering. It involves a second and more painful vertical cut across the belly. A samurai performing jumonji-giri was expected to bear his suffering quietly until perishing from loss of blood, passing away with his hands over his face.

Seppuku as capital punishment.
While the voluntary seppuku described above is the best known form and has been widely admired and idealized, in practice the most common form of seppuku was obligatory seppuku, used as a form of capital punishment for disgraced samurai, especially for those who committed a serious offense such as unprovoked murder, robbery, corruption, or treason. The samurai were generally told of their offense in full and given a set time to commit seppuku, usually before sunset on a given day. If the sentenced was uncooperative, it was not unheard of for them to be restrained, or for the actual execution to be carried out by decapitation while retaining only the trappings of seppuku; even the short sword laid out in front of the victim could be replaced with a fan.  Unlike voluntary seppuku, seppuku carried out as capital punishment did not necessarily absolve the victim's family of the crime.  Depending on the severity of the crime, half or all of the deceased's property could be confiscated, and the family stripped of rank.

 The Western experience .

The first recorded time a Westerner saw formal seppuku was the "Sakai Incident" of 1868. On February 15, twenty French sailors of the Dupleix entered a Japanese town called Sakai without official permission. Their presence caused panic among the residents. Security forces were dispatched to turn the sailors back to their ship, but a fight broke out and 11 sailors were shot dead. Upon the protest of the French representative, compensation of 15,000 yen was paid and those responsible were sentenced to death. The French captain was present to observe the execution. As each samurai committed ritual disembowelment, the gruesome nature of the act shocked the captain, and he requested a pardon, due to which nine of the samurai were spared.  This incident was dramatized in a famous short story, Sakai Jiken, by Mori Ogai.

In the 1860s, The British Ambassador to Japan, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford (Lord Redesdale) lived within sight of Sengaku-ji where the Forty-seven Ronin are buried.  In his book Tales of Old Japan, he describes a man who had come to the graves to kill himself:

I will add one anecdote to show the sanctity which is attached to the graves of the Forty-seven. In the month of September 1868, a certain man came to pray before the grave of Oishi Chikara. Having finished his prayers, he deliberately performed hara-kiri, and, the belly wound not being mortal, dispatched himself by cutting his throat. Upon his person were found papers setting forth that, being a Ronin and without means of earning a living, he had petitioned to be allowed to enter the clan of the Prince of Choshiu, which he looked upon as the noblest clan in the realm; his petition having been refused, nothing remained for him but to die, for to be a Ronin was hateful to him, and he would serve no other master than the Prince of Choshiu: what more fitting place could he find in which to put an end to his life than the graveyard of these Braves? This happened at about two hundred yards' distance from my house, and when I saw the spot an hour or two later, the ground was all bespattered with blood, and disturbed by the death-struggles of the man.

Mitford also describes his friend's eyewitness account of a Seppuku:

There are many stories on record of extraordinary heroism being displayed in the hara-kiri. The case of a young fellow, only twenty years old, of the Choshiu clan, which was told me the other day by an eye-witness, deserves mention as a marvellous instance of determination. Not content with giving himself the one necessary cut, he slashed himself thrice horizontally and twice vertically. Then he stabbed himself in the throat until the dirk protruded on the other side, with its sharp edge to the front; setting his teeth in one supreme effort, he drove the knife forward with both hands through his throat, and fell dead.

During the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa Shogun's aide committed Seppuku:

One more story and I have done. During the revolution, when the Taikun (Supreme Commander), beaten on every side, fled ignominiously to Yedo, he is said to have determined to fight no more, but to yield everything. A member of his second council went to him and said,  Sir, the only way for you now to retrieve the honour of the family of Tokugawa is to disembowel yourself; and to prove to you that I am sincere and disinterested in what I say, I am here ready to disembowel myself with you.  The Taikun flew into a great rage, saying that he would listen to no such nonsense, and left the room. His faithful retainer, to prove his honesty, retired to another part of the castle, and solemnly performed the hara-kiri.

In his book Tales of Old Japan, Mitford describes witnessing a hara-kiri :
As a corollary to the above elaborate statement of the ceremonies proper to be observed at the hara-kiri, I may here describe an instance of such an execution which I was sent officially to witness. The condemned man was Taki Zenzaburo, an officer of the Prince of Bizen, who gave the order to fire upon the foreign settlement at Hiogo in the month of February 1868, an attack to which I have alluded in the preamble to the story of the Eta Maiden and the Hatamoto. Up to that time no foreigner had witnessed such an execution, which was rather looked upon as a traveller's fable.
The ceremony, which was ordered by the Mikado himself, took place at 10:30 at night in the temple of Seifukuji, the headquarters of the Satsuma troops at Hiogo. A witness was sent from each of the foreign legations. We were seven foreigners in all.
"After another profound obeisance, Taki Zenzaburo, in a voice which betrayed just so much emotion and hesitation as might be expected from a man who is making a painful confession, but with no sign of either in his face or manner, spoke as follows:
"I, and I alone, unwarrantably gave the order to fire on the foreigners at Kobe, and again as they tried to escape. For this crime I disembowel myself, and I beg you who are present to do me the honour of witnessing the act."
Bowing once more, the speaker allowed his upper garments to slip down to his girdle, and remained naked to the waist. Carefully, according to custom, he tucked his sleeves under his knees to prevent himself from falling backwards; for a noble Japanese gentleman should die falling forwards. Deliberately, with a steady hand, he took the dirk that lay before him; he looked at it wistfully, almost affectionately; for a moment he seemed to collect his thoughts for the last time, and then stabbing himself deeply below the waist on the left-hand side, he drew the dirk slowly across to the right side, and, turning it in the wound, gave a slight cut upwards. During this sickeningly painful operation he never moved a muscle of his face. When he drew out the dirk, he leaned forward and stretched out his neck; an expression of pain for the first time crossed his face, but he uttered no sound. At that moment the kaishaku, who, still crouching by his side, had been keenly watching his every movement, sprang to his feet, poised his sword for a second in the air; there was a flash, a heavy, ugly thud, a crashing fall; with one blow the head had been severed from the body.
A dead silence followed, broken only by the hideous noise of the blood throbbing out of the inert heap before us, which but a moment before had been a brave and chivalrous man. It was horrible.
The kaishaku made a low bow, wiped his sword with a piece of rice paper which he had ready for the purpose, and retired from the raised floor; and the stained dirk was solemnly borne away, a bloody proof of the execution.
The two representatives of the Mikado then left their places, and, crossing over to where the foreign witnesses sat, called us to witness that the sentence of death upon Taki Zenzaburo had been faithfully carried out. The ceremony being at an end, we left the temple.
The ceremony, to which the place and the hour gave an additional solemnity, was characterised throughout by that extreme dignity and punctiliousness which are the distinctive marks of the proceedings of Japanese gentlemen of rank; and it is important to note this fact, because it carries with it the conviction that the dead man was indeed the officer who had committed the crime, and no substitute. While profoundly impressed by the terrible scene it was impossible at the same time not to be filled with admiration of the firm and manly bearing of the sufferer, and of the nerve with which the kaishaku performed his last duty to his master."

 Seppuku in modern Japan .

Seppuku as judicial punishment was officially abolished in 1873, shortly after the Meiji Restoration, but voluntary seppuku did not completely die out. Dozens of people are known to have committed seppuku since then, including some military men who committed suicide in 1895 as a protest against the return of a conquered territory to China; by General Nogi and his wife on the death of Emperor Meiji in 1912; and by numerous soldiers and civilians who chose to die rather than surrender at the end of World War II.  

In 1970, famed author Yukio Mishima and one of his followers committed public seppuku at the Japan Self-Defense Forces headquarters after an unsuccessful attempt to incite the armed forces to stage a coup d'état. Mishima committed seppuku in the office of General Kanetoshi Mashita.  His second, a 25-year-old named Masakatsu Morita, tried three times to ritually behead Mishima but failed; his head was finally severed by Hiroyasu Koga. Morita then attempted to commit seppuku himself. Although his own cuts were too shallow to be fatal, he gave the signal and he too was beheaded by Koga.

In 1999, Masaharu Nonaka, a 58-year-old employee of Bridgestone in Japan, slashed his belly with a sashimi knife to protest his forced retirement. He died later in the hospital. This suicide, which became widely known as 'risutora seppuku', was said to represent the difficulties in Japan following the collapse of the bubble economy.

If, notwithstanding this warning, any instance of the practice should occur, it will be deemed that the deceased lord was to blame for unreadiness. Henceforward, moreover, his son and successor will be held to be blameworthy for incompetence, as not having prevented the suicides.";

The All-Star Winners Squadron, also known as the All-Star Winners Society, was an Amalgam Comics superhero team that supposedly existed during the Golden Age. They are a combination of DC Comics' All-Star Squadron and Marvel Comics' All-Winners Squad. The team made their true debut in Super-Soldier: Man of War #1, though in the Amalgam universe, their first appearance was most likely in the All-Star Winners Comics series.

Situated in Metropolis, The All-Star Winners Squadron were a team of superheroes who defended both the city and America in the era during and after World War II. It seemed that Super-Soldier was the leader of the team, as everyone (excluding the Aqua-Mariner) looked up to him. Brooklyn Barnes of the Young Commandos was on the team as well, as the team's mascot.

The team was first formed when Human Lantern, The Whiz and Aqua Mariner came together originally to find Atlantis. American Belle and Super Soldier followed respectively, and Super Soldier soon became their elected leader, with Brooklyn Barnes as their honorary member.

During its' time, Super Soldier and Aqua Mariner frequently squabbled during meetings, which was soon resolved by neither of them speaking to one another.

The All-Star Winners Squadron became a popular team with fans due to the nostalgia of Golden Age comics that was captured in their debut issue.

The Santa Matilde, or SM4.1, is a legendary sports car designed and produced in Brazil by Cia. Industrial Santa Matilde between 1977 and 1997.

Conception.

Equipped with tuned versions of the Chevrolet Opala engine, the first prototype was revealed at the 1976 Salão do Automóvel as one of the most expensive and luxurious cars in the country at the time. It featured items like retractable bumpers, power windows, hidden radio antenna, cassette player, retractable seat belts, leather seats with fine adjustment and air conditioning.

The project was run by engineer Humberto Pimentel Duarte and former pilot and race-car tuner Renato Peixoto. The body design came from Humberto's daughter Ana Lídia and was not based on any previous car, although a few details were inspired by Porsche models.

Characteristics.

The Santa Matilde has a fiberglass body reinforced with polyester, weighing only 66 kg. It is a 2+2 coupe, but has good space for rear passengers.
 
Two engines were available; a 6 cylinder 210 hp (157 kW), or a 4 cylinder turbo, also with 210 hp.  Both versions are highly tuned engines from the Chevrolet Opala, featuring a specially designed exhaust manifold and a different carburetor.

The car has smoothly integrated direction and rear lights. The lower front air intakes are used for the air conditioning and the internal ventilation.

The instrument panel resembles the contemporary Porsche version and has indicators for water temperature, oil pressure, speed, odometer (full and partial), RPM, fuel level and a clock.

The Santa Matilde was conceived to offer safety to the driver and passengers: it had retractable bumpers, made of a rubber compound with steel frames. The car also has a progressive deformation structure and both front and rear disc brakes.

Generations.

Santa Matilde Mk 1.



Santa Matilde Mk 2.








Santa Matilde Mk 3.











Santa Matilde Mk 3 cabriolet.

Line-produced between 1986 and 1990, this was a convertible version of the Mk 3. 

Santa Matilde Mk 4.








Santa Matilde Mk 5.

A lot of modifications were introduced in this model:

 New independent differential from the Chevrolet Omega;
 New rear suspension;
 Many design changes;
 Digital instrument panel;

Less than 3 were produced by demand in 1997. It has inestimable value for collectors.







Future.

Cia. Industrial Santa Matilde is trying to return to the specialist car production market and many expect this to happen soon.

Ultra Software Corporation was a spinoff company created in 1988 as a subsidiary of Konami of America, in an effort to get around Nintendo of America's strict licensing rules.  One of these rules was that a third-party company could only publish up to five games per year for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US. This was hardly convenient for Konami, which had begun releasing more than ten games a year for both the Famicom and Famicom Disk System in Japan. With a greater library than they were allowed to localize, Konami formed the Ultra Games brand to extend their annual library to ten games a year.

Ultra's first two NES games were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (based on the TV series) and Metal Gear (a port/adaption of the MSX2 game of the same name). At first, Ultra was dedicated to localizing Konami's pre-existing software from Japan, but later they began publishing works from other companies as well. Some of Konami's most notable games released under the Ultra label include Operation C (a Game Boy game from the Contra series), Snake's Revenge (a semi-sequel to the original Metal Gear) and the various Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles titles for the NES and Game Boy. 

After the North American launch of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo became less strict on the number of games third-parties could publish. As a result, Ultra Games began losing its purpose and Konami shortly dropped the label in 1992. 

In Europe, Konami established the Palcom Software Limited subsidiary for similar purposes. Their library was similar to Ultra's, but the company also published games that were not released in America such as Parodius and Pop'n Twinbee.

The Type XIV U-boat was a modification of the Type IXD, designed to resupply other U-boats. Because they were nicknamed "Milchkuh/Milchkühe (pl.)" (milk cows), a common name for them was milchcow.  They had no offensive weaponry, only antiaircraft guns.  In the middle part of World War II, the Milk Cows successfully allowed the smaller Type VIIC boats to raid the American coast during the "second happy time".  The milk cows were of course a priority target for all Allied forces, and improved radar and air coverage eliminated them during 1943.  Milk cow duty was especially hazardous; 289 sailors were killed out of an estimated complement of 530-576 men.

Ten boats of this type were commissioned:
U-459, U-460, 
U-461, U-462, 
U-463, U-464, 
U-487, U-488,
U-489, and U-490.

Fourteen planned Type XIVs were cancelled.  Three of them (U-491, U-492, U-493) were about 75% done when all work was stopped and they were scrapped in July and August 1943.  The other 11 had not been laid down when they were cancelled on May 27, 1944. On that same day Karl Dönitz dropped development plans for the Type XX U-boats, large transport boats that would not have been ready until the summer of 1945.

The upper house, the Shura Council, has 40 members appointed by the King of Bahrain, with the stated aim of giving a voice to minority communities and technocratic experts within the legislative process. Supporters of the system refer to long established democracies the United Kingdom and Canada operating with this bicameralism with an appointed upper chamber and an elected lower chamber. Opponents of this system point out that unlike the bicameral systems in the UK and Canada, the Bahraini system gives the unelected upper house equal or more legislative power than the elected lower house, allowing the King to control all legislation. Opponents also point out that the current system was imposed unilaterally by the King, violating the  and a 2001 signed agreement with the Bahraini opposition.

Past elections.

2002 Parliamentary election.

The elections in 2002 were the first since the late emir Shaikh Isa ibn Salman al-Khalifa dissolved the first elected parliament in 1975 and abrogated the 1973 Constitution (see: History of Bahrain).

On 24 October 2002, men and women went to the polls in Bahrain to vote in parliamentary elections for the new National Assembly. The poll was the first national election in which women had the right to vote and stand as candidates (see Women's political rights in Bahrain for more details). The 2002 elections were at the core of democratic reforms launched by King Hamad when he became King in 1999. The Kingdom's political associations are gearing up to contest the general elections in September 2006. 

The largest opposition party Al Wefaq called for the restriction of the rights of elected MPs, campaigning for their legislative powers on issues related to the rights of women and children to be given to unelected clerics. In November 2005 they began a campaign for Bahrain's constitution to be amended to reflect this. 
 
According to Rulers in parliamentary elections at 24 October 2002 the Sunni Islamists and independents won 16 of 40 seats. Turnout was 53.2%. In a second round held on October 31, the independents won 12 seats and the Islamists 9. The secular representatives or independents secure a total of 21 of the 40 seats. No women candidates were elected. 

Candidates ran as individuals in the 2002 elections, but are organised in parliament as members of de facto political parties known as 'political societies'.

Islamic philosophy (                 ) is a branch of Islamic studies, and is a longstanding attempt to create harmony between philosophy (reason) and  the religious teachings of Islam (faith).

Definition.

The attempt to fuse religion and philosophy is difficult because there are no clear preconditions. Philosophers typically hold that one must accept the possibility of truth from any source and follow the argument wherever it leads.  On the other hand, classical religious believers have a set of religious principles that they hold to be unchallengeable fact.  Given these divergent goals and views, some hold that one cannot simultaneously be a philosopher and a true adherent of Islam, which is believed to be a revealed religion by its adherents. In this view, all attempts at synthesis ultimately fail.

However, others believe that a synthesis between Islam and philosophy is possible. One way to find a synthesis is to use philosophical arguments to prove that one's preset religious principles are true. This is a common technique found in the writings of many religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, but this is not generally accepted as true philosophy by philosophers. Another way to find a synthesis is to abstain from holding as true any religious principles of one's faith at all, unless one independently comes to those conclusions from a philosophical analysis. However, this is not generally accepted as being faithful to one's religion by adherents of that religion. A third, rarer and more difficult path is to apply analytical philosophy to one's own religion. In this case a religious person would also be a philosopher, by asking questions such as: 

What is the nature of God? How do we know that God exists?
What is the nature of revelation?  How do we know that God reveals his will to mankind?
What is the nature of divinely guided Messengers vis à vis philosophers?
What is the nature of Imamat or vicegerency of humans on earth?
Which of our religious traditions must be interpreted literally?
Which of our religious traditions must be interpreted allegorically?
What must one actually believe to be considered a true adherent of our religion?
How can one reconcile the findings of philosophy with religion?
How can one reconcile the findings of science with religion?

 Introduction .
Islamic philosophy may be defined in a number of different ways, but the perspective taken here is that it represents the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture. This description does not suggest that it is necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor even that it is exclusively produced by Muslims. Leaman, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy

 Formative influences .
Islamic philosophy as the name implies refers to philosophical activity within the Islamic milieu. The main sources of classical or early Islamic philosophy are the religion of Islam itself (especially ideas derived and interpreted from Quran), Greek philosophy which the early Muslims inherited as a result of conquests when Alexandria, Syria and Jundishapur came under Muslim rule, along with pre-Islamic Iranian and Indian philosophy. Many of the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and reason, the latter exemplified by Greek philosophy.

 Early and Classical Islamic philosophy .


In early Islamic thought two main currents may be distinguished. The first is Kalam, that mainly dealt with theological questions, and the other is Falsafa, that was founded on the reception of Greek thought.

Kalam.
Independent minds exploiting the methods of ijtihad sought to investigate the doctrines of the Qur'an, which until then had been accepted in faith on the authority of divine revelation. One of first debates was that between partisan of the Qadar (Arabic: qadara, to have power), who affirmed free will, and the Jabarites (jabar, force, constraint), who maintained the belief in fatalism. 

At the second century of the Hegira, a new movement arose in the theological school of Basra, Iraq. A pupil, Wasil ibn Ata, who was expelled from the school because his answers were contrary to then orthodox Islamic tradition and became leader of a new school, and systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Qadarites. This new school was called Mutazilite (from i'tazala, to separate oneself, to dissent). Its principal dogmas were three: 

God is an absolute unity, and no attribute can be ascribed to Him.
Man is a free agent. It is on account of these two principles that the Mu'tazilites designate themselves the "Partisans of Justice and Unity".
All knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason; humans could acquire knowledge before, as well as after, Revelation, by the sole light of reason. This fact makes knowledge obligatory upon all men, at all times, and in all places.

The Mutazilites, compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox Islam of their day, looked for support in philosophy, and are one of the first to pursue a rational theology called Ilm-al-Kalam (Scholastic theology); those professing it were called Mutakallamin. This appellation became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles. The first Mutakallamin had to debate both the orthodox and the non-Muslims, and they may be described as occupying the middle ground between those two parties. But subsequent generations were to large extent critical towards the Mutazilite school, especially after formation of the Asharite concepts.

Falsafa.

From the ninth century onward, owing to Caliph al-Ma'mun and his successor, Greek philosophy was introduced among the Persians and Arabs, and the Peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them; such were Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and Ibn Rushd (Averroës), all of whose fundamental principles were considered as criticized by the Mutakallamin.

During the Abbasid caliphate a number of thinkers and scientists, many of them non-Muslims or heretical Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, Hindu, and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the Christian West. They contributed to making Aristotle known in Christian Europe. Three speculative thinkers, the two Persians al-Farabi and Avicenna and the Arab al-Kindi, combined Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam. They were considered by many as highly unorthodox and by some were even described as non-Islamic philosophers. 

From Spain Arabic philosophic literature was translated into Hebrew and Latin, contributing to the development of modern European philosophy. The philosophers Moses Maimonides (a Jew born in Muslim Spain) and precursor of sociology and historiography Ibn Khaldun (born in modern-day Tunisia) were also important.

Some differences between Kalam and Falsafa.
Aristotle attempted to demonstrate the unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world. To assert that God's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe, and not to individual and accidental things, is tantamount to denying prophecy. One other point shocked the faith of the Mutakallamin   the theory of intellect. The Peripatetics taught that the human soul was only an aptitude   a faculty capable of attaining every variety of passive perfection   and that through information and virtue it became qualified for union with the active intellect, which latter emanates from God. To admit this theory would be to deny the immortality of the soul.

Wherefore the Mutakallamin had, before anything else, to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter, and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by Democritus. They taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension. Originally atoms were created by God, and are created now as occasion seems to require. Bodies come into existence or die, through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms. But this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter. 

For, indeed, if it be supposed that God commenced His work at a certain definite time by His "will," and for a certain definite object, it must be admitted that He was imperfect before accomplishing His will, or before attaining His object. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to Time, and claimed that just as Space is constituted of atoms and vacuum, Time, likewise, is constituted of small indivisible moments. The creation of the world once established, it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a Creator, and that God is unique, omnipotent, and omniscient.

Jewish philosophy in the Arab world in the classical period.

The oldest Jewish religio-philosophical work preserved is that of Saadia Gaon (892-942), Emunot ve-Deot, "The Book of Beliefs and Opinions". In this work Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia there was no problem as to creation: God created the world ex nihilo, just as the Bible attests; and he contests the theory of the Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter.

To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Mutakallamin. Only the attributes of essence (sifat al-dhatia) can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (sifat-al-fi'aliya). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the celestial spheres. Here Saadia controverts the Mutakallamin, who considered the soul an "accident" arad (compare Guide for the Perplexed i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: "Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: "If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love," etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views; just as the Jewish and Muslim Peripatetics stopped short in their respective Aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion.

Main protagonists of falsafa and their critics.
The twelfth century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the Kalam, which latter, being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. This supreme exaltation of philosophy may be attributed, in great measure, to Al-Ghazali (1005-1111) among the Persians, and to Judah ha-Levi (1140) among the Jews. It can be argued that the attacks directed against the philosophers by Ghazali in his work, "Tahafut al-Falasifa" (The Destruction of the Philosophers), not only produced, by reaction, a current favorable to philosophy, but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism. They thereafter made their theories clearer and their logic closer. The influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the Islamic Peripatetic school ever produced, namely, Ibn Bajjah (Avempace) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes), both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy. 

Since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Persian or Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, the Persian Ghazali found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the "Kuzari," in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Mutakallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, "I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them" ("Kuzari," v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Mutakallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: "Does the Kalam give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in Judah ha-Levi's eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament. 

Ibn Rushd (or Ibn Roshd or Averroës), the contemporary of Maimonides, closed the first great philosophical era of the Muslims. The boldness of this great commentator of Aristotle aroused the full fury of the orthodox, who, in their zeal, attacked all philosophers indiscriminately, and had all philosophical writings committed to the flames. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Tufail, who only follow the teachings of Ibn Sina and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Ibn Rushd admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter.

But while Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and other Persian and Muslim philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas, Ibn Rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, "Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ex nihilo" (Munk, "Mélanges," p. 444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Ibn Sina declared in order to make concessions to the orthodox  but also a necessity. 

Driven from the Islamic schools, Islamic philosophy found a refuge with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men such as the Ibn Tibbons, Narboni, Gersonides joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Rushd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ibn Aknin, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Rushd's commentary.

It should be mentioned that this depiction of intellectual tradition in Islamic Lands is mainly dependent upon what West could understand (or was willing to understand) from this long era. In contrast, there are some historians and philosophers who do not agree with this account and describe this era in a completely different way. Their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on Islamic Philosophy, especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd. (For more discussion, refer to the History of Islamic Philosophy by Henry Corbin.)

 Later Islamic philosophy .
The death of Ibn Rushd effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Peripatetic Arabic School, and philosophical activity declined significantly in western Islamic countries, namely in Spain and North Africa, though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular Iran and India. 

Since the political power shift in Western Europe (Spain and Portugal) from Muslim to Christian control, the Muslims naturally did not practice philosophy in Western Europe. This also led to some loss of contact between the 'west' and the 'east' of the Islamic world. Muslims in the 'east' continued to do philosophy, as is evident from the works of Ottoman scholars and especially those living in Muslim kingdoms within the territories of present day Iran and India, such as Shah Waliullah and Ahmad Sirhindi. This fact has escaped most pre-modern historians of Islamic (or Arabic) philosophy. In addition, logic has continued to be taught in religious seminaries up to modern times. 

After Ibn Rushd, there arose many later schools of Islamic Philosophy. We can mention just a few, such as the those founded by Ibn Arabi, Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra.  These new schools are of particular importance, as they are still active in the Islamic world.

 Post-classical Iranian Muslim philosophy .
Post-classical Islamic philosophers are usually divided into two main categories according to their affiliation with the Sunni and Shia denominations. Of course, there are many contemporary philosophers and thinkers such as Professor Nasr and Imam Musa Sadr who do not accept the importance of this classification. But there is a consensus that we can categorize this era according to the two main approaches: thinkers who mainly worked within the Shi a tradition and thinkers who did not. If we accept this division then we can summarize each category as follows (it should be mentioned that this classification has many overlaps, is not very clear and precise).

 Modern Islamic philosophy .


The tradition of Islamic Philosophy is still very much alive today despite the belief in many Western circles that this tradition ceased after the golden ages of Suhrawardi s Hikmat al-Ishraq (Illumination Philosophy) or, at the latest, Mulla Sadra s Hikmat-e-Mota aliye or Transcendent (Exalted) Philosophy. Another unavoidable name is Allama Muhammad Iqbal who reshaped and revitalized Islamic philosophy amongst the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in the early 20th century. Beside his Urdu and Persian poetical work, The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam  is a milestone in the modern political philosophy of Islam.

In contemporary Islamic Lands, the teaching of hikmat or hikmah has continued and flourished.

Among the traditional masters of Islamic philosophy most active during the past two decades may be mentioned 
the Iranian                or Allameh Tabatabaei, the author of numerous works including the twenty seven-volume Quranic commentary al-Mizan (       ), ;
Sayyid Abul-Hasan Rafi i Qazwini (                         ) the great master of Mulla Sadra's school who has written a few treasured works but has trained many outstanding students such as Sayyid Jalal-al-Din Ashtiyani (                  ), who has studied with both him and Allamah Tabatabai, and ;
Allamah Muhammad Salih Ha iri Simnanin, the most loyal follower of Peripatetic philosophy and opposed to Mulla Sadra's school. ;

The younger traditional scholars who have been most active recently in Islamic Philosophy include 
Mirza Mahdi Ha iri, the only one of the traditional class of hakims with an extensive experience of the West and author of Ilm-I Kulli and Kavoshha-ye Aqli-Nazari; ;
Murtaza Motahhari, the best student of Allamah Tabatabai, a martyr of the Iran Islamic Revolution; and ;
Seyyed Hossein Nasr.

In Malaysia, Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas is a prominent metaphysical thinker.

Declan Devine is the current first team coach of Scottish Premier League side Dunfermline Athletic.

Playing Career.
In his younger days, Devine played for numerous clubs, including Glentoran F.C., Omagh Town F.C., Derry City F.C. and Institute F.C. before hanging up his boots to become a coach.

Coaching. 
Devine began his coaching career with Derry City's current assistant manager and then Institute manager, Paul Hegarty. Following fairly limited success, Devine followed Hegarty to The Brandywell where he became head goalkeeping coach. It was here where Devine received an unprecedented amount of plaudits as he coached current Cardiff City F.C. goalkeeper David Forde and was part of the backroom team responsible for delivering two League Cups and an FAI Cup. Following this success, Devine was signed by Dunfermline Athletic on 05 December, 2006, following recommendations from manager Stephen Kenny who had previously worked with Devine at Derry City. Devine described the move as a "massive wrench" but felt for personal reasons that he needed to move on.

Armstrong Audio, originally called Armstrong Wireless and Television Ltd. was a British manufacturer of radios and other audio equipment based in London, England. Founded by Claude Charles Jackson in 1932.

 History .

Initially created to manufacture portable radios, during World War II their factory was used to manufacture radios, public address systems, and various electronic parts. After the war, they began to produce television sets, as well as long range radios for ships, but eventually ceased production of those lines to manufacture radios, amplifiers and tuners for home consumer use. In the 1950s when the high fidelity market began to take shape, the company name was changed to Armstrong Audio and they focused their marketing and manufacturing at becoming hi-fi specialists.

During the 1960s and 1970s they were extremely successful, creating several durable radio models which are still in use by consumers today, but by the end of the 1970s their lease on their factory ran out and it was decided not to invest in a new one. The building was torn down and the owners redeveloped it.

Using plans developed for a further radio model, some of the staff continued on as Armstrong Amplifiers, but due to a lack of capital and suitable manufacturing space, production did not last long.

Today, what once was Armstrong Audio is now called Armstrong Hi-Fi and Video Services and is based out of Walthamstow, and they provide maintenance contract to a number of retail stores.

John McConville (20), Walter Chapman (23), Reginald Chapman (25), Joseph Lemon (46), James McWhirter (58), Kenneth Wharton (24), Robert Chambers (19), John Bryans (46), Robert Freeburn (50) and Robert Walker (46), all Protestant civilians, were shot dead by the Republican Action Force shortly after their firm's minibus was stopped at a bogus vehicle check point while travelling home from work, Kingsmill, near Bessbrook and Whitecross. One of the Protestant men survived despite having been shot 18 times (beating Cathal Brugha's record from Easter 1916, who only was shot 16 times).

The Battle of Akroinon was fought at Akroinon (also known as Acroinon or Acroinum, near modern Afyon) in Phrygia, on the western edge of the Anatolian plateau, in 739 between an Umayyad Arab army of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, led by his brother Sulayman, and Byzantine forces led by Leo III the Isaurian and his son, the future Constantine V. In a decisive victory Leo expelled the Arab forces from Asia Minor, leaving Constantine well-placed to take advantage of the collapse of the Umayyad dynasty. 

The battle was described in detail in the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor.

<doc id="5183123" title="Valley Railroad (Connecticut)" nonfiltered="104" processed="102" dbindex="1500105">

The Valley Railroad Company is a railroad based in Connecticut originally founded in 1868. 

 Construction .
After one failed attempt to start, the Valley Railroad Company, headed by the President of the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company (James C. Walkeley), obtained the state charter to build and form this company on July 17, 1868.

During 1868-1869, survey crews worked to map out the line from Hartford to Saybrook Point, and in 1870, actual construction of the line began. With the ease of building a rail line in the Connecticut River Valley (no tunnels or major bridges), the line was completed during the summer of 1871 with the first ceremonial train run over the 45 mile line on July 29, 1871.

Two days later the first "regular" train was run and on August 24, 1871 the Connecticut Valley Railroad finally declared an official opening. The initial schedules of trains operating along the Valley Railroad called for one mixed (passenger and freight) and four passenger trains each way daily (except Sunday) with fifteen stops along the way.

Financial trouble plagued many early railroads and the Connecticut Valley found theirs in 1876 when it defaulted on its second mortgage bonds and was placed in receivership.

 Branch Line of the New Haven .
On July 1, 1880 a company called the Hartford and Connecticut Valley Railroad took control, but also at this time the New Haven Railroad was rapidly building up its stature in Southern New England. Seeing a good chance to sell their new line at a good price, the owners of the Hartford & Connecticut Valley Railroad convinced the New Haven that it should buy control. In 1882 the New Haven did and ten years later (1892), the Hartford & Connecticut Valley Railroad became part of the New Haven system.

The incorporation was good for the Valley Railroad as the New Haven put money and improvements into the line. During this time, the Valley Railroad grew to its limit: never being more than a busy branch line with passenger service and freight service consisting of deliveries of supplies and merchandise to communities and factories along the line. Shortly after World War I, as roads, automobiles, and trucks improved, the Valley Railroad saw a reduction in service; and by the late 1950s it saw only weekday local service with the speed on the line down to 30 MPH from nearly 55 MPH.

Hard times fell on the New Haven Railroad itself and in 1961 it fell into bankruptcy. With a major reduction on spending money to maintain its branch lines, the Valley Railroad soon fell into disrepair, finding only two slow moving freight trains a week using the rusted rails.

Business failed along the Valley Railroad line and the New Haven also failed. In 1968 the New Haven was no longer a railroad with the last train run over the Valley in March 1968.

 Independent railroad again .
Concerned volunteers got together to keep the now abandoned railroad from being torn up by the new owners, Penn Central. This group managed to obtain a temporary lease from Penn Central in 1969 and on August 15, 1969, the Penn Central turned over this branch line to the State of Connecticut.

The State of Connecticut granted a formal lease to the Valley Railroad Company on June 1, 1970. This lease authorized the company to use the 22.67 miles of track for freight and passenger service; and on July 29, 1971 (100 years to the day of the first ceremonial run), after thousands of hours of mostly volunteer effort, the first train of the new Valley Railroad steamed from Essex to Deep River and has been steaming ever since.

The Valley Railroad offers a number of special programs and events. Some of these, such as "Santa specials" and visits from Thomas the Tank Engine, are similar to those offered by other tourist railroads. A more unusual example is the "Your Hand on the Throttle" program, in which participants are allowed to run one of the railroad's full-size steam locomotives (under supervision).

Harry Ainlay Composite High School is a Canadian high school on the south side of Edmonton, Alberta. (Google Map) Named after the former mayor Harry Dean Ainlay, the school operated by Edmonton Public Schools, was opened in 1966, and since then has had over 20,000 alumni. One of the largest schools in western Canada, it has enjoyed a strong reputation in all major areas: academics, athletics, and the arts. In 2005, its enrollment was just under 2200 students. The school sports teams are the Titans and their mascot is named Bam-Bam, a blond Rambo-type character. The school offers full French Immersion, International Baccalaureate, Career and Technology Studies (Automotives, Cosmotology, Communication Technology, Construction, Design Studies, and Welding) and  Registered Apprenticeship programs.

Harry Ainlay hosts a yearly volleyball tournament known as TVT (Titan Volleyball Tournament), in which schools from across Edmonton and surrounding areas, as well as a few out-of-province teams, compete against each other in Junior and Senior Males and Females divisions.

The school also hosts an annual basketball tournament, Tri-Prov, named because teams from Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta compete against each other in  Junior and Senior Male and Female divisions. This tournament has a history of high level competition and is an important practice run for the teams before season finals. 

With Students' Union events such as Touch of Class, Aloha Ainlay, Halloween and Christmas week, Culturefest and Oktoberfest, the programs run by students, for students, are widespread and cover many different events throughout the year. 

There is also a strong arts prescence in the school with an IB Art Show, a Symphonic band program as well as a major drama production each year and a student directed one act play festival.

 International Baccalaureate at Ainlay .

Harry Ainlay has an I.B program rivalling that of other schools such as Ross Sheppard High School.

 French Immersion .

Harry Ainlay is one of few high schools in the Edmonton Public School district that offers full French Immersion for all core courses.

The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon; sigmoid flexure) forms a loop which averages about 40 cm. in length, and normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity. 

Path.
It begins at the superior aperture of the lesser pelvis, where it is continuous with the iliac colon, and passes transversely across the front of the sacrum to the right side of the pelvis.

It then curves on itself and turns toward the left to reach the middle line at the level of the third piece of the sacrum, where it bends downward and ends in the rectum. 

Coverings.
It is completely surrounded by peritoneum, which forms a mesentery (sigmoid mesocolon), which diminishes in length from the center toward the ends of the loop, where it disappears, so that the loop is fixed at its junctions with the iliac colon and rectum, but enjoys a considerable range of movement in its central portion. 

Relations.
Behind the sigmoid colon are the external iliac vessels, the left Piriformis, and left sacral plexus of nerves.

In front, it is separated from the bladder in the male, and the uterus in the female, by some coils of the small intestine.

<doc id="2933431" title="USS Mayrant (DD-402)" nonfiltered="109" processed="107" dbindex="1500110">


The second USS Mayrant (DD-402) was a Benham-class destroyer in the United States Navy.  She was named for John Mayrant.

Mayrant was laid down 15 April 1937 at the Boston Navy Yard, Boston, Massachusetts; launched 14 May 1938; sponsored by Mrs. E. Sheely, a descendant of Capt. John Mayrant; and commissioned 19 September1939, Lt. Comdr. E. A. Taylor in command.

During the summer of 1940, after shakedown and an extended training period, Mayrant escorted her Commander in Chief, Franklin D. Roosevelt, on a tour of east coast defenses. Later on in the year, again escorting the President, she visited island bases newly acquired from Great Britain under the "destroyers for bases" agreement.

The following spring, 1941, as U.S. involvement in European hostilities increased, the Navy expanded its efforts to keep the sealanes open. In May, the limits of the neutrality patrol were extended and the Navy gradually expanded its responsibilities for transatlantic convoys. By September, it was officially responsible for protecting them as far as Iceland, lengthening the patrols of the Support Force, Atlantic Fleet, which had been assigned the task.

Mayrant, on duty with that force, operated off Newfoundland during the spring and summer. In August she stood-by during the Atlantic Charter Conferences and, at their conclusion, escorted HMS Prince of Wales, carrying Prime Minister Winston Churchill, to Great Britain.

In late October, Mayrant joined a convoy from Halifax to Capetown. Two days out of the latter port, on 7 December 1941, she received news of the U.S. entry into the war. She then joined Royal Navy ships protecting convoys transporting British and Canadian troops to South Africa. She returned to the United States January 1942, and for the next 5 months engaged in North Atlantic convoy duty. In April, she sailed to Scapa Flow where she joined the British Home Fleet. As a unit of that fleet she participated in operations in the Denmark Strait in search of the German battleship Tirpitz in addition to escorting several conveys on the "suicide run" to Murmansk.

Mayrant returned to the east coast in July and immediately put her experience to work conducting antisubmarine warfare training exercises in the Caribbean. Relieved of that duty in October, she resumed convoy work. She escorted troops to north Africa for the November invasions and provided fire support off Casablanca 8 and 9 November. Continuing her support activities, she helped to insure the safe passage of supplies to the area into the new year, 1943.

Following the success of the north African invasion Mayrant spent several months on convoy duty off the east coast, returning to north African waters in May. Passing through the Straits of Gibraltar. she arrived Mers-el Kebir, 23 May. "Throughout June she cruised the north African coast from Oran to Bizerte, escorting convoys and conducting antisubmarine patrols. On 14 July, she shifted her base of operations north toward to Sicily. While on anti air patrol off Palermo, 26 July, she was attacked by Luftwaffe dive bombers.

A near miss, only a yard or two off her port bow, during this encounter caused extensive damage. Her side ruptured and her engineering space flooded, she was towed into Palermo with five dead and 18 wounded. When the engineering space of a ship is flooded, the ship usually sinks. However, heroic action of her crew and able assistance of several other ships who pumped water and provided electric power, kept the Mayrand floating as she crawled back to harbor. Her executive officer was later awarded the Silver Star for his action in saving the ship. His name: Franklin Roosevelt Jr. In port, mattresses were stuffed into the holes of the ships sides. In spite of her damage, the destroyer's secondary guns helped repel several Luftwaffe raids on Palermo during the next week. On 9 August, she was towed to Malta where temporary repairs were completed by 14 November. She then steamed to Charleston, South Carolina for extensive yard repairs.

Back in fighting trim 15 May 1944 she departed Charleston for Casco Bay, Maine. For the next year she operated primarily along the east coast, escorting new cruisers and aircraft carriers on shakedown and protecting coastal convoys. During this year she also escorted two convoys to the Mediterranean.

On patrol off New England, 5 April 1945, Mayrant went to the rescue of the cargo ship Atlantic States, torpedoed off Cape Cod Light. Despite heavy weather, the destroyer transferred members of her crew to the powerless merchantman and took her in tow. For 2 days until oceangoing tugs had her under control, they battled waves and breaking lines to keep Atlantic States from drifting and sinking.

The war in Europe drawing to a close, Mayrant transferred to the Pacific Fleet. She arrived Pearl Harbor 21 May and underwent intensive training in shore bombardment and night operations. On 2 June she sailed for Ulithi escorting convoys to Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Saipan. After the end of hostilities, Mayrant was designated to make preliminary arrangements for the surrender of the enemy garrison on Marcus, a bypassed island in the central Pacific. With the official surrender of the island 31 August, the destroyer took up air-sea rescue operations in the Marshalls and Marianas.

On 30 December, Mayrant arrived at San Diego for a brief stay before heading back to the central Pacific. Designated as test ship for Operation Crossroads, the 1946 atomic bomb tests, she arrived Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands, 31 May 1946. Surviving the tests, but too highly contaminated, Mayrant decommissioned at Bikini 28 August 1946. She was sunk off 4 April 1948 off Kwajalein and struck from the Navy Register on the 30th.

Mayrant received three battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="308353" title="Music of Tennessee" nonfiltered="110" processed="108" dbindex="1500111">


The story of Tennessee's contribution to American music is essentially the story of two cities: Nashville and Memphis.  Nashville is most famous for its status as the long-time capital of country music. Memphis musicians had huge influence on blues, early rock and roll, and soul music.

 Nashville .

Nashville, the most populated metropolitan area in the state, is home to the Grand Ole Opry and the Country Music Hall of Fame, and bears the nickname "Music City, U.S.A.". By the 1950s, the city's record labels dominated the genre with slick pop-country (Nashville sound).  Performers reacting against the Nashville sound formed their own scenes in Lubbock, Texas and Bakersfield, California, the latter of which (Bakersfield sound) became the most popular type of country by the late 1960s, led by Merle Haggard.  Nashville's predominance in county music was regained by the early 1980s, when Dwight Yoakam and other neo-traditionalists entered the charts. Today, there is a developing metalcore scene.

 Memphis .

Memphis' most significant musical claims to fame are as the apparent "Birthplace of the Blues" and "Birthplace of Rock and Roll".  Famed African-American composer W.C. Handy is said to have written the first commercially successful blues song "St. Louis Blues" in a bar on Beale Street in 1912, and Memphis was a center of blues music for much of the 20th century (see Memphis blues).  In the 1940s, Memphis was the home of blues guitar legend B.B. King.  In 1952, Sam Phillips started Sun Records, a seminal early rock and roll and electric blues label.  Among the artists who made their first recordings on Sun were Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Ike Turner, Carl Perkins, and Charlie Rich.  In the 1960s and 1970s, the city was home to Stax Records, a legendary soul music record label.  Stax put out funky, distinctly Southern records by artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, and Wilson Pickett that stood in sharp contrast to the smoother, more pop records coming out of Detroit's Motown (see Memphis soul).  More recently, it has been the home of Memphis rap, typified by Three 6 Mafia.

Punk rock.
Punk rock has never been strongly embraced in Tennessee, with the exception being Memphis's River City Hardcore scene in the 80's and 90's.  A few hardcore punk bands gained a following, including His Hero Is Gone (Memphis), Committee for Public Safety (Nashville), From Ashes Rise (Nashville), and bands like Johnny Fives, The Malignmen and STD (Knoxville). Knoxville's small but active punk scene reached its peak during the mid-90s. It was tied closely to The Mercury Theatre, a popular all-ages venue where many Knoxville bands, such as Bloodhoud Gang and Superdrag, got their start.

Most bands associated with punk rock in Tennessee drew upon the state's musical heritage as an additional influence to some extent.

Ana Roque Giegel de Duprey, also known as "Flor del Valle" (Flower of the Valley), (April 18, 1853-1933 born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico), was an educator, suffragist and one of the founders of the University of Puerto Rico.

She lived among books and had learned how to write by the age of three, before her mother died.  In 1860, when Roque was seven years old, she  was sent to a regular school, and two years later graduated.  She continued her home schooling and in 1864 at the age of eleven, became the youngest teachers assistant in Puerto Rico.  In 1866, at age 13, she founded a school in her house.  She also wrote a geography textbook for her students which was later adopted by the Department of Education of Puerto Rico.  She applied for her teachers license and passed the examinations.

In 1872, she married Luis Duprey, a well-to-do landowner who was involved in politics thus, she developed an interest in the political situation of Puerto Rico.  With Duprey, she had five children however, only three survived, Luis Enrique, Borinquen and America.  The family moved to San Juan where  she became the first woman to be permitted into the Puerto Rican Athenaeum and the first woman to become member of the Public Library.  During her spare time she composed music, though things changed in 1880 when her husband died.

In 1884, Roque was offered a teacher's position in Arecibo, which she accepted.  She also enrolled at the Provincial Institute where she studied philosophy and science and earned her Bachelor's Degree.  In 1898, Roque founded the first "women's only" magazine in Puerto Rico "La Mujer".  Rogue wrote articles for the following newspapers "El Buscapie", "El Imparcial" and "El Mundo".  She was also the founder of "La Evolucion" (1902), "La Mujer del Siglo XX" in (1907), "Album Puertorriqueño" (1918) and "Heraldo de la Mujer" (1920).  In 1899, Roque was named the director of the Normal School of San Juan.  Among the many books written by Roque were the following: Sara, La Obrera and Luz y Sombra.  Her book Puerto Rican Flora received acclaim and an award from the Fourth Century Christian Civilization Organization.

In 1902, she founded a teachers' academy in her house, whose main objective was to train and prepare students who were interested in becoming teachers for their teacher's examination with the Department of Education.  Rogue founded the Liceo de Ponce (high school) and the College of Mayagüez (which later became the Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico) and she also volunteered to help establish the University of Puerto Rico.

In 1917, Roque founded the Puerto Rican Feminist League, the first feminist organization in Puerto Rico dedicated to the issues of women's rights.  In 1924, she founded the Association of Women Suffragist, which fought for the women's right to vote, a task which became a reality in 1932 and which became law for all women in 1935.  It is ironic that she was unable to vote because she forgot to register.

In 1932, the University of Puerto Rico bestowed upon Roque an honorary doctorate degree.  She was also named honorary president of the Puerto Rican Liberal Party.

In 1933, Ana Roque Giegel de Duprey died in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.  The Government of Puerto Rico has honored her memory by naming a school in Humacao and a street in San Juan after her.  There is also an elementary school in Chicago, Illinois named after Ana Roque.

<doc id="27331" title="Politics of Slovakia" nonfiltered="115" processed="113" dbindex="1500116">

Politics of Slovakia takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, with a multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in the parliament and it can be exerced in some cases also by the government or directly by citizens. Executive power is exercised by the government led by the Prime Minister. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The President is the head of state.

Legal system.
The Constitution was ratified 1 September 1992, and became effective 1 October 1992 (some parts 1 January 1993). It was amended in September 1998 to allow direct election of the president and again in February 2001 due to EU admission requirements.
The civil law system is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The legal code was modified to comply with the obligations of Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to expunge the Marxist-Leninist legal theory. Slovakia accepts the compulsory ICJ jurisdiction with reservations.

Executive branch.

|}

The president is the head of state and the formal head of the executive, though with very limited powers. The president is elected by direct, popular vote, under the two round system, for a five-year term.

Following National Council elections, the leader of the majority party or the leader of the majority coalition is usually appointed prime minister by the president. Cabinet appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister has to receive the majority in the parliament. The government coalition as of July 2006 consists of Smer, SNS and HZDS.

Legislative branch.
Slovakia's sole constitutional and legislative body is the 150-seat unicameral National Council of the Slovak Republic. Delegates are elected for 4-year terms on the basis of proportional representation.

The National Council considers and approves the Constitution, constitutional statutes and other legal acts. It also approves the state budget. It elects some officials specified by law as well as the candidates for the position of a Justice of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic and the Prosecutor General. Prior to their ratification, the parliament should approve all important international treaties. Moreover, it gives consent for dispatching of military forces outside of Slovakia's territory and for the presence of foreign military forces on the territory of the Slovak Republic.

Political parties and elections.
Suffrage:
18 years of age; universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot.

Presidential election:
The president is elected by direct, popular vote, under the two round system, for a five-year term. Two rounds of the last election were held on April 3 and April 17, 2004 (next to be held April 2009).

Parliamentary election:
Members of the National Council of the Slovak Republic are elected directly for a 4-year term, under the proportional system. Similarly to the Netherlands, the whole country forms one multi-member constituency. The election threshold is 5%. Voters may indicate their preferences within the semi-open list. Parliamentary elections were last held on June 17, 2006 (early elections).









Other election results:
-EU parliament, see European Parliament election, 2004 (Slovakia);
-Regions, see Slovak regional elections, 2005;
-local authorities, see Slovak local authority election, 2002;
-older elections, see Elections in Slovakia;

Political parties:
The Slovak political scene supports a wide spectrum of political parties including the communists (KSS) and the nationalists (SNS). New parties arise and old parties cease to exist or merge at a frequent rate. Major parties are members of the European political parties. Some parties have regional strongholds, for example SMK is supported mainly by the Hungarian minority living in southern Slovakia. Although the main political cleavage in the 1990s concerned the somewhat authoritarian policy of HZDS, the left-right conflict over economic reforms (principally between Direction - Social Democracy and Slovak Democratic and Christian Union - Democratic Party) has recently become the dominant cleavage in Slovakia's politics.

Judicial branch.
The country's highest appellate forum is the Supreme Court (Najvy¨¨í súd), the judges of which are elected by the National Council; below that are regional, district, and military courts. In certain cases the law provides for decisions of tribunals of judges to be attended by lay judges from the citizenry. Slovakia also has a special Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd), which rules on constitutional issues. The 13 members of this court are appointed by the president from a slate of candidates nominated by Parliament.

In 2002 Parliament passed legislation which created a Judicial Council. This 18-member council, composed of judges, law professors, and other legal experts, is now responsible for the nomination of judges. All judges except those of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president from a list proposed by the Judicial Council. The Council also is responsible for appointing Disciplinary Senates in cases of judicial misconduct. 

International organization participation.
Slovakia is member of ACCT (observer), Australia Group, BIS, BSEC (observer), CE, CEI, CERN, EAPC, EBRD, EIB, EU, FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICCt, ICRM, IDA, IEA, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, ITUC, MIGA, NAM (guest), NATO, NEA, NSG, OAS (observer), OECD, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNAMSIL, UNCTAD, UNDOF, UNESCO, UNFICYP, UNIDO, UNTSO, UPU, WCO, WEU (associate partner), WFTU, WHO, WIPO, Visegrád group, WMO, WToO, WTO, ZC

Komar and Melamid is an artistic team made up of Russian graphic artists Vitaly Komar (born 1943) and Alexander Melamid (born 1945).  Both artists were born in Moscow, emigrated to Israel in 1977 because they are Jewish, and subsequently to New York in 1978.  

 Education .

Komar and Melamid graduated from the Stroganov School of Design in 1967; they began working together shortly thereafter. After 36 years they separated in 2003.  

 Style .
  
They are perhaps best known as the founders of Sots Art, a form of Soviet Nonconformist Art that combined elements of Socialist Realism and Western Pop Art in a conceptual framework that also references Dadaism.  Komar and Melamid often create many works within a common theme.  Their prolific collaboration precludes from mentioning all of their projects, however, some of their best known series and projects are:  Sots Art series (1972-1973), Post-Art series (1973), Ancestral Portraits series (1980), Nostalgic Socialist Realism series (1982-1983), Diary series (1984-1986), Anarchistic Synthesism series (1985-1986), Most-Wanted series (1993-1997), Monumental Propaganda (1994), Elephant Project (1995-2000), American Dreams (1994-1999).

Emil Dechebal Matasareanu (July 19, 1966 February 28, 1997) is best known as one of two men who robbed a Bank of America in North Hollywood, California, on February 28, 1997.  He was born in Romania and grew up in Altadena.  
Following the robbery, he and his accomplice, Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr., participated in a massive daylight shootout with police.

As they were occupied with robbing the bank and keeping control of their hostages, a large number of police officers gathered outside, as a result of an officer's request for backup and his report of the suspects being armed with automatic AK-47 rifles. 

As the suspects were about to flee the scene, they encountered the police officers outside and opened fire, shooting wildly for several minutes.
Later, Matasareanu drove the getaway car while Phillips walked alongside it and continued shooting at the police. After some time, they were separated. Philips, surrounded by police, committed suicide with a Beretta 92F handgun when his AK-47 jammed.

Finally, the SWAT team arrived and after a brief shootout, they wounded Matasareanu. Taking cover behind a truck, Matasareanu continued to fire until he had been shot in the legs and feet by SWAT sharpshooters so many times that he collapsed against the hood of the car. He later died of his wounds at the scene. He was hit 29 times.

The Matasareanu family later filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department for taking too long to provide him with medical attention, and also for reported brutality against Emil as he was handcuffed in the street. The city responded by saying that Matasareanu's constant taunts for police to "shoot me in the head" had caused police to worry that he may have booby trapped himself.  The first trial resulted in a hung jury, and the lawsuit was later dropped.

Emil Matasareanu is survived by two sons, Alexander and Emil Jr.

The Alsek River is a wilderness river flowing from the Yukon into Northern British Columbia and into Alaska. 

It starts at the confluence of the Dezadeash and Kaskawulsh rivers in Kluane National Park and Reserve. After flowing south into the northwestern tip of British Columbia, it is joined by the  Tatshenshini River in Tatshenshini-Alsek Park. It reaches the Pacific Ocean at Dry Bay, in the Gulf of Alaska, south of Yakutat, Alaska close to  the northern end of the Alaska Panhandle. Although the river is navigable by kayak or rubber raft in its northern reaches, it rapidly becomes unnavigable for any but the most experienced and skilled kayakers at Turnback Canyon. 

The first known kayak descent of Turnback Canyon was by Dr. Walt Blackadar, who ran the canyon solo on August 25, 1971. He wrote about his trip for Sports Illustrated. "This has been a day!," he wrote in his journal. "I want any other kayaker or would-be expert to read my words well. The Alsek Gorge is unpaddleable!" Despite this sincere warning from a man who apparently felt lucky to be alive, groups of expert kayakers have successfully run Turnback Canyon since then. A prominent mountain which overlooks the Alsek was named Mount Blackadar in his honor.

On older maps, the Alsek river is labeled as the Tatshenshini and vice versa. Some Yukon First Nation elders also refer to the river as the Tatshenshini. 

The river flows next to the Lowell glacier which blocked off the river from 1725 to 1850 and created a large lake behind it. When the glacier broke in 1850, it created a massive flood, washing away everything in its path on the way to the Pacific.

The portion of the river inside Kluane National Park has been designated a Canadian Heritage River.

<doc id="1569157" title="Law of majestas" nonfiltered="123" processed="121" dbindex="1500124">
The Law of Majestas, or lex maiestas, refers to any one of several ancient Roman laws (leges maiestatis) throughout the republican and Imperial periods dealing with crimes against the Roman people, state, or Emperor.

In Roman law the offences originally falling under the head of treason were almost exclusively those committed in military service. The very name perduellio, the name of the crime in the older Roman law, is a proof of this. Perduelles were, strictly, public enemies who bore arms against the state; and traitors were regarded as having no more rights than public enemies. The Twelve Tables made it punishable with death to communicate with the enemy or to betray a citizen to the enemy. Other kinds of perduellio were punished by interdiction of fire and water. The crime was tried before a special tribunal, the duumviri perduellionis, perhaps the earliest permanent criminal court existing at Rome.

At a later period the name of perduellio gave place to that of laesa majestas, deminuta or minuta majestas, or simply majestas. The lex Julia majestatis, to which the date of 48 B.C. has been conjecturally assigned, continued to be the basis of the Roman law of treason until the latest period of the empire. The original text of the law appears to have still dealt with what were chiefly military offences, such as sending letters or messages to the enemy, giving up a standard or fortress, and desertion.

With the empire the law of majestas received an enormous development, mainly in the reign of Tiberius, and led to the rise of a class of professional informers, called delatores. The conception of the emperor as divine had much to do with this. It became a maxim that treason was next to sacrilege in gravity.

The law as it existed in the time of Justinian is contained chiefly in the titles of the Digest and Codex  Ad legem Juliam majestatis. The definition given in the Digest (taken from Ulpian) is this: "majestatis crimes illud est quod adversus populum Romanum vel adversus securitatem ejus committitur." Of treasons other than military offences, some of the more noticeable were the raising of an army or levying war without the command of the emperor, the questioning of the emperor's choice of a successor, the murder of (or conspiracy to murder) hostages or certain magistrates of high rank, the occupation of public places, the meeting within the city of persons hostile to the state with weapons or stones, incitement to sedition or administration of unlawful oaths, release of prisoners justly confined, falsification of public documents, and failure of a provincial governor to quit his province at the expiration of his office or to deliver his army to his successor.

The intention (voluntas) was punishable as much as an overt act (effectus). "Principes instar deorum ease" are the words of Tacitus. This crime was called laesa majestas divina in later law. It was not treason to repair a statue of the emperor which had decayed from age, to hit such a statue with a stone thrown by chance, to melt down such a statue if unconsecrated, to use mere verbal insults against the emperor, to fail in keeping an oath sworn by the emperor or to decide a case contrary to an imperial constitution.

Treason was one of the publica judicia, i.e. one of those crimes in which any citizen was entitled to prosecute. The law deprived the accused in a charge of treason of his ordinary remedy for malicious prosecution, and also took from him the privilege (which those accused of other crimes generally possessed) of immunity from accusation by women or infamous persons, from liability to be put to the torture, and from having his slaves tortured to make them testify against him.

The punishment from the time of Tiberius was death (usually by beheading) and confiscation of property, coupled with complete civil disability. A traitor could not make a will or a gift or emancipate a slave. Even the death of the accused, if guilty of treason of the gravest kind, such as levying war against the state, did not extinguish the charge, but the memory of the deceased became infamous, and his property was forfeited as though he had been convicted in his lifetime.

This battle took place on 28 September 1644 about 70 miles from Rhodes, when 6 Maltese galleys under Boisbaudran defeated several Turkish sailing ships.

The Maltese San Lorenzo, Santa Maria and Vittoria overhauled and attacked a Turkish galleon, while San Giuseppe and San Giovanni captured a smaller sailing ship and the "capitana" chased a vessel which turned out to be Greek, before returning to fight the galleon. After 7 hours, she was captured, with 220 of the 600 or more on board dead. The prisoners included one of the Sultans wives and her young son. Boisbaudran was killed, and the senior captain, Cotoner, of San Lorenzo, took over command. Maltese casualties were 82 killed and 170 wounded, exclusive of the rowing crews. On the voyage home there were several storms, and eventually the galleon was abandoned near Malta, and ended up wrecked on the Calabrian coast.

In David Eddings' fantasy saga The Belgariad, Chamdar is an Angarak sorcerer and servant of Torak.  He was the protegé of Torak's disciple Ctuchik, and, like the wizard, does not age. 



Chamdar's task for the several centuries of his life was to find and kill the heir to the Rivan throne.  His task was not an easy one, as the Rivan royal family was very effectively hidden by the sorceress Polgara, daughter of Belgarath.  To find the Rivan king, he tailed Belgarath for decades on and off; the latter took great pleasure in spending years at a time leading Chamdar on elaborate wild goose chases.  Unfortunately, Chamdar managed to find the descendants of the Rivan kings from time to time, often spelling near-disaster.

On one of those occasions, shorty after the Battle of Vo Mimbre, Chamdar showed his true ambitions.  Having found the current Rivan heir, he preyed on his latent egotism to draw him into a phony sect of the Bear Cult (who believe that the Rivan king will lead them to victory against the rest of the world).  Chamdar, rather than kill him, intended to present him to Torak himself, gaining power far beyond what Ctuchik would allow him.  Luckily, Polgara and Belgarath were able to intervene in time to break Chamdar's control over the young Rivan's mind and send him scurrying away.

Chamdar's next encounter with the Rivan line was somewhat less fortuitous.  Polgara had closeted the family away in Annath, a remote village in Sendaria whose chief resource was its stone quarry.  Chamdar killed the eldest of the Rivan line, Darral, by causing a landslide in the quarry.  He then used the shock of Darral's death to drive his wife insane, turning her into a pawn that he would use to great advantage later.  When Darral's daughter-in-law was due to have a baby, Chamdar caused the late Darral's wife to wander off into the forest, luring Polgara after her.  While the sorceress was away, he set fire to the house that the last remaining members of the Rivan family were in, burning all to their deaths but the baby Garion (later Belgarion).  A vengeful Belgarath, arriving moments too late, was only kept from killing Chamdar by having the baby thrown at him while the Angarak sorcerer made his getaway.

Chamdar continued to lurk near Garion while he grew up, and nearly succeeded in capturing him in the palace of Val Alorn.  Garion only barely escaped from him and back to safety, only for the group to be caught later on in the Forest of the Dryads. There, without Belgarath around to help, Chamdar revealed himself, forcing Polgara to agree to come before Torak as his destined bride. However, upon Polgara's calling Chamdar a swine, the Grolim hit her and Garion was driven to finally avenge his parents, the injustice just done to Polgara, as well as completely embrace his growing powers of sorcery by burning Chamdar to death. This act would plague Garion's dreams for decades to come.

Notes.
 Of all the Grolims and Torak's disciples, Chamdar is the most cunning one, as the only one who managed to kill four of Belgarath's and Polgara's protégés right under their very nose.
 Many editions of Seeress of Kell mistakenly refer to the Arendish god Chaldan as Chamdar on several occasions.

There are officially eleven cities in Ireland between the two jurisdictions in Ireland, five of these in Northern Ireland and six of them in the Republic of Ireland. The majority of these cities were established as cities prior to the partition of Ireland in 1922 and only in Northern Ireland have new cities been created subsequent to this partition.

Republic of Ireland.

Cities in the Republic of Ireland are legally defined by the Local Government Act (2001), with one historic city (Kilkenny, legally a town) permitted continued ceremonial usage. There is no modern equivalent of the system in the United Kingdom of award by the reigning monarch of letters patent to upgrade a place to a city. Dublin is the only city mentioned in the Constitution of Ireland; it is mentioned for the purposes of residence of the President of Ireland and the assembly of the Houses of the Oireachtas - both of which must be "in or near the City of Dublin"

Five cities trace their city status to historic royal charters, Cork, Dublin, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford all but Kilkenny have a city council and city limits that separate them from their surrounding county or counties. In addition, Galway was granted a charter in 1484 that, while not using the word 'city', did grant it authority to elect a mayor. 



1 These dates are used as approximations of the date that the city came to be viewed as a city. Prior to 1171, and the advent of English rule in Ireland, cities were not declared such officially, in the form of a charter or otherwise (the equivalent cities in England being those said to have been cities 'since time immemorial'). Foundation dates for these pre-Norman cities date from the earliest, continuous Viking occupation . Otherwise the charter date is given.

7 "In November 1395, Richard II granted the town a new a perpetual murage charter and the town's first Royal Charter, raising (its) status to that of Royal Borough"

8 Galway traces its city status to its 1484 Borough Charter of Richard III, in which it was awarded a mayor. However, the text refers to it being a town rather than a city.

The Whangamomona () township was established in 1895 and is located on the State Highway 43 (Lost World Highway) between Taumarunui and Stratford, and on the picturesque Taumarunui - Stratford Railway line, in New Zealand.

In 1989, in response to the re-drawing of administrative boundaries that would have officially moved the township from the Taranaki Region into the Manawatu-Wanganui Region, Whangamomona declared itself as the "Republic of Whangamomona". Though the move was nothing more than a protest, and a not particularly serious one at that, the town holds a celebratory Republic Day once a year on January 15, on which it picks a new president. The day has become something of a local festival day, and now attracts visitors from throughout the North Island. Once, a goat was even elected president of Whangamomona.

Roy Patrick Kerr (born 1934) is a New Zealand born mathematician who is best known for discovering the famous Kerr vacuum, an exact solution to the Einstein field equation of general relativity, which models the gravitational field outside an uncharged rotating massive object, or even a rotating black hole.

Kerr's mathematical talent was first recognized while he was still a high school student at St Andrew's College, Christchurch. He went on to earn his M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Canterbury University College of the University of New Zealand, the precursor to the University of Canterbury, in 1953.  Kerr then moved to the University of Cambridge, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1960.  His dissertation concerned the difficult problem of the equations of motion in general relativity.

After a stint as a postdoctoral student at the Syracuse University in Syracuse, he spent some time working for the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on a bizarre (and soon aborted) anti-gravity project.  In 1962, he moved to the University of Texas at Austin, where in 1963, he discovered his famous exact vacuum solution.  By his own admission, Kerr himself did not realize for some time the importance of this discovery (as the title of his paper suggests).  In 1965, with Alfred Schild, he introduced the Kerr-Schild spacetimes.  During his time in Texas, Kerr supervised four Ph.D. students of his own, despite being (as he puts it), a "party animal".

In 1971, Kerr returned to the University of Canterbury, where he remained until his retirement in 1993.  Kerr retired from his position as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Canterbury in 1993 after having been there for twenty-two years, including ten years as the head of the Mathematics department.

The M ori Television Service is a state sector organisation in New Zealand that was established on May 7 2003 under the M ori Television Service (Te Aratuku Whak ta Irirangi M ori) Act 2003 to replace the Te Reo M ori Television Trust (Te Awhiorangi). The service's  function under Section 8 of the Act is to 'promote te reo M ori me nga tikanga M ori through the provision of a high quality, cost-effective M ori television service, in both M ori and English, that informs, educates, and entertains a broad viewing audience, and, in doing so, enriches New Zealand's society, culture, and heritage.'

M ori Television is available on the UHF band to approximately four-fifths of M ori speakers, and to all of New Zealand via SKY Television's satellite service.  It will also be available on the upcoming FreeView.

Like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the television service has, according to the State Services Commission, an unusual status in that it is 'a stand alone agency within the State sector that does not fall under any State sector category'.

BMW M GmbH (previously: BMW Motorsport GmbH) is a subsidiary of German car manufacturer BMW AG established in May 1972 with just eight employees.  BMW M, also known as M-Technik or just "M" (for Motorsport) was initially created to facilitate BMW s racing program, which was very successful in the 1960s and 1970s.  The first racing project was BMW s 3.0 CSL; in the late 1970s the first modified street legal road cars were produced for the contracted racecar drivers as their personal vehicles. By 1988, the amount of employees had risen to 400.

BMW M: Modified street-cars for the public.


After the success of BMW M in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for sale to the public.  The very first M badged car for sale to the public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978.  The M1, however, was more of a racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver.  The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW s popular 5-Series mid-size sedan.  Since 1978 BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every car on BMW s production line, excluding the 7 Series and X Series sport utility vehicles.  To this day BMW M continues to serve up some of the most highly tuned street-cars available in full production.  BMW M offers modified engines, suspension, interior trim, aerodynamics and exterior styling.  The objective of BMW M is to sell factory production sports cars that are comfortable enough for everyday use while offering uncompromised driving satisfaction and performance.

Competition.
Auto tuning has become a worldwide market providing mild to exotic modifications. Many aftermarket companies have been formed that will modify your car, independent of the manufacturers control. Alpina, Dinan Cars, AC Schnitzer and Hartge are other companies who rival BMW M, taking new cars for modification and having "semi-official" status with BMW regarding warranties, etc. DaimlerChrysler is one of BMW's top competitors, and offers a similar motorsports division to their customers known as AMG. AMG, like BMW M, is an in-house tuning company that has a direct relationship within the parent company. Also, Audi AG offers similar packages on its cars, which bear an "S" badge (such as the S4, S6, and S8). However, Audi's modifications are considered more of an optional package than a special construction by an historically significant counterpart. Also, BMW M supplied the the 6.1 liter V-12 engine that powers the McLaren F1, which, like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the first year of competition for the GTR racing variant.

 M-Cars vs. M-badged cars.
There are several BMW models to which BMW Motorsport made changes without being full M-Cars. Vehicles which have been modified by BMW Motorsport but are not full M-Cars may feature plain 'M' badges with no number, whilst full M-Cars have 'M' badges with the model number. E.g. 'M3' or 'M5'.  It should be noted however that the Z3/Z4-based M Roadster and M Coupe bore numberless 'M' badges as standard fitment.

For example, the E28 M535i featured suspension, styling, and transmission improvements over the standard 535i. These changes were carried out by BMW Motorsport, thus the car carried 'M' stripe badges on the front grille and boot, but not the full 'M5' badging. The E28 M5 was sold along side the M535i. Motorsport modifications have been made to almost every BMW model, hence it is not unusual to see 'standard' BMW's with 'M' badges.

The opposite occurred with the 850CSi where it was an M car in all but its name (it had BMW M sourced engine and it's VIN indicated that it was developed by BMW Motorsport, like all other M cars), this was possibly because a true M8 was in development. This M8 however was cancelled for reasons known only to BMW.

The Rose, the Violet, and the Butterfly is a ballet Divertissement in 1 Act, with choreography by Marius Petipa, and music by Grand Duke Peter II of Oldenburg (AKA Prince Oldenburg). Libretto by Jules Perrot.

First presented by the Imperial Ballet on October 8/20 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1857, for the Imperial court at the theatre of Tsarskoe Selo, St. Petersburg, Russia. A second premiere was given by the Imperial Ballet on October 20/November 1, 1857 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Principal Dancers - Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa, Marfa Muravieva, and Matil'da Madaeva.

Notes.
When this ballet was given it's second premiere at the St. Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre October 20/November 1, 1857, the choreography was incorrectly credited to the Balletmaster Jules Perrot in the theatre program.

A Pas de Deux from this ballet was interpolated by Petipa for the Ballerina Lyubov Radina into his and Perrot's 1856 revival of Le Corsaire, in which it was titled the Pas d'Esclave. The peice has remained a part of the performance tradition of Le Corsaire to the present day.

<doc id="400047" title="Acclimatization" nonfiltered="138" processed="136" dbindex="1500140">

Acclimatization is the process of an organism adjusting to changes in its environment, often involving temperature or climate. Acclimatization usually occurs in a short time, and within one organism's lifetime (compare adaptation). This may be a discrete occurrence or may instead represent part of a periodic cycle, such as a mammal shedding heavy winter fur in favor of a lighter summer coat. Where acclimatization occurs naturally, some authors have used acclimation to describe the process of an organism being forced to adjust to changes in their environment by artificial means, such as in a laboratory setting.

Plants.
Many plants, such as maple trees, irises, and tomatoes, can survive freezing temperatures if the temperature gradually drops lower and lower each night over a period of days or weeks. The same drop might kill them if it occurred suddenly. This process is called hardening and involves several changes, such as a decrease in the water content and an increase in the sugar content of the plant, lowering the freezing point of sap.

Animals.
Animals acclimatize in many ways. Sheep grow very thick wool in cold, damp  climates. Fish are able to adjust only gradually to changes in water temperature and quality. Tropical fish sold at pet stores are often kept in acclimation bags until this process is complete.

Humans.
When humans move from a cool or temperate environment to a hot, dry desert environment or vice versa, they should spend up to seven days acclimatizing to the change in their environment. This lets the body make internal adjustments (see homeostasis) to compensate for the change in environment conditions. If the acclimatization process is ignored, then the person is at higher risk for heat related injuries (heat stroke, heat cramp, pneumonia). 

Acclimatization to high altitude continues for months or even years after initial ascent, and ultimately enables humans to survive in an environment that, without acclimatization, would kill them. Humans who migrate permanently to a higher altitude naturally acclimatize to their new environment by developing an increase in the number of red blood cells to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, in order to compensate for lower levels of oxygen in the air.

<doc id="239452" title="Jodeci" nonfiltered="139" processed="137" dbindex="1500141">


Jodeci was an American musical group, active from 1990 to 1996, whose repertoire included R&B, soul music, and new jack swing. The group consisted of two pairs of brothers from Charlotte, North Carolina: the DeGrates (Donald "DeVante Swing" DeGrate, the group founder/leader, and Dalvin DeGrate) and the Haileys (main lead singer Cedric "K-Ci" Hailey and second lead singer Joel "Jo-Jo" Hailey). The group's name is a combination of the names of its members: Jo-Jo, DeGrate and K-Ci.

Jodeci, also known as the "Bad Boys of R&B", is noted for being a significant influence on many of the R&B group that came after them, particularly Dru Hill and Jagged Edge. In addition, Jodeci was the starting point for the careers of artists such as Missy Elliott, Timbaland, and Ginuwine. The group had a successful string of hit singles and platinum albums until the group went on indefinite hiatus after 1996. The Hailey brothers continued to perform together under the name K-Ci and Jo-Jo, and had success on the pop charts beyond that of the original band.

Influences and followers.
Most of the elements that were eventually combined to form what became known as the "Jodeci style" originated with the work of new jack swing pioneers Keith Sweat and Teddy Riley, with an important influence being the work of Riley's three-man group Guy. Other influences which, while less obvious, were instrumental to their style, included the works of Bobby Womack, Stevie Wonder, The Temptations, Bobby Brown, and New Edition. Sean "Puffy" Combs was in charge of developing Jodeci into a successful act, and had a major role in defining their style and sound.

While Boyz II Men is more of an influence to boy bands such as The Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, Jodeci was more influential to most of the black R&B groups who succeeded them, including Jagged Edge, 112, Next, and Dru Hill. In fact, Dru Hill, with their "bad boy" style image and K-Ci-esque lead vocals from Sisqó, were accused of completely ripping off Jodeci's style.

The acts most heavily influenced by Jodeci were those that they directly trained and developed, including Mary J. Blige and a number of the members of their Swing Mob collective: Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Magoo, Ginuwine, Playa, Tweet, and Darryl Pearson. 

The R&B group II D Extreme ( Cry No More) got a demo deal which led them to getting signed  was in part responsible by DeVante, who was a friend of band member D'Extra Wiley. While hanging out in a hotel after a Jodeci show in Washington D.C.,  D'Extra asked DeVante' to check out his new group, outfitted with Johnny Gill's brother Randy. That impromptu audition led them to Devante's Consultants and business partners who owned Savage records, and imprint on RCA records, then to Gasoline Alley/MCA records.

History.
The Haileys meet the DeGrates.
Both from a Pentecostal background, the Haileys and DeGrates originally performed and recorded independently released gospel albums separately during the late-1980s, and eventually met each other through their girlfriends. However, it turned out that Dalvin DeGrate was dating K-Ci Hailey's girlfriend.His girlfriend was going with both of them. The Hailey brothers and DeVante eventually became friends and discussed possibly making albums together.

Signing to Uptown Records.
DeVante traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota when he was sixteen to audition for Prince's band, but was turned down. He then returned to Charlotte, North Carolina to record a song JoJo was performing. Soon, the two went to New York City to shop their demo tapes in hopes of getting signed. K-Ci and Dalvin both decided to tag along, and joined their respective brothers for the trip. Eventually, hip hop artist and record producer Heavy D heard one of the tapes and loved it. He talked Uptown Records CEO Andre Harrell into listening to the tape, who was impressed enough to sign the group.

The group was assigned to Uptown executive Sean "Puffy" Combs, who took on the task of developing the new act. He helped the group create its rough hip-hop-based image, reminiscent of that of Teddy Riley's group Guy. Jodeci were exposed to the public by singing background vocals on a number of singles by Father MC. K-Ci also contributed background vocals (alongside Uptown labelmates Terri Robinson and Tabitha Brace) on some tracks for Ralph Tresvant and Jasmine Guy's solo debut albums. Jodeci made their television debut on the June 11 1991 episode of Soul Train (and had their official first interview on BET's Video Soul a few months earlier before they appeared on Soul Train).

Early success.
On May 28, 1991, Jodeci released their debut album, Forever My Lady, which included the singles "Gotta Love", "Forever My Lady", "Stay", "Come and Talk To Me", and "I'm Still Waiting". Three of these singles hit #1 on the R&B charts and the album sold over three million copies.

On most of the tracks on Forever My Lady and subsequent releases by the group, K-Ci and Jo-Jo share lead vocals, and all four members contribute backgrounds. DeVante and Uptown labelmate Al B. Sure! produced the album, while DeVante wrote every song with help from K-Ci on "Gotta Love" and Al B. Sure! on the title track.  K-Ci and Jo-Jo also worked with Al B. as background vocalists when Al B. and Kyle West prodcued a few tracks on Tevin Campbell's T.E.V.I.N., his debut LP.  Devante even co-produced some songs on Al B.'s Sexy Versus album in 1992.

On February 6 1993, Jodeci, along with Uptown labelmates Father MC, Heavy D, Mary J. Blige, and Christopher Williams, recorded the "Uptown Unplugged" episode of MTV Unplugged, which aired on MTV on May 31, 1993. After performing live versions of "Forever My Lady," "Come & Talk to Me" and "Stay," the group closed their session with a cover of Stevie Wonder's 1980 single "Lately". The song became their first and only Top 5 pop hit.

During this same year, a woman filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against K-Ci and DeVante. She had met K-Ci at a nightclub, and went home with him, where allegedly DeVante pointed a gun at her while K-Ci fondled her breasts.

As it came time to release the second Jodeci album, there was dispute between Uptown and the band, who felt they were being treated unfairly by the label. Diary of a Mad Band was finally released on December 21 1993, with very little initial promotional backing from the label, but eventually went platinum. The album spawned such hits as "Feenin'" and the #1 R&B hit "Cry For You"; the video for the latter was directed by a then-relatively unknown Sean "Puffy" Combs.  It was around this time that Death Row Records CEO, Suge Knight approached the group and signed them to Suge Management as a part time manager and consultant. 



Expansion and collaborations.
By 1992, the success of the first album allowed DeVante to found the Swing Mob, a collective of artists, songwriters, and producers who were signed to Elektra Records through his "Swing Mob" imprint. A number of the members formed Jodeci's touring band, including guitarist Darryl Pearson. All of the twenty-plus members of Swing Mob lived in a single two-story house in New York City, and often did songwriting, production, and guest vocal work on Jodeci records.

Many of the artists signed to Swing Mob were Jodeci fans who auditioned for DeVante backstage before or after Jodeci concerts, including the female quartet Sista. Among the members of Sista was a young singer/rapper named Missy Elliott; she brought her friends Tim "DJ Timmy Tim" Mosley and Melvin "Magoo" Barcliff along with her when she and Sista moved to New York after getting signed to Swing Mob. DeVante liked Mosely's unusual production style, and, dubbing him "Timbaland", began working with the young producer on material for Jodeci, Sista, Playa, and Swing Mob members Elgin "Ginuwine" Lumpkin and Sugah, another female quartet that included Tweet. Playa was discovered in 1991 by Devante, backstage, during a Jodeci show in Louisville. He was so impressed by Smoke () & Black singing a capella that he came back in 1994 to sign them. They worked a lot with Devante and contributed to the special "Jodeci vocal harmonies"..

The Swing Mob members recorded dozens of records, including an entire Sista LP, chiefly written by Missy and produced by DeVante and Timbaland. 4 All The Sistas Around Da World was scheduled for a 1994 released, but was shelved.  However, the album had moderate success with the hit "Brand New".

Other frequent Jodeci collaborators during this period included K-Ci's then-girlfriend Mary J. Blige and hip-hop artist Tupac Shakur, for whom DeVante produced a number of tracks.



Third album and hiatus.
In 1994, DeVante was robbed of over $160,000 in jewelry, clothes, and other items by two thugs who pointed guns at his head.

On July 18, 1995, Jodeci released their third and to date, final album, The Show, The After Party, The Hotel. The album was another step forward in terms of DeVante's production and the group's songwriting skills, assisted on some tracks by Missy Elliott, Timbaland and r'n'b group from Louisville PLAYA (Static, Smoke, Black). A number of hit singles were launched from this record, including "Love U 4 Life", "Get On Up", and the Top 20 hit "Freek'n You", a remix of which featured Ghostface Killah and Raekwon. 

For all of its success, The Show, The After Party, The Hotel proved to be the last album the group would release. K-Ci and Jo-Jo performed guest vocals on Tupac's 1996 single "How Do U Want It", and were anxious to begin a side project.  K-Ci and Jo-Jo, alongside Aaron Hall, did "Toss It Up" on Pac's Makaveli album.  Jodeci went on an indefinite hiatus in 1996, with the Haileys forming the more pop-flavored vocal group K-Ci and JoJo, scoring hits such as "All My Life", "Tell Me It's Real", and "Crazy" (from the Save The Last Dance soundtrack). DeVante's Swing Mob folded the same year, and most of its members went on to find success at other labels (PLAYA on Def Jam with the album "Cheers 2 u" in 1998). Dalvin released a solo album, Met-a-mor-phic, in 2000, and became a writer and producer for artists such as Tevin Campbell.

Uptown Records folded at about the same time Jodeci did, and was absorbed into MCA Records; the band is now signed to Geffen Records. A new Jodeci album has been in the pipeline for nearly a decade, and although the members have reunited at various times and recorded material, the only new Jodeci song released after 1996 was "Slip and Fall", which appeared as a limited-edition track on K-Ci and JoJo's third album, X.

On June 7, 2005, Jodeci's first greatest hits album, Back to the Future: The Very Best of Jodeci, was released.  It debuted at #6 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and at #27 on the Billboard 200. The original compilation was to include the song "That Thang", which featured rap artists Trick Daddy and Trina. The song was replaced with "Good Luv", due to Atlantic Records having ownership of "That Thang". The album struck Gold certification come the year's end. Jodeci (minus Devante Swing) appeared on radio station The Beat in Los Angeles for a rare radio interview.  During their interview, they mentioned they were currently filming a reality television show. 

After 10 years, the band came back together for a song during the beginning of 2005. The 4 members passed into DJ Quik studio while he was playing his "Quik's Groove 7". The boys liked it and wanted to sing on it. The song was released under the title of "Quikstrumental (Quik's Groove 7)" on DJ Quik's album Trauma on Sept. 13th 2005.

In a March 2006 interview with United Kingdom R&B DJ Trevor Nelson, Jodeci spoke of a comeback album, as well as a look into the past and future of the famous band.

Shiru (Hebrew script:     , English translation: "Sing") was the Israeli entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993, performed in Hebrew and English. by Sarah'le Sharon & The Shiru Group.

The song is about the power of song itself, which is said to be "all we have". The bridge of the song is performed in English, marking the first occasion on which the Israeli Contest entry had featured any language apart from Hebrew.

The song was performed twenty-fourth on the night (following Cyprus' Kyriakos Zimboulakis and Dimos van Beke with Mi Stamatas and preceding Norway's Silje Vige with Alle Mine Tankar). At the close of voting, it had received 4 points, placing 24th in a field of 25 - Israel's worst finish at the time.

Due to the rapidly-expanding Contest, entry to the 1994 Contest was restricted to the 18 top entrants at the 1993 edition, a group which did not include Israel. As the country broadcast the Contest live (making them a "passive participant"), they were re-admitted to the fold the next year. Thus, the song was succeeded as Israeli representative at the 1995 Contest by Liora with Amen.

Films.
1998   Janmadinam (The Birthday) - Malayalam .
Sarasu has come to the hospital to deliver her baby. Amma, her mother, is with her, to assist her. The actual time-span of the film is a single night which the mother and the daughter spend at the hospital. Sarasu, a TV-reporter working in Bombay, keeps a diary into which she pours her inner-most feelings. We find out that Sarasu was forced by her father to marry Raghu, although she was in love with Ajay, a cameraman. A few months after her marriage, she passes through Bombay to join her husband. On the way, she meets Ajay in his flat. This is during the '1993 communal violence in Bombay. In the aftermath of this meeting, Sarasu is finally forced to make a choice. And Amma realizes that she also has to take a stand, as a result of Sarasu's choice. It is this unspoken, unseen, subtle tension between mother and daughter, and a slow psychological unfolding of the personal histories of the main characters, which form the content of this film.

He embarked on his current path in 1963 when he was issued a 3 year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut for refusing military induction. It was while serving his sentence as Inmate No. 21341 that he became associated with another famous activist, Howard Zinn. He wrote to Zinn, who wrote back, sending him books on civil liberties and American politics. 

Irons would go on to complete his doctorate at Boston University in 1973. Aftewards, Dr. Zinn helped arrange for Irons to work at a law firm defending Daniel Ellsberg, who was under federal prosecution at the time for stealing the Pentagon Papers.  His work at the law firm would later serve as motivation for him to pursue a law degree from Harvard Law School. 

Upon graduating, he taught at Boston College Law School and the University of Massachusetts before moving to the University of California at San Diego in 1982 where he would establish the Earl Warren Bill of Rights Project, of which he is the director. In addition to teaching and authoring several books, he has also helped reopen the wartime internment cases of Fred Korematsu, Min Yasui, and Gordon Hirabayashi.

 "One More Minute"   4:02;
 "Midnight Star"   4:33;

The promo single only contains "One More Minute." 

Music video.
Several jokes in the music video are inspired by a scene in the movie Top Secret!, a movie Yankovic cites as one of his favorites. Most notable are the microphone gags and the presence of three back-up singers, played in the music video by Yankovic's band. Additionally, in concert, while performing this song, Yankovic removes a pair of boxers from his pants and hands them to a female in the audience, which is also inspired by that scene.

A honbasho (   ) is the term given to any of the six official professional sumo tournaments held each year.  Only honbasho results matter in determining promotion and demotions for sumo wrestlers (or rikishi).  

A literal translation of honbasho is "main (or real) tournament". This term is used to distinguish these tournments from display basho which are held a part of sumo tours, between the six major tournaments.  Such display tournaments may have prize money attached but a wrestler's performance will not have any effect on their ranking.  This type of sumo is often called hana-sumo (lit. flower-sumo) as it is not taken as seriously by the wrestlers.

Honbasho last for 15 days. Sumo wrestlers ranked in the top two divisions (makuuchi and juryo) wrestle once each day, while those of the lower divisions wrestle seven times, approximately once every alternate day. The first aim for most wrestlers is to achieve kachikoshi, or a majority of wins, and thus ensure a promotion for the next honbasho tournament. In addition for each division there is a championship prize for the wrestler with the most wins at the end. A playoff on the final day is used to decide the winner in case of a tie.

A hypobaric chamber, or altitude chamber, is a chamber used during aerospace or high terrestrial altitude research or training to simulate the effects of high altitude on the human body, especially hypoxia (low oxygen) and hypobaria (low ambient air pressure). Some chambers also control for temperature and relative humidity.

 Procedure .
One or more subjects (usually, pilots or crew members, though anyone interested in the effects of high altitude can usually arrange a visit) are placed in the chamber.  Before "ascending" to the desired altitude, subjects pre-breathe oxygen from oxygen masks to purge nitrogen from their bloodstream so decompression sickness (DCS) does not occur. With masks in place, the atmospheric pressure inside the chamber is then reduced to simulate altitudes of up to tens of thousands of feet.  The subjects then remove their oxygen masks and experience the symptoms of hypoxia. An inside safety observer, breathing oxygen by mask, should always be present to place a subject's mask back on in the event a subject passes out unconscious. Outside observers monitor the subjects' condition via closed circuit television and viewing ports.

While the mask is off, subjects may be asked to do trivial tasks, such as arithmetic and signing their own name.  When such tasks start taking excessive lengths of time to be done or are done poorly, it is usually a sign that the "Time of Useful Consciousness" has been exceeded and that the mask should be replaced.  Subjects may also insure that they are able to do tasks such as clear their nose and sinuses easily, as pain from such problems can be a major distraction in an emergency such as rapid decompression.

Use in Research.



 Use in Training .
The primary purpose of the altitude chamber is for the subjects to determine what their hypoxia symptoms are. The symptoms of hypoxia are different for each individual, and this training is helpful for aviators to be able to recognize these symptoms during actual flight so as to avoid in-flight oxygen emergencies. Pilots who fly aircraft at altitudes in excess of 10 thousand feet must use oxygen equipment. Altitude chamber training is required of U.S. military aviators every five years.  The FAA and some larger airlines also require their pilots to periodically take altitude chamber training.  Anyone with a pilot certificate in the United States who has a current Class I or Class II medical certificate can normally sign up and receive altitude training from the government.

<doc id="295228" title="Cholo" nonfiltered="153" processed="151" dbindex="1500156">
Cholo is an alternate name for the Emberá languages.  For the 1986 video game, see Cholo (computer game).;

Cholo is an English- and Spanish-language word which, broadly, is applied to persons of mixed Amerindian and Spanish ancestry. However, its precise usage has varied widely in different times and places.  It is used in the masculine and neuter; the feminine form in Spanish (and sometimes in English) is chola.  

Origin and history.

The term is used in a book, Los comentarios reales del Inca Garcilazo de la Vega (a writer from Peru, published in 1609 and 1616). He writes (in Spanish) "Cholo is a word from the Windward Islands; it means dog, not of the purebred variety . . . . the Spaniards use it for insult and vituperation."

In Colonial Mexico, the terms cholo and coyote co-existed, indicating mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry, or a poor background, or both.

Cholo as an English-language term dates at least to the early 1900s. Isela Alexsandra Garcia of the University of California at Berkeley writes that the term can be traced to Mexico, where in the early part of the last century it referred to "culturally marginal" mestizos, or people of mixed Spanish and native American origin. She cites James Diego Vigil s Barrio Gangs: Street Life and Identity in Southern California as a source.

An article in the Los Angeles Express of April 2, 1907, headlined "Cleaning Up the Filthy Cholo Courts Has Begun in Earnest," uses the terms cholos and Mexicans interchangeably.  The term cholo courts was defined in The Journal of San Diego History as "sometimes little more than instant slums as shanties were strewn almost randomly around city lots in order to create cheap horizontal tenements."  The term in these articles indicates that it means simply poor Mexicans.

The term has two somewhat different meanings, one in the United States, Canada and Mexico and another in the rest of the Americas.

In modern times, unattested references on the Internet, often copied word for word from one site to another, have stated essentially as follows:

Mexico and north.


In Mexico and north, Cholo is a term implying a typically Mexican mestizo gangster. A cholo is stereotypically depicted as wearing baggy chinos (khaki pants) or khaki shorts with white knee-high socks, so-called wifebeater undershirts, flannel shirts buttoned all the way to the top or unbuttoned except for the top button, and a shaved head or slicked-back hair. Popular "cholo" brands include Dickies and Ben Davis.  This same designation may also be associated with black ink tattoos, commonly involving gang calligraphy, or family names and art.  A cholo might also stereotypically own a lowrider, prefer music like Zapp and Roger's "More Bounce To The Ounce" and "Doo Wa Ditty." He might also employ the Chicano term of ese in a way to call someone dude, like "What's up, ese?" or "¡Órale, ese!". This word in Spanish means that one or that guy, but it also is the letter S, which some have said stands for Sureño, a member of a certain street gang. Another term with essentially the same meaning is Vato, which can be used in the same way. 

It is this particular image that Cheech Marin drew on in the Cheech and Chong films. There is also a reference to "the cholo" in Assault on Precinct 13. In the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite, Nano and Arturo De Silva play characters simply referred to as "Cholo No. 1" and "Cholo No. 2". In the videogame Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, there is a street gang called the Cholos who resemble the stereotypical gangster image of a Cholo. The usage was reportedly more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s than today, though the usage  was still fairly widespread in some areas in the 1990s.

In South Texas, cholos are sometimes referred to as chongers.

In the English-speaking world of the United States, the word is most primarily and heavily used in Caló slang, but it in turn has infiltrated into mainstream American English use. Most specifically, the term "cholo" when used in American English is likely to be done so by people associated with American youth movements such as the Chicano/Mexican-American/white & black lowrider subcultures, African-American gangsters of the Western United States, or the hip hop scene in general.
Racial and cultural status, along with social class are reflected in the term cholo itself, which was adopted in California in the 1960s by youth following the pachuco tradition, as a label for that identity (Cuellar 1982). In 1571, Fray Alonso de Molina, in his Nahuatl vocabulary (Vocabulario en Lengua Castellana y Mexicana Y Mexicana y Castellana), defined the word xolo as slave, servant, or waiter. The Porrúa Dictionary defines cholo, as used in the Americas, as a civilized Indian or a half-breed or mestizo of a European father and Indian mother. The word has historically been used along the borderland as a derogatory term to mean lower class Mexican migrants, and in the rest of Latin America to mean an acculturating Indian or peasant (Cuellar 1982:3). 

To explain the stigma accruing to the Indian component of the term "cholo," it is useful to look at another word containing assessments of racial and cultural identity: indio, the Spanish word for Indian, which in Mexico conveys two principal images. First, there is the image of Indian identity communicated in nationalist discourse taught to children in elementary school about "the brave and noble Indian Heritage" of Mexicans. However, another definition seems more pervasive on an every-day basis in popular discourse, and that is the use of the term "indio" as a common insult to mean dumb, uncivilized, or unsophisticated. This is also implied in widely-used popular phrases such as "acaba de bajar del cerro" (someone who just came down out of the hills), or "trae el nopal en la frente" (the image of a person with a prickly pear cactus on his or her forehead). The cactus, of course, is one of the elements in the symbol of the Aztecs and appears in the national seal on the Mexican flag. These phrases ostensibly refer to Mexican identity, but do not appear to be used to refer to persons of primarily European descent and cultural background. Rather they refer to the peasant population of the ranchos. 

Despite, or because of, its long history of denigrating semantics, the term cholo was turned on its head and used as a symbol of pride in the context of the ethnic power movements of the 1960s (Cummings 2004).

South of Mexico.


Under the Caste System of colonial Latin America, the term Cholo originally applied to the children resulting from the union of a Mestizo and an Amerindian; that is, someone of three quarters Amerindian and one quarter Spanish ancestry. More precisely, the term was specific to the Viceroyalty of Peru and neighbouring Andean regions of South America. In El Salvador, the word cholo means big, large (grande).

During the colonial era a myriad of other terms (mestizo, castizo, chamizo, etc.) were in use to denote other individuals of European/Amerindian ancestry in ratios smaller or greater of Spanish-to-Amerindian ancestry. The term is most commonly associated with Peru and Bolivia.

Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
In modern-day Peru and Bolivia, cholo is still a widely used term which refers to people with noticeably greater amounts of Amerindian than European ancestry. Among Peruvians, the term mestizo (which in other Latin American countries is usually used for those of relatively equal amounts of Spanish to Amerindian ancestry) has also become increasingly common.

In recent years, the meaning of cholo has further shifted to include a vast number of people of exclusively Native American ancestry. In this latter context, the term often implies indigenous people who have attained a higher social status by moving from the rural or interior regions of the country to the urban areas and cities, have taken up western (Hispanic/mestizo) cultural practices, are bilingual (fluent in both Spanish and an Amerindian language) but deny any knowledge of a native language, downplay their native descendance and identify solely with their newly adopted cultural norms.  In that latter context, the usage is somewhat pejorative.

During his winning presidential campaign, the former president of Peru, Alejandro Toledo, successfully reached out to the largest segment of the Peruvian population   45 percent of which is composed of indigenous Peruvians in addition to the cholos   by proclaiming his indigenous heritage and identifying himself as a Cholo. Spanish-language media played on this title, and referred to him as El Cholo throughout the campaign and in the initial stages of his presidency.

In Ecuador, "Cholo" is also used to denote a greater affinity for Amerindian than Spanish heritage for mixed-race people. Unlike the way in which the term is used in other countries, the affinity is cultural, not one based on a person's looks.

Cholos in Ecuador reside typically in communities whose members are actually mestizos whose ancestry is both Spanish and Amerindian   often greater Spanish than Amerindian. Yet apart from their apparent Spanish descent and monolingualism in Spanish, their garb, culture and customs, their traditional occupations and many times their surnames are more typical of highland Quichua Amerindians than of Spaniards. This circumstance is in contrast to the evolution of mestizo identity and life throughout the rest of Latin America, where the emphasis has always been placed solely on the Spanish side. 

A widely known example of the former are the "Cholas Cuencanas", from the colonial city of Cuenca in the southern region of that country.

When not specifically referring to the above-mentioned mestizo communities, the term cholo may also have the same connotations of greater Amerindian ancestry than Spanish of a mixed-race person as it does in other Andean countries.

The term as used in Ecuador is used as a supposedly neutral term to designate the group described above.  It is used, however, as a pejorative term to generalize someone who is "low class," a designation usually reserved for those of greater Amerindian admixture.

Chile and Argentina.
In Chile and Argentina cholo also at times may connote a person of unmixed Amerindian ancestry or predominantly Amerindian appearance.

In Chile the term is used almost exclusively to refer to Peruvians and Bolivians. It is usually intended as an insult. It may also be applied to anyone of unmixed Amerindian ancestry or predominantly Amerindian appearance, except if the person is a fellow Chilean.

Cholo and Chola are also commonly used as nicknames, not only for those who would be considered cholos. It is not considered a negative epithet and may be known or used only as a nickname, such as the case of Argentine football (soccer) player Cholo Simeone.

David Steeves (1934-1965), was a U.S. Air Force lieutenant in the 1950s who was unjustly accused of giving a Lockheed T-33A trainer jet to the USSR during the Cold War.

Lieutenant Steeves was ordered to fly the jet from Hamilton Air Force Base near San Francisco, California to Craig Air Force Base near Selma, Alabama in May 1957.  Steeves and the jet disappeared, and was declared dead after a search turned up nothing.  However, Steeves appeared out of the Sierra Nevada the following July, saying he parachuted after something blew up in the jet.

When the Air Force could not find any wreckage, Steeves was accused of giving the jet to Russia.  Even though no charges were brought against the lieutenant, he requested discharge from the Air Force, which was granted.

After returning to civilian life, Steeves found work flying experimental models of new aircraft, and designing his own craft.  In 1965, Steeves was killed in a demonstration flight of a new aircraft.

In 1977, while some Boy Scouts were on a hiking trip in Kings Canyon National Park, they came across a cockpit cover.  The serial number on it matched the missing T-33A jet that Steeves had piloted.

Cassiopeia (IPA: ) is a northern constellation which Greek mythology considered to represent a vain queen who boasted about her unrivaled beauty. It is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 listed by Ptolemy.

Notable features.
Cassiopeia contains two stars visible to the naked eye that rank among the most luminous in the galaxy:  Cas and V509 Cas. The star Cas is a nearby (19.4 ly) binary star comprising of a yellow Sun-like dwarf and an orange dwarf star.

If we were to observe Earth's Sun from Alpha Centauri, it would appear to be in Cassiopeia as a yellow-white 0.5 magnitude star. The famous "W" of Cassiopeia would become a zig-zag pattern with the Sun at the leftmost end, closest to Cas.
Cassiopeia looks like a W or a crown.

Notable deep sky objects.
Two Messier objects, Messier 52 (NGC 7654) and Messier 103 (NGC 581) are located in Cassiopeia. Both are open clusters and being 7th magnitude objects they are easy targets with binoculars.

Robert Albert Bloch (April 5 1917, Chicago-September 23 1994, Los Angeles) was a prolific American writer. He was the son of Raphael "Ray" Bloch (1884, Chicago-1952, Chicago), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880, Attica, Indiana-1944, Milwaukee, WI), a social worker, both of German-Jewish descent.

Bloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over twenty novels, usually crime fiction, science fiction, and, perhaps most influentially, horror fiction (Psycho). He was one of the youngest members of the Lovecraft Circle; Lovecraft was Bloch's mentor and one of the first to seriously encourage his talent.

He was a contributor to pulp magazines like Weird Tales in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter. He was the recipient of the Hugo Award (for his story "That Hell-Bound Train"), the Bram Stoker Award, and the World Fantasy Award. He served a term as president of the Mystery Writers of America.

Robert Bloch was also a major contributor to science fiction fanzines and fandom in general.  In the 1940s, he created the humorous character Lefty Feep in a story for Fantastic Adventures. He also worked for a time in vaudeville. He was a good friend of the science fiction writer Stanley G. Weinbaum.

Early writing career.
During the 1930s, Bloch was an avid reader of the pulp magazine Weird Tales. H. P. Lovecraft, a frequent contributor to that magazine, became one of his favorite writers. As a teenager, Bloch befriended and corresponded with Lovecraft, who gave the promising youngster advice on his own fiction-writing efforts. Bloch's first professional sales, at the age of just seventeen, were to Weird Tales with the short stories "The Feast in the Abbey" and "The Secret in the Tomb". Bloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft, and a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts De Vermis Mysteriis  and Cultes des Goules.

The young Bloch even appears, thinly disguised, as the character "Robert Blake" in Lovecraft's story "The Haunter of the Dark", which is dedicated to Bloch. In this story, Lovecraft kills off the Bloch character, repaying a courtesy Bloch paid Lovecraft with his tale "The Shambler from the Stars", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current street address in Milwaukee. (Bloch even had a signed certificate from Lovecraft some of his creations giving Bloch permission to kill Lovecraft off in a story.) Bloch later wrote a third tale, "The Shadow From the Steeple", picking up where "The Haunter of the Dark" finished.

After Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for Weird Tales, where he became one its its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as  the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories. He gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly "Blochian" stories was "Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper", which was published in Weird Tales in 1943. The story was Bloch's take on the Jack the Ripper legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments. Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the Man in the Iron Mask ("Iron Mask", 1944), the Marquis de Sade ("The Skull of the Marquis de Sade", 1945) and Lizzie Borden ("Lizzie Borden Took an Axe...", 1946).

Politics.
In 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for a little-known assistant attorney in Milwaukee, Wisconsin named Carl Zeidler. He was asked to work on his speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, Once Around the Bloch, he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with   for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling shtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point: 

If Carl Zeidler had not asked Jim Doolittle to manage his campaign, Doolittle would never have contacted me about it. And the only reason Doolittle knew me to begin with was because he read my yarn ("The Cloak") in Unknown. ;

Rattling this chain of circumstances, one may stretch it a bit further. If I had not written a little vampire story called "The Cloak", Carl Zeidler might never have become mayor of Milwaukee.

Psycho and screenwriting.
Bloch became most famous as the author of the novel Psycho, which was adapted by Joseph Stefano into the screenplay for the film of the same name, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. His best-known work as a screenwriter is probably The Night Walker (1964), which he wrote for William Castle, although he also penned several scripts for the original series of Star Trek; he seemed happiest, among his television work, with his contributions to the Boris Karloff-hosted series Thriller. 

Bloch also contributed to Harlan Ellison's science fiction anthology, Dangerous Visions. His story, "A Toy for Juliette", evoked both the Marquis de Sade and Jack the Ripper. In fact, Ellison's own contribution to the anthology was a direct follow-up of Bloch's, and was titled "The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World". 

Bloch died in 1994 and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. 

Writings on Bloch.
There is an essay on his work, with particular reference to the novels Psycho and The Scarf, in S. T. Joshi's book The Modern Weird Tale (2001). Joshi examines Bloch's literary relationship with Lovecraft in a further essay in The Evolution of the Weird Tale (2004).

In addition, Randall D. Larson has authored three reference books about Robert Bloch: The Robert Bloch Reader's Guide (1986, a literary analysis of Bloch's entire output through 1986), The Complete Robert Bloch (1986, an illustrated bibliography of Bloch's writing), and The Robert Bloch Companion (1986, collected interviews).

A compilation of Bloch's Cthulhu Mythos fiction, titled Mysteries of the Worm, was published by Chaosium with commentary by Robert M. Price.

Canadian Forces Base Summerside (CFB Summerside) was an air force base located in St. Eleanors, Prince Edward Island, Canada, now part of the city of Summerside.

RCAF Station Summerside.

The airfield was constructed by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) between 1940-1941 and was named RCAF Station Summerside.

It was home to No. 9 Service Flying Training School (SFTS), a flight school that operated under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Relief or emergency airfields were located at nearby RCAF Station Mount Pleasant and Wellington. Airmen were trained on Harvards. In July 1942 No. 9 SFTS moved to RCAF Station Centralia and was replaced by No. 1 General Reconnaissance School (GRS) which flew Ansons. No. 1 GRS was changed to No. 1 Reconnaissance and Navigation School in 1945.

The station was closed in 1946 but reopened in 1947 with the formation of No. 1 Air Navigation School (ANS). This was a NATO training facility. No. 1 ANS left in 1953 and the Central Navigation School was established. In 1949  No. 2 (Maritime) Operational Training Unit started operation. The influx of personnel and their families required the building of more accommodation quarters. In 1949 the base housing was completed and named "Slemon Park" in honour of Air Marshall Roy Slemon.

During the Cold War, the base was home to anti-submarine and coastal patrol aircraft such as the Lancaster B.X, CP-122 Neptune, CP-107 Argus, and CP-121 Tracker. Other aircraft operated from Summerside include the CC-115 Buffalo and CH-113 Labrador. These aircraft were operated by various squadrons and units including No. 2 (Maritime) Operational Training Unit, No. 107 Rescue Unit, 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron, 420 Air Reserve Squadron, 880 Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron (Royal Canadian Navy), 31 Support Air Group (Royal Canadian Navy), and 415 Maritime Patrol Squadron.

CFB Summerside.

The February 1, 1968 unification of the three service branches into the Canadian Armed Forces saw RCAF Station Summerside change its name to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Summerside.

CFB Summerside's chief role in the 1980s was support for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the government department responsible for managing Canada's ocean resources. CP-121 Trackers were used to patrol Georges Bank and the Grand Banks to monitor foreign fishing fleets.

The 1989 federal budget cuts to the Department of National Defence identified CFB Summerside as a candidate for base closure.  In 1991 the base was closed and the majority of military personnel were transferred to CFB Greenwood in Nova Scotia.

Current use.

The entire property including airfield, housing units, hangars and support structures was renamed Slemon Park and was transferred to a local development authority named "Slemon Park Corporation".  Today the site is host to a mix of public and private sector operations, including Holland College, Humpty Dumpty Snack Foods Inc. and several aerospace companies.  Employment at Slemon Park facilities now exceeds pre-1991 levels.

The airfield remains active as the Summerside Airport, serving the western part of the province.  Summerside's main runway is better able to handle large aircraft than the Charlottetown Airport, but there is no scheduled service.

Magnus Norman (born May 30, 1976 in Filipstad) is a retired Swedish professional tennis player.

A former World No. 2 (June 12, 2000), despite being considered average at best by most respected tennis insiders, Norman braved all criticisms and won 12 career singles titles (including a Tennis Masters Series in Rome, Italy), but perhaps is best known for his unique running ability. In 2000, he competed in the men's singles at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia where he was downed in the 3rd round by unheralded Frenchman Arnaud Di Pasquale in straight sets. He was also the runner-up at Roland Garros, losing to three-time champion Gustavo Kuerten (Brazil) in four sets.

Norman underwent corrective surgery for a heart valve condition in 1998.  He unceremoniously retired due to hip and knee injuries in a Press Conference at the 2004 Stockholm Open having not played for the whole year.

<doc id="3620167" title="Battle of Clontibret" nonfiltered="159" processed="157" dbindex="1500162">

The Battle of Clontibret (1595) was fought in modern County Monaghan in Ulster in northern Ireland during the Nine Years War, between the crown forces of Queen Elizabeth and the rebel army of Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone. It ended in victory for Tyrone, and was the first severe set-back suffered by the English during the war.

Background.
The opening campaigns of the Nine Years War centred on English attempts to maintain a string of garrisons along the southern border of the O'Neill's territory in Ulster. The rebel leader promptly besieged the English garrison at Monaghan castle, and Sir Henry Bagenal, commander of the English forces, marched out to its relief on the 25th of May (June 4 New Style) from Dundalk, via Newry. His army was made up of 1,750 troops, including some veterans and certain companies newly arrived from the Spanish campaign in Brittany, but there were many recruits in the ranks. Bagenal's men were predominantly infantry, armed with muskets and pikes; there was also a small number of horsemen raised in the Pale.

The battle.
The Battle of Clontibret was essentially a two day running fight, as Bagenal's column was ambushed on its way to and from Monaghan town.

During the march to the town, the Irish fought sharply along the roads about Crossdall, around 4 miles (6.5 km) from Monaghan, firing on the English column with calivers (light muskets) from the surrounding woodland. However, they did not come to "push of pike" or hand to hand combat. With the loss of 12 dead and 30 wounded the English reached the castle, which was re-supplied and reinforced with one company. Bagenal had misgivings about his supply of powder and lead, much of which had been used on the way, and could afford little enough for the garrison before he started back.

Two days later, on the 27th of May, Bagenal set out for Newry in a column, but by another route, past the townland of Clontibret. The new route lay through Drumlin country, which abounded with hills, bogs and woods, making it ideal for an ambush. The column came under fire from the outset, and then fell into a major ambush at a pass near Clontibret. 

O'Neill's army - about 4000 strong - consisted of contingents from the O'Neill, MacMahon and Maguire clans, as well as Scottish mercenaries. The rebel leader also deployed a greatly enlarged force of cavalry and caliver-men (musketeers). To Bagenal's puzzlement, the caliver-men were turned out in red coats and acquitted themselves with expertise. Fire from the flanks was heavy, and many English troops were killed or fell wounded while the Irish cavalry played around the fringes. 

O'Neill himself was almost killed in hand to hand combat with a Palesman named Seagrave, who led a cavalry charge on the Irish position. Seagrave had his arm chopped off by O'Neill's standard bearer O'Cahan, and was killed by O'Neill with a dagger thrust to the penis. 

Bagenal's column was slowed to a painful crawl and, as night fell in the wilderness, the commander called his men to a halt and camped at the hilltop of Ballymacowen. It seemed that hundreds were missing, and there was tremendous fear that O'Neill would renew the attack under cover of darkness. No further assault was made and, a little after first light, reinforcements from Newry arrived to relieve the column.

Aftermath.
According to intelligence received in the days following, O'Neill's failure to follow up had been caused by a lack of powder - ironic, given the state of Bagenal's own supplies - but the overall sense in government was of disquiet, and a bad job was made of hushing up the casualty figures. This of course gave fuel to the rumours of a severe defeat, and many people set greater store on the numbers put about by rebel supporters.

Sir Ralph Lane, the muster-master-general, informed the queen's principal secretary, Lord Burghley, that "more men were hurt and killed in that late service than was convenient to declare". The casualty figures for both sides vary depending on sources. Bagenal admitted only 31 killed and 109 wounded on the second day of fighting, but his losses were almost certainly higher. The Irish annals claimed up to 700 English killed. Estimates of the rebel losses vary between 100 to 400 killed. 

Three years later, Bagenal led another English force into an ambush of O'Neill's, at the battle of the Yellow Ford. On that occasion, he was killed and his command destroyed.

<doc id="2709616" title="Sodium pertechnetate" nonfiltered="160" processed="158" dbindex="1500163">


Sodium pertechnetate (sodium tetraoxotechnetate (VII)), -, is an ionic salt of sodium and pertechnetate.
99mTcO4- is the basis of a family of radioactive pharmaceuticals approved for diagnostic use.  The advantages to 99mTc include its short half-life of 6 hours, low radiation exposure to the patient, and ability to effectively detect emitted gamma radiation.  The short half-life of 99mTc and the absence of radiation damage to tissues allow a patient to be injected with activities of more than 30 milliCuries.  However, the half-life is long enough that labelling synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical and scintigraphic measurements can be performed without losing much activity.  The energy emitted from 99mTc is 140 keV, which allows for the study of deep body organs.  The pertechnetate ion is primarily used in thyroid imaging because - and iodide, due to similar charge/radius ratio, are similarly incorporated into the thyroid gland.  However, the pertechnetate ion is not incorporated into the thyroglobulin.1            

Chemistry.
-, the only tetrahedral oxoanion of technetium, is the basic starting material for all technetate chemistry.  Pertechnetate salts are usually colorless.9 - is produced by oxidizing technetium with nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide.  The pertechnetate anion is similar to the permanganate anion but is a weaker oxidizing agent.  The standard electrode potential for TcO4-/TcO2 is only +0.738 V in acidic solution, as compared to +1.695 V for MnO4-/MnO2.1   Because of its diminished oxidizing powers, - is stable in alkaline solution. - is more similar to ReO4-.  Depending of the reducing agent, - can be converted to derivatives containing Tc(VI), Tc(V), and Tc(IV).6 In the absence of strong complexing ligands, TcO4- is reduced to a +4 oxidation state via the formation of TcO2 hydrate.1

Pharmaceutical use1.
Radiopharmaceuticals have no intended pharmacologic effect and are used in very low concentrations.  Radiopharmaceuticals containing 99mTc are currently being applied in the determining morphology of organs, testing of organ function, and scintigraphic and emission tomographic imaging.  The gamma radiation emitted by the radionuclide allows organs to be imaged in vivo tomographically.  Currently, over 80% of radiopharmaceuticals used clinically are labelled with 99mTc.  A majority of radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 99mTc are synthesized by the reduction of the pertechnetate ion in the presence of ligands chosen to confer organ specificity of the drug.  The resulting 99mTc compound is then injected into the body and a "gamma camera" is focused on sections or planes in order to image the spacial distribution of the 99mTc.         

99mTc is used primarily in the study of the thyroid gland - its morphology, vascularity, and function.  It is also used in the study of blood perfusion, regional accumulation, and cerebral lesions in the brain, as it accumulates primarily in the choroid plexus.  Sodium pertechnetate cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier but can be used when this barrier is damaged.  99mTcO4- is not organically bound to the target organs of the body.  Once sodium pertechnetate is injected into the body, it becomes localized in the salivary and thyroid glands, and the stomach.  99mTcO4- is rapidly excreted, and Kidney is the main path of eliminating technetium for the first three days after being injected.  After a scanning is performed, it is recommended that a patient drink a large amount of water in order to expedite elimiation of the technetium radionuclide.2  Other methods of 99mTcO4- administration include intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, as well as orally.  The behavior of the 99mTcO4- ion is essentially the same, with small differences due to the difference in rate of absorption, regardless of the method of administration.4

Preparation of 99mTcO4-. 
99mTc is made readily and conveniently available in high nuclidic purity through the decay of molybdenum-99, which decays with 87% probability to 99mTc.  The subsequent decay of 99mTc leads to either 99Tc or 99Rb.  99Mo is obtained in a nuclear reactor via irradiation of either molybdenum-98 or naturally occurring molybdenum with thermal neutrons.  99mTc is also obtained by the fission of 235U or 239Pu,3, but the isolation of 99mTc requires many steps due to the presence of other fission products and transuranium elements.1  

Once 99mTc is formed, it can be separated from 99Mo by column chromatography.  In a few cases, sublimation or solvent extration may be used.  The pertechnetate ion is formed by using acidic aluminum oxide as the packing material for the column.  At the top of the column is bound 99MoO42-.  99mTcO4- is extracted from the column by washing with a 0.15 M NaCl (" saline solution").  The eluate from the column must be sterile and pyrogen free, so that the Tc drug can be used directly, usually within 12 h of elution.1

Synthesis of 99mTcO4- radiopharmaceuticals1.
99mTcO4- is advantageous for the synthesis of a variety of radiopharmaceuticals because Tc can adopt a number of oxidation states.  The oxidation state and coligands dictate the specificity of the radiopharmaceutical.  The starting material for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals is Na99mTcO4, made available after elution from the generator column, as mentioned above.  The Na99mTcO4- can be reduced in the presence of complexing ligands.  Many different reducing agents can be used, but transition metal reductants are avoided because they compete with 99mTc for ligands.  Oxalates, formates, hydroxylamine, and hydrazine are also avoided because they also complex with the 99mTc.  Electrochemical reduction of 99mTcO4- is avoided in clinical practice because it requires excessive equipment.

Examples of organ specific radiopharmaceuticals include:
A technetium complex that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier in which 99mTcO4- reduced with tin (II) in the presence of the ligand d, l-HM-PAO to form TcO-d, l-HM-PAO (HM-PAO is hexamethylpropyleneamino oxime).
A technetium complex that is used to image the lungs, Tc-MAA, is formed from the reduction of 99mTcO4- with SnCl2 in the presence of human serum albumin.
+, which is both water and air stable, can be directly synthesized from 99mTcO4- in saline under 1 atm of CO.  This compound can be easily substituted with various biomolecules, allowing this compound to be a precursor to complexes that can be used in cancer diagnosis and therapy involving DNA-DNA pretargeting.5;

Ideally, the synthesis of the desired radiopharmaceutical from 99mTcO4-, a reducing agent, and desired ligands should occur in one step after elution, and the reaction must be performed in a solvent that can be injected intravenously, such as a saline solution.  Kits are available that contain the reducing agent, usually tin (II) and ligands.  These kits are sterile, pyrogen-free, easily purchased, and can be stored for long periods of time.  The reaction with 99mTcO4- takes place directly after elution from the generator column and shortly before its intended use.  A high organ specificity is important because the injected activity should accumulate in the organ under investigation, as there should be a high activity ratio of the target organ to nontarget organs.  If there is a high activity in  organs adjacent to the one under investigation, the image of the target organ can be highly obscured.  Also, high organ specificity allows for the reduction of the injected activity, and thus the exposure to radiation, in the patient.  The radiopharmaceutical must be kinetically inert, in that it must not change chemically in vivo en route to the target organ.

Other reactions involving the pertechnetate ion.
Radiolysis of TcO4- in nitrate solutions proceeds through the reduction to TcO42- which induces complex disproportionation processes:
 TcO4- + eaq-   TcO42-;
 2TcO42-   TcO4- + Tc(V);
2Tc(V)   TcO42- + Tc(IV);
Tc(V) + TcO42-   Tc(IV) + TcO4-;
Pertechnetate can be reduced by H2S to give Tc2S7.10;
Pertechnetate is also be reduced to Tc(IV/V) compounds in alkaline solutions in nuclear waste tanks without adding catalytic metals, reducing agents, or external radiation.  Reactions of mono- and disaccharides with 99mTcO4- yield Tc(IV) compounds that are water soluble.8;

<doc id="2233219" title="Analog Display Services Interface" nonfiltered="166" processed="164" dbindex="1500169">
Analog Display Services Interface is a telephony technology that is currently used in POTS or computer-based PBX telephone service.  It works in conjunction with a screen-based telephone ("screenphone") or other compatible CPE to provide the user with softkey access to telephone company or internal PBX custom calling features. It is an analog service because it uses analog Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) technology to interact with an LCD screen via short, low-baud rate, downloads to refresh and re-program softkeys in real-time.

The technology introduced and rolled out to RBOCs from Bellcore in April of 1995, (very soon after the introduction of CLASS-based services through ESS), was marketed by the RBOCs who implemented it, as a way to streamline all available custom calling options through the use of a screen-based telephone; giving Residential and Small Business telephone subscribers PBX-like functionality at home or in SOHO locations for a significantly low cost. The service debuted before the onslaught of PCS and VOIP-based telephony technologies became available and was originally slated to also work in conjunction with other types of services such as Enhanced Directory Assistance, telephone banking, movie theatre ticket sales, and other services that could interact with an LCD-screen.

Some of those services did become available later, though, not at the dramatic increase the US-based telephone companies had hoped.  Canadian telephone companies such as Telus and Bell Canada, however, had much better luck implementing more ADSI-based services with other industries such as banking, and still markets the service actively (as of 2005).

The service is marketed at telephone customers who subscribe to the majority of CLASS-based services offered by their local telephone company (such as caller ID, Call Return, etc) by the customization of a telephone capable of providing one-touch access to these features.  This greatly increases customer usability by alleviating the need to memorize dialing codes such as *69.

Additionally, a few RBOCs introduced new features such as Call Waiting Deluxe and Message Waiting Indicator to work exclusively with ADSI telephones. The former being perhaps the most involved example of ADSI capabilities and the latter being an example of Visual FSK; another new technology available through CLASS.

The RBOCs who offer this service also restructured their billing of these services into value-based "packages" to stimulate customer interest.

 ADSI-compatible equipment .

U S West Communications, the first local RBOC to offer this service, marketed it as "Home Receptionist" service.  Home Receptionist service included a Nortel Powertouch (or Vista) 350 screen-based telephone and "line-provisioning" service to make it work.  This service is still offered by Qwest Communications (the successor to US West), BellSouth and SBC Communications; though the service has different marketing names.

Nortel discontinued the x5x telephone line and introduced a more streamlined version called the 39x-line and then later the 48x-line in 1998.  CIDCo and Cybertronics later introduced their own lines of screenphones after the original Nortel Patent expired.  

Nortel also later sold off its CPE line to Aastra Technologies in 1999 and Aastra continues to market these telephones through various channels.

<doc id="2540987" title="Dog health" nonfiltered="167" processed="165" dbindex="1500170">
The domestic dog's health is possibly one of the best-studied areas in veterinary medicine, since the dog has had such a long and close relationship with humans.

Diseases and ailments.
Some diseases, ailments, and poisons are common to both humans and dogs; others are different.

Transferable diseases.
Most diseases that affect dogs or humans are not transferable between the two species.  There are some exceptions of zoonoses:
Rabies, or Hydrophobia, is an almost invariably fatal disease which can be transmitted to dogs or humans by the bite of an infected mammal, possibly a dog's, cat's, raccoon's, or bat's. Although rodents and similar small mammals can be infected with the disease artificially, they are generally not found infected in the wild; the current hypothesis is that they are not likely to survive any attack that would infect them. Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease. Areas that are rabies-free, (usually islands) such as Britain, Ireland, Australia, and the American state of Hawaii have strict quarantine laws to keep their territories rabies-free.  These require long periods of isolation and observation of imported animals, which makes them unattractive places to move with a pet unless the pet is quite young. Areas that are not rabies-free usually require that dogs (and often cats) be vaccinated against rabies. A person or dog bitten by an unknown dog (or other animal) should always be treated without waiting for symptoms, given the potentially fatal consequences of a rabid biter: there has been only one case of someone surviving rabies when treatment was not begun until after symptoms appeared. The biter should be apprehended if possible, as only autopsy of the brain can determine if it was rabid. This should be a great incentive to dog-owners to vaccinate their dogs even if they feel the risk of their dog contracting rabies is low, since vaccination will eliminate the need for their dog to be euthanized and examined in this fashion should it bite anyone or be suspected of biting anyone.  This applies to dogs that are showing neurological signs at the time of the bite.  Unvaccinated healthy dogs need to be confined for ten days from the time of the bite (at home or at a veterinarian depending on state law).  If the dog is not showing signs of rabies at the end of ten days, then the bitten person could not have been exposed to rabies.  Dogs and cats do not have the rabies virus in their saliva until a few days prior to showing symptoms.  Ten day confinement does not apply to other species.  A dog or cat bitten by a wild animal in an area known to have rabies should be confined for six months, because it can take that long for symptoms to start.
Parasites, particularly intestinal worms such as hookworms, tapeworms and roundworms, can be transmitted in a dog's feces. Some tapeworms have fleas as intermediate hosts: the worm egg must be consumed by a flea to hatch, then the infected flea must be ingested (usually by the dog while grooming itself, but occasionally by a human through various means) for the adult worm to establish itself in the intestines. The worm's eggs then pass through the intestines and adhere to the nether regions of the dog, and the cycle begins again.
Fleas and ticks of various species can be acquired and brought home by a dog, where they can multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). This is particularly important, now that tick-borne Lyme Disease has become endemic throughout a large area, in addition to other similar diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Although dogs do not seem to be as susceptible to such diseases as humans, similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin.

Genetic ailments.
Genetic conditions are a problem in some dogs, particularly purebreeds. For this reason many of the national Kennel Clubs require dogs to not have certain genetic illnesses in order to be registered. This is most common for hip dysplasia though it has not had optimal results. Some of the most common conditions include:
Hip dysplasia is a common problem that primarily affects larger breeds. Hip dysplasia is a defect in the hip joint which can, depending on the degree of hip luxation, be quite painful to the dog as it grows to adult size. Over time it often causes arthritis in the hips. ;
Luxating patellas can be a problem for smaller breeds. It can cause lameness and pain in the hind legs.
Genes for blindness or deafness seem to be carried by some breeds.
In some dogs, such as collies, the blue merle or harlequin coloring is actually the heterozygote of a partially recessive gene preventing proper development of the nervous system; therefore, if two such dogs are mated, on the average one quarter of the puppies will have severe genetic defects in their nervous systems and sensory organs ranging from deafness to fatal flaws.

Parasites.
Several types of parasites are commonly associated with dogs:
Intestinal worms cause varying degrees of discomfort.
Heartworm is a dog parasitoid.  It is hard to eliminate and can be fatal; prevention, however, is easily achieved using medication.
As the name suggests, an infected mosquito injects a larva into the dog's skin, where it migrates to the circulatory system and takes up residence in the pulmonary arteries and heart, growing and reproducing to an alarming degree. The effects on the dog are quite predictable, cardiac failure over a year or two, leading to death. Treatment of an infected dog is difficult, involving an attempt to poison the healthy worm with arsenic compounds without killing the weakened dog, and frequently does not succeed. Prevention is much the better course, via heartworm pills which are fed to the dog and contain a compound which kills the larvae immediately upon infection without harming the dog.  Often they are available combined with other parasite preventives.
Hydatidosis is caused by a cestode Echinococcus. This is usually noticed among dogs, wild dogs, foxes, etc. Due to its importance as a zoonosis, these worms are important to treat.  Preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treating the same. Anthelmintics such as praziquantel may help prevent this condition. Prohibition of the feeding of dogs with uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these tapeworms.

Fleas and ticks are common parasites for which there are many effective preventive measures.
Various mites cause skin problems such as mange.

Poisons.
Dangerous foods.
Some foods commonly enjoyed by humans are dangerous to dogs:

Dogs love the flavor of chocolate, but chocolate in sufficient doses is lethally toxic to dogs (and horses and possibly cats). Chocolate contains theobromine, a chemical stimulant that, together with caffeine and theophylline, belongs to the group of methylxanthine alkaloids. Dogs are unable to metabolize theobromine effectively. If they eat chocolate, the theobromine can remain in their bloodstreams for up to 20 hours, and these animals may experience fast heart rate, hallucinations, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death. A chocolate bar can be sufficient to make a small dog extremely ill or even kill it. Approximately thirty grams of baking chocolate per kilogram (1/2 ounce per pound) of body weight is enough to be poisonous. In case of accidental intake of chocolate by especially a smaller dog, contact a veterinarian or animal poison control immediately; it is commonly recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion. Large breeds are less susceptible to chocolate poisoning, but still are far less tolerant of the substance than humans are.
Note:Carob treats are often available as dog treats; these are unrelated to chocolate and are safe. ;
It has recently been confirmed that grapes and raisins can cause acute renal failure in dogs. The exact mechanism is not known, nor any means to determine the susceptibility of an individual dog. However one vet  believes it may be an acute auto-immune response to plant-borne viruses  in the same manner as FIP in cats. While as little as one raisin can be fatal to a susceptible ten pound dog, many other dogs have eaten as much as a pound of grapes or raisins at a time without ill effects. The dog usually vomits a few hours after consumption and begins showing signs of renal failure three to five days later. ;
Onions and to a significantly lesser extent garlic contain thiosulfate which causes hemolytic anemia in dogs (and cats). Thiosulfate levels are not affected by cooking or processing. Small puppies have died of hemolytic anemia after being fed baby food containing onion powder. Occasional exposure to small amounts is usually not a problem, but continuous exposure to even small amounts can be a serious threat. Garlic is also known to cause diarrhoea and vomiting.
Macadamia nuts can cause stiffness, tremors,  hyperthermia, and abdominal pain. The exact mechanism is not known. Most dogs recover with supportive care when the source of exposure is removed.
Alcoholic beverages pose much the same temptation and hazard to dogs as to humans. A drunk dog displays behavior analogous to that of an intoxicated person. (However, beer presents another problem; see below.);
Hops, the plant used to make common beer, can cause malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results. Certain breeds, such as Greyhounds, seem particularly sensitive to hop toxicity, but hops should be kept away from all dogs. Even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially deadly reaction, even if the hops are "spent" after use in brewing.
Some dogs have food allergies much as humans do; this is particular to the dog and not characteristic of the species as a whole. An example is a dog vomiting whenever he eats salmon; many humans likewise have seafood allergies.

Common household substances.
Some common household chemicals are particularly dangerous to dogs:
Antifreeze, due to its sweet taste, poses an extreme danger of poisoning to a dog (or cat) that either drinks from a spill or licks it off its fur. The antifreeze itself is not toxic, but is metabolized in the liver to a compound which causes kidney failure, and eventual seizures, and death. By the time symptoms are observed, the kidneys are usually too damaged for the dog to survive so acting quickly is important.  Immediate treatment is to administer apomorphine or peroxide solution in an effort to get the animal to vomit up as much of the antifreeze as possible.  Next, it is critical to immediately get the animal to a veterinarian.  Fomepizole (Antizol Vet® by Orphan Medical) is considered the preferred treatment for treating ethylene glycol toxicoses in dogs. Ethanol can also be used in cats and dogs, however it does have several unfavorable side effects.  Ethanol occupies the enzymes in the dog's liver, long enough for the unmetabolized antifreeze to be passed out harmlessly through the kidneys. Dogs should not be allowed access to any place in which an antifreeze leak or spill has happened until the spill is completely cleaned out. Even a very small amount such as a tablespoon can easily prove fatal.  Some brands of antifreeze that contain propylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol are marketed as being less harmful or less attractive to animals.

Mouse and rat poison is commonly found in the house or garage.  Dogs readily eat these poisons, which look like small green blocks and are very attractive to them.  The poisons work by depleting stores of Vitamin K in the body, without which blood can not clot properly.  Symptoms of poisoning include depression, weakness, difficulty breathing, bruising, and bleeding from any part of the body.  These symptoms often take 3 to 4 days to show up.  A blood test will show that the blood is not clotting properly.  If the poison has only recently been ingested (within 2 to 3 hours), the dog should be given apomorphine or hydrogen peroxide to make it vomit.  Activated charcoal can be given to absorb any remaining poison in the gastrointestinal tract.  Then the dog is given Vitamin K supplementation for 3 to 4 weeks, depending on the type of poison.  At the end of treatment, the clotting times should be tested again.  The prognosis is good in these cases.  However, if the dog is already showing signs of poisoning, it is too late to try and remove the poison from the body.  A whole blood transfusion or plasma is given to treat the anemia and to try and control bleeding.  Vitamin K is also given.  The prognosis is poor in these cases.
Mouse and rat poisons containing cholecalciferol cause hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in dogs.  Symptoms include depression, loss of appetite, vomiting blood, weakness, and shock.  Treatment is as above for recent exposure.  When hypercalcemia occurs (which can take 1 to 2 weeks), treatment is with intravenous fluids (saline), diuretics, corticosteroids, and calcitonin.  Long term prognosis is good once the dog is stabilized.

Zinc toxicity, mostly in the form of the ingestion of US pennies minted after 1982, is commonly fatal in dogs where it causes a severe hemolytic anemia. ;

Over the counter medications.
A veterinarian should be checked before any OTC medicine is used.  However, poisoning with pain medications is common.  Aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) can all cause severe symptoms in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis, acetaminophen can cause liver disease, ibuprofen can cause kidney disease, and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate.  Treatment depends on the symptoms. 

Contact your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center in case of possible exposure.

 Feeding habits and obesity .
Feeding table scraps to a dog is generally not recommended, at least in excess.  Dogs get ample correct nutrition from their natural, normal diet.  Otherwise, just as in humans, their diet must consist of the appropriate mix of nutrients, carbohydrates, and proteins, with the appropriate mix to provide all of the minerals and vitamins that they need.  A human diet is not ideal for a dog: the concept of a "balanced" diet for a  carnivore like a dog is not the same as in an omnivorous human.  Wild and feral dogs can usually get all the nutrients needed from a diet of whole prey and raw meat.  In addition, the scraps often consist of fat rather than meat protein, which is no better for dogs than it is for humans.  While not all human delicacies are acutely toxic to dogs (see above), many have the same chronically unfortunate results as they do for humans.

Lastly, many people overfeed their dogs by giving them all the table scraps that the dogs will eat which is usually all the table scraps they are fed, which is often too much food.



The result of too much food is obesity, an increasingly common problem in dogs, which can cause numerous health problems just as it does in humans, although dogs are much less susceptible to the common cardiac and arterial consequences of obesity than humans are.

Additionally, the feeding of table scraps directly from the table (as opposed to taking scraps after the meal, and giving them in the dog's food dish as a treat) can lead to trained begging behavior on the part of the dog, or even encourage the dog to reach up and take food directly from the table (another trained response). These are normally seen as undesirable behavioral traits in a dog.

Coprophagia.

Many dogs have a fondness for eating feces. Some consume their own or other dogs' feces; others seem to prefer cat feces (which, due to the feline digestive system, are high in protein and consumed by many animals in the wild), and will raid a kitty litter box for "treats". This can be unsafe for the dog's health if the animal producing the feces has any diseases or parasites or has recently ingested drugs that might be poisonous. For more information, see coprophagia.

Additional health information.
Dogs are susceptible to various diseases; similarly to humans, they can have diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, or arthritis. Other diseases are more specific to canines.

Bloat and gastric torsion.
Breeds with deep chests and narrow waists, such as the Bouvier des Flandres or Doberman Pinscher, for instance, are susceptible to a syndrome of gastric torsion and bloat, where the stomach twists on its supporting ligaments, sealing off the exits, and the contents begin to generate gas pressure which is not only terribly painful (as can be imagined by anyone who has experienced even mild gas pains), but kills large areas of stomach tissue fairly quickly, resulting in a painful death within a very few hours. A similar disease is seen in cattle and horses; and a similar home remedy has sometimes been effective when a veterinarian is not at hand, i.e. puncturing the stomach from outside with a sharp object to relieve the pressure. Obviously, such a remedy must only be attempted as a last resort. Dogs who have experienced such an attack are very susceptible to another which is usually more severe, and this is one case where the most medical intervention usually proves the best choice, normally involving abdominal surgery to tack the dog's stomach down in several places to prevent recurrence.

Vertigo.
Elderly dogs are susceptible to an unusual form of intense vertigo, the cause of which is unknown; the affected dog is unable to stand up and remains sprawled on the floor, the eyes displaying intense nystagmus, for typically a few days. While terrifying in appearance, owners often fearing that the dog has had a fatal stroke (which is actually uncommon in dogs), the vertigo passes within a few days and by the end of a week the dog is staggering around upright, and within another week there is no evidence that anything at all had happened. The only risk of the disease is that the dog is unable to eat or drink in that condition, and must receive supportive therapy of intravenous fluids and nutrition; a light sedative is usually also administered, as the dog naturally seems terrified during the experience.

Stanley M. Elkins is as of 2004 the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor Emeritus of history at Smith College.  He was one of the first academics to write about slavery in the United States, examining the effects on the slaves and their descendants.  His arguments in the 1959 Slavery : A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life, (which are controversial, and in fact not widely accepted today) are that the process of slavery made the black people relate to the dominant white slaveowners rather as children relate to their parents.  He claimed that black slaves were subjected to totalitarian treatment, and prevented from having their own culture, and that a culture of dependency was created that still existed a century later.  Elkins' views were influential during the late 1960's when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an advisor to United States President Richard M. Nixon, supported Affirmative action programs in order to counteract the lingering effects of slavery on black culture. 

Elkins's assessment of black slavery in the United States as an infantilizing and totalitarian institution was influenced by the experience of Jews who were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. He fought in the United States Army in World War II.

Initially Slavery : A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life was heralded by the black community as an important and positive contribution, but subsequently the comparison of black slavery and Nazi concentration camps was considered offensive by many descendants of both oppressed groups. The controversy is discussed by Ann Lane in her 1971 book: The Debate Over Slavery, Stanley Elkins and His Critics.

Elkins was one of the first historians to draw heavily on sociological studies. 

Elkins is also the author (with the late Eric McKitrick) of the 1993 The Age of Federalism, 1788-1800, which was the winner of the 1994 Bancroft Prize. The book discusses the relationships among key players like Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, as well as the larger political narrative of the administrations of George Washington and John Adams.

Plot details.
The movie begins with a young boy on a distant planet franticly searching the area he is in with his sword at the ready. Suddenly a loud noise alerts him that the thing he was searching for is behind him. However it is too late to react as the young boy is smashed under the foot of a lower half of a giant creature. Off in the distant, a villainous laugh can be heard. 

 

Earth as a bank robbery is taking place. The bank robbers are getting away when Great Saiyaman, Gohan s superhero disguise, stops the car with his foot and smashes the front end flinging the felons out the car to confront Great Saiyaman II (Funimation dub Great Saiyawoman), Videl s superhero disguise. They apprehend the felons and turns them into the police. All the while they were being spied on by some strange old man in the shadows. Afterward they are summoned again from their school to rescue an old man who wants to commit suicide. When Gohan and Videl enter the scene, they encounter the same man who had be spying on them. After rescuing him, the old man introduces himself as Hoi and tells the two about the legendary warrior Tapion and that he needs their help in releasing him from the music box he is being held in or the Earth would be endanger if he was not released. Gohan tries to open the box with his massive strength but it no avail his strength can not open the box. This is when he tells them he knows of the Dragon Ball and to use them to open the box. They agree to bring the box to Bulma s home first to see of another way could be used to open the box not knowing that Hoi had a other plans on his mind.


They arrive at Bulma s house with Goku, Goten, and Kuririn. After analyzing the box, Goku tries his hand at opening the box but he also can not open the sealed box. So it was decided to gather the Dragon Balls and summon Shenron to see if he can open it. After summoning Shenron, Tapion is released and the music box shatters into pieces. Angry at the fact that he was released, Tapion demands that he be sealed back again, but due to the music box being broken, it's impossible. Tapion, furious, storms off, because he is determined to stay alone in order to hide the fact he was holding the upper half of the creature called the Hirudegarn in his body . He is visited regularly by Trunks, who has taken a liking to him and brings him food, but Tapion refuses to eat and turns Trunks away. Trunks, however, becomes determined to bring him food and drinks, as he sees in Tapion what Goten has in Gohan: a older brother.

Shortly after Tapion is release, Hirudegarn's lower half starts to wreck West City. Gohan and Videl arrive at the scene to investigate, but shortly after they arrive, they are almost swept away by the monster's tail. They execute their Great Saiyaman poses, however Hirudegarn's legs are not impressed; he throws the two heroes each to opposed side of the street, with Videl losing her helmet, and Gohan losing his turban and sunglasses. Gohan immediately sets up a counter-attack, with Videl supporting him. After the short battle, Videl thinks Gohan has won, however Gohan says it isn't over yet. Tapion comes to aid Gohan and Videl by playing a magical tune on his ocarina, which weakens and Hirudegarn's bottom half, and causes it to vanish. Leaving the battlefield, Tapion comes to believe that Hoi has already killed Minosha, Tapion s younger brother.

Later on, while Trunks is visiting Tapion, Hoi attempts to steal the ocarina from Tapion and tells Trunks that Tapion is the true monster, but Trunks doesn't believe him, and instead gives the instrument back to Tapion. Tapion then befriends Trunks, and asks him to dine with him. Tapion is invited to stay at Capsule Corporation, by Trunks. While there, Tapion explains the whole story to Bulma. 

Tapion starts off with his story beginning thousands of years. On Konack, planet in the southern galaxy of the universe, a group of black magicians, the Kash-phar, use a spell on a statue to bring the monster it depicted to life. The monster, Hirudegarn, immediately goes on a rampage, killing everyone who tries to get in his way and devastating the planet. Two young heroes, Tapion and his brother Minosha, manage to freeze the monster in his tracks by each playing their divine ocarina, giving a priest the opportunity to cut the monster in half with a divine sword. Since Hirudegarn can't be killed at the time, his upper-half is sealed in Tapion and the other half in Minosha. However, fearing that the monster might reappear someday, the brothers are separated, each sealed in a music box, and shot into opposite ends of the galaxy. The music box holding Tapion lands on Earth. Soon after, Hoi, one of the Kash-phar, becomes determined to resurrect the monster to rule the universe. He releases Hirudegarn's lower half on a distant planet and easily disposes of Minosha, the young boy is crushed under the feet of the monster at the beginning of the movie. Now on Earth Hoi plans to unite the Hirudegarn s body and release the creature on Earth.

After hearing Tapion s story Bulma agrees to try to re-create the broken music box so that Tapion can finally rest.

Tapion tries sleeping inside the new chamber, but he has a terrible nightmare that causes him to destroy the chamber. At the same time, Hirudegarn's lower half is once again wreaking havoc, as he draws many men and a woman into his tail to devour their life energy. The next morning Goku, his sons, and Videl arrive at Bulma s house to inspect the destroyed chamber. Suddenly Tapion appears warning everyone the lower half of the creature is on the loose. To stop the creature from uniting it s body he ask the group to kill him, in turn killing the creature s upper half. The Hoi and the lower half of the Hirudegarn appear to stop anyone from killing Tapion. When Tapion is about to play the tone from the ocarina the power of the lower half being so close to Tapion causes the upper half in Tapion s body to react and release itself. Hoi has succeeds in his plans, and with the monster back together, he believes nothing can stop him. And a battle begins. Goku and Goten transform into their Super Saiyan forms, with Gohan using his maximum potential, thanks to Rou Dai Kaioshin's ritual, to do battle. They start to launch their counterattack. However, they are easily beaten since the monster can easily dodge by teleporting and counter their attacks. Just before Gohan gets crushed by the Hirudegarn's tail, Vegeta saves him and proceeds to fight. He transforms into a Super Saiyan. After a brief fight Vegeta is knocked into a nearby building but is knocked out after he saves the people in the building from Hirudegarn's flame attack by using all his powers to create a barrier strong enough to withstand the attack. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan 2 form but still his unable to beat the monster. Goten and Trunks decide to become Gotenks with the Fusion Dance. Gotenks now a Super Saiyan 3 seems to be enough to fight the monster but this attack only result in Hirudegarn evolving. In his new form Hirudegarn mows Gotenks down to the ground and splits Gotenks back into Goten and Trunks. Gohan and Videl are then thrown into a building and Goku gets thrown in some rubble.

Just then, Tapion plays the ocarina again and manages to seal Hirudegarn inside himself. He then asks Trunks to kill him with his own sword, which will destroy the trapped monster. Trunks hesitates at first, but is about to do as requested when Hirudegarn breaks free. His ocarina is destroyed in the process. Hoi (who's been watching the whole fight) mocks Tapion for being so foolish, but is killed as Hirudegarn steps on and crushes him. Just then Goku reappears in his powerful Super Saiyan 3 form and a battle begins between Goku and the Hirudegarn.  Nevertheless Trunks tries to fight Hirudegarn too with Tapion's sword and manages to cut off the monster's tail, but then Goku stops Trunks. Gohan yells at Goku about the weakness of the Hirudegarn which Goku already seen and uses his Ryu Ken to pierce through Hirudegarn, obliterating the monster.

With the monster gone for good, Tapion uses Bulma's time machine to go back to his own planet, after giving his sword to Trunks.

For the most part Jonathan broke off contact with Gwen and Rebecca after the divorce (when Gwen was already an adult). ;

Rebecca Hotchkiss Crane. Jonathan's first wife and Gwen's mother. Rebecca is a money grubbing, nymphomaniac. Rebecca gave up her fortune to get a divorce from Jonathan and has spent much of her time since then to recoup her loses.

Simferopol (; ; , i.e. The white mosque in Tatar) is the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Ukraine. It is situated on the small Salgir River.
History.

A famous archaeological site known as Scythian Neapol, the remnants of an ancient capital of the Crimean Scythians, is located within the city's boundaries.

Later, the Crimean Tatar town of Aqmescit was located in the area of modern Simferopol.

Russians renamed the city Simferopol in 1784 after the conquest of Crimea by Catherine II of Russia. In Greek              (Sympheropolis) means "the city of usefulness". In 1802 Simferopol became the administrative center of the Taurida Governorate. During the Crimean War of 1854-1856 Russian army reserves and a hospital were located in the city. More than 30,000 Russian soldiers were buried in the vicinity of the city.



In the 20th century Simferopol once again was affected by wars in the region. At the end of the Russian Civil War, the headquarters of General Pyotr Wrangel, leader of the anti-Bolshevik White Army, were located there. On November 13, 1920 the Red Army captured the city and on October 18, 1921, Simferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.



During the World War II Simferopol was occupied by the German army between November 1, 1941 and April 13, 1944. 
Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol, killing in total over 22,000 locals - mostly Russians, Jews, Krymchaks, and Gypsies. On one occasion, on December 13, 1941, the Einsatzgruppen D under Otto Ohlendorf killed at least 14,300 Simferopol residents.

The Soviets liberated Simferopol in April, 1944. And on May 18 the Crimean Tatar population of the city with the whole Crimean Tatar nation was forcibly deported to Central Asia.

After the war, on April 26, 1954, Simferopol, together with the rest of Crimea, was transferred from Russia to the Ukrainian SSR by Nikita Khrushchev.

Modern City.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Simferopol became the capital city of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within independent Ukraine. Today it has a population of 363,600 (as of 2004) who are mostly ethnic Russians. There are also significant Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities.

After Crimean Tatars returned from the exile in 1990s several new Crimean Tatar suburbs were erected.

The city has a railway terminus, serving millions of summer tourists each year, and the Simferopol Airport. The world's longest trolley bus line connects Simferopol to Yalta on Crimea's Black Sea coast.

Famous people from Simferopol.
 Adolph Joffe, a Russian Communist revolutionary, a Bolshevik politician and a Soviet diplomat;
 Yuri I. Manin, a Russian-born mathematician;
 Ekaterina Serebrianskaya, an individual Rhythmic Gymnast;

In Bocca al Lupo is the third full-length album release by Murder by Death. It was released on Tent Show Records, on May 23, 2006. The title comes from the Italian phrase which is loosely translated to "In the Mouth of the Wolf" and is commonly used to say "Good luck". The album is a concept album, which essentially means the songs are all connected by themes, in this case, sin and punishment.

The first single from the album is "Brother".

Guitarist and lead singer, Adam Turla, explains the meaning of each song on the band's website much like he did for their previous album, Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them?.  The following excerpt is taken from his introduction:

While the last record is one long story, the new record is 12 different stories, all about sin, redemption, and guilt. Think of them like short stories in one anthology, each about a different character who has either commmited acts that have harmed other people or are part of a bigger story where something like that has happened. There were several books that were influential in writing this album. Some of them were Dante's Inferno, Herman Melville's Benito Cereno, and Edgar Allen Poe's Fall of the House of Usher. Basically all these stories had issues that seemed relevant to the record and helped the creation of these songs.

Some of the football games are only broadcast on the mtn. and limited access of the network makes the games unavaiable to many fans. However, selected football and basketball games produced by the mtn. have been shown on CSTV.

Additionally, CSTV had a pay-per-view package for college football to compete with ESPN GamePlan during the 2005-06 season, which only showed Conference USA games. 

The network also has agreements to produce East Carolina Pirates football games and Memphis Tigers men's basketball games for local affiliates. These broadcasts also wind up on CSTV a few days later.

On October 30, 2006, CSTV broadcasted its first Canadian Collegiate football game between the University of Windsor Lancers and the University of Western Ontario Mustangs from London, Ontario. Both teams are members of Canadian Interuniversity Sport, the Canadian equivalent of the NCAA. This telecast was produced by Rogers Television, rather than by CSTV itself.

The Magenta Petrel or Chatham Island Taiko (Pterodroma magentae) is a small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, Pterodroma.

The first specimen of the Magenta Petrel was collected from His Italian Majesty's ship "Magenta" on July 22 1867 in the South Pacific ocean midway between New Zealand and South America.  The link between it and the presumed extinct Chatham Island taiko was only confirmed when the first Taiko was caught on Chatham Island, New Zealand by David Crockett on January 1st 1978.  Formerly widespread on Chatham Island the Taiko is now confined to one forested valley system on the south-west of the island.  

This medium-sized petrel has a brownish-grey back and wings, the undersides of the wings are brown and the belly is white. It has a black bill and pink legs. Adults weigh 400-600g and nest in 1-3m long burrows under dense forest. 

This species is classified as critically endangered due to an assumed 80% decline in population in the last 60 years and the fact that it is restricted to one small location. The current population is estimated at between 100 and 150 individuals and in the 2005 breeding season the 13 known breeding pairs successfuly fledged 11 chicks.

The main threats to the species are introduced mammalian predators - principally cats and rats.

Reaper is a restored historic Fifie herring drifter which is registered by the National Historic Ships Committee as part of the Core Collection of historic vessels in the UK, and currently operates as a museum ship.

History.
Built by J. & G. Forbes of Sandhaven in 1901, she is 21 metres long and of carvel construction, using larch planking on larch and oak frames. First registered at Fraserburgh in 1902, she operated initially as a sailing lugger with a main dipping lugsail and a mizzen standing lug sail. There would have been a crew of around eight to work the nets which were set at dusk and hauled in at dawn. Once the haul was complete, a swift return to port would ensure the best prices for the earliest-sold catches.

Reaper later spent many years in Shetland fishing for herring in the summer and she was fitted with an engine between the Wars. During World War II she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and served in the southeast of England, often being used as a barrage balloon mooring. After the war, she resumed fishing in Shetland and continued until 1957. From 1959 she served the local council as a general purpose cargo boat until the introduction of the roll on-roll off ferries when she was retired from service. 

Reaper today.



Reaper was purchased by the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther, Fife in 1975 and restored to her traditional sailing configuration as a two-masted sailing lugger, much as she would have appeared when first going to sea in 1902. Renamed Reaper FR958, she is one of the last authentic survivors of this type of vessel, once plentiful on the east coast of Scotland, and she holds the record catch for Shetland of 233 cran (almost 250,000 herrings). 

She sails regularly in the summer months, and in 2001, with seven people aboard, she was the centre of an emergency off the coast of northeast England when she began to take on water due to the failure of a bilge pump. A rescue helicopter was scrambled from RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and a lifeboat dispatched from Amble transferred a new pump and escorted her to harbour for repairs. . 

In 2003 she visited 14 ports around Britain, attracting 24,000 visitors; in 2005 she visited 12 ports around Britain, including a visit to the Festival of the Sea in Portsmouth, and attracted 20,000 visitors. When not sailing, the boat is berthed in Anstruther harbour opposite the fisheries museum.

Luna Peak is the highest mountain in the Picket Range, an extremely rugged subrange of the North Cascades in the American state of Washington. It is located within North Cascades National Park. It is notable for its large local relief and isolated position on a far-flung eastern ridge of the Pickets. For example, it rises over 6,560 ft (2,000 m) in 1.8 mi (3 km) above McMillan Creek to the south. 

Luna Peak was first climbed in early September 1938, by Bill Cox and Will F. Thompson. The standard route is the Southwest Ridge, approached from Ross Lake and Big Beaver Creek. It requires strenuous off-trail hiking including bushwhacking and tricky route-finding, but offers the promise of solitude, as the peak is rarely climbed. The final climb to the true summit involves exposed scrambling on loose rock, and some parties will want a rope (Class 3/4). 

The north and east faces of Luna Peak are steep and dramatic, but are not popular with mountaineers. Fred Beckey says "the peak lacks the compelling appeal of attractive alpine climbing problems." (Beckey 1995:115)

Sorten Muld is a Danish electro-folk band, formed in 1995. They have won two Danish Grammys for Mark II.  The English translation of Sorten Muld is Dark Soil.

Their music can be characterized by elegantly composed rhythms, floating sound of typical folk-instruments like bagpipes, flutes and violins, in an electronica-composition that supports the dramatic lyrics. Some tracks on Mark II are up-beat with only few lyrics and could also be characterized as dance or techno. A music critic on the US National Public Radio network described Ulla Benedixsen's voice as "...a sensuous whisper cajoling you to listen, even if you don't understand Danish."

The lyrics are old stories from Danish folk tradition, about jealousy, murder and creatures. In Kirstin from Mark II a father serves a meal of his daughter's boyfriend's heart for her. In Ulver from Mark III a man takes his girlfriend into the forest to kill her and bury her without her knowledge. He falls asleep and she cuts him in pieces with his own sword.

Sorten Muld has also published a concept album called Jord, Luft, Ild, Vand (Earth, Air, Fire, Water)   a mostly instrumental journey through the classic elements. The album is a remastered recording from a live show at Bornholm.

<doc id="412145" title="Timothy V. Johnson" nonfiltered="192" processed="190" dbindex="1500195">




Timothy V. (Tim) Johnson (born July 23 1946) is an American politician who has been a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives since 2001, representing the 15th District of Illinois  (map). He was born in Champaign, Illinois, was educated at the University of Illinois. He was a lawyer, a realtor, a member of the Urbana City Council and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1976 to 2000 before entering the U.S. House of Representatives.

Early years and education.
Johnson was born in Champaign to Robert and Margaret Evans Johnson, but spent his childhood in Urbana where he graduated high school. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1964 followed by the University of Illinois. Johnson majored in history and graduated in 1969 Phi Beta Kappa and received the Bronze tablet, an honor received by the top 3% of undergraduates. In 1972, Johnson graduated with honors from the University of Illinois College of Law and was elected to the Order of the Coif, a national legal honor society.

Johnson has divorced three times and has nine children and nine grandchildren. He was an attorney and senior partner at Frederick, Hagle, Johnson and Walsh from 1972 to 2001.

Political career.

In 1971, Johnson was elected to the Urbana City Council. 

Illinois House of Representatives.
Johnson was initially elected to serve as a representative in Springfield in 1976, after besting five other Republican candidates in the 1976 primaries. In his initial congressional race, his competitor published a photo from 1980 of a paper clip lodged into Johnson's voting button at the Illinois House of Representatives, allowing him to vote along party lines while out of the chamber.

Congressional career.
In the House, Johnson's voting record is the most moderate among Illinois Republicans outside of the Chicago area.  The American Conservative Union gave him its second-lowest rating among Illinois Republicans, behind only Mark Steven Kirk of the 10th District. 

Johnson voted against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, 
which passed but was vetoed by President George W. Bush.

In June 2006, Johnson voted against net neutrality, by voting for the COPE Act, and against the Markey amendment that would have inserted provisions to preserve network neutrality.

As part of the 108th Congress, Johnson received a rating of score of 0 from the Human Rights Campaign.  This was for, among other things, voting against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have prohibited discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation, and for refusing to adopt a written policy for his own office pledging not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in employment decisions.

 Congressional campaigns .
Campaign Costs .
In 2004, Johnson raised raised $533,478 in campaign funds, 
less than half the national average for a Republican running for reelection ($1,206,138).

The 2004 campaign fundraising was about a quarter of the

$1,943,630 raised by his initial campaign in 2000; that in turn was nearly double the amount raised by his fellow freshmen Republicans ($1,171,118).

 2006 re-election campaign .
In his 2000 campaign, Johnson pledged not to serve more than three terms.  However, he is running for re-election in 2006, for his fourth term.  Johnson "underestimated the value of seniority," spokesman Phil Bloomer says of his boss' decision to run for a fourth term. "As a rookie going in, (he) didn't understand what he could accomplish for his district by being there a longer period."

In the 2006 election in November, Johnson again faced Democrat David Gill, M.D., whom he defeated in 2004, 61% to 39%. 

At the end of June 2006, Johnson had over $130,000 available for spending for his 2006 campaign, more than double the total amount raised by his opponent at that point.  In the 2006 midterm elections, he was reelected by a slightly narrower 16% margin .  However, many of his Republican colleagues were not as fortunate, as the party lost its majority in the House in that same election.

<doc id="8781081" title="Terry de la Mesa Allen (Major General)" nonfiltered="195" processed="193" dbindex="1500198">

Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen was a United States Army officer. Allen served as a battalion commander in World War I. During World War II he was the commanding general of the First Infantry Division in North Africa and Sicily, and was made commander of the 104th Infantry Division. He is seen as "One of the great and distinguished division commanders in World War II". 

Background.
Allen was born on April 1, 1888 in Fort Douglas, Utah. He was a third generation soldier. His father, Colonel Samuel Edward Allen, had graduated from West Point in 1881 and taught philosophy there from 1892-96. Samuel Allen was a career Army officer, who served 43 years. His mother, Conchita, was the daughter of Carlos de la Mesa, a Spanish Colonel who fought in the Union Army during the Civil War. His father raised him to be a soldier and he often rode on horseback with him and his men during maneuvers. The young Allen was "Saddle-hardened before he was ten". He learned "to ride, smoke, chew, cuss and fight at the earliest possible age". His father retired from the army in 1919, and died in 1926 when Terry was 38. 

West Point.
With the goal of joining the elite service of either the cavalry or the horse artillery, Allen started West Point in 1907. For one month he was at the top of his class, but soon fell off his studies and developed a stutter. He acquired the nick-name "Tear-around-the-mess-hall Allen". While at the time West Point cadets operated under a code "within the limits of honor" to cover up fellow cadets shortcomings, but Allen's behavior was often in the public glare. One example was when "Once, during a drill, a puppy appeared. Under the eye of his sergeant, Allen whistled,  broke ranks to kneel and pet the puppy." Allen's behavior was so brazen that "When the cadet adjutant responsible for posting demerits made up his lists, he automatically included the name of Allen, T." In his second year Allen was held back a grade after failing mathematics. He then failed an ordinance and gunnery course. The faculty board decided that he was "beyond assistance" and he had to leave West Point and the Army.

Return to the Army.
Allen attended Catholic University of America in Washington, and rededicated himself to his studies. He graduated in 1912 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Allen then won a competitive Army examination and was commissioned a second lieutenant on Nov. 30, 1912. From 1912 to 1913 he was stationed at Fort Meyer, VA and then Eagle Pass, TX.

Cavalry service.
While on border duty with the 14th Cavalry in Texas, Allen saw his first action when he "pursued and captured a party of ammunition smugglers Sept. 13, 1913, near San Ambrosia Creek." In 1916 he attended Mounted Service School, at Fort Riley, KS. He , graduated in May 1916.  On July 1, 1916, Allen was promoted to First Lieutenant, at this time he served at Del Rio and Eagle Pass, TX on border duty. He was promoted to Captain on May 15, 1917. In April, 1918 he was moved to Fort Sam Houston, TX.

World War I.
As a cavalryman in a war without horses, Captain Allen was promoted to temporary Major and sent to France on June 7, 1918 (fourteen months after the US entered the war). He was assigned to the 315th Ammunition Train, but transferred to the Infantry. 

Allen arrived at a school for infantry officers the day before a class graduation. When the commandant was passing out certificates to that class Allen lined up with them. When confronted with him the commandant said "I don't remember you in this class." "I'm Allen-why don't you?" was the reply. He got the certificate and became a temporary major. Allen then led the 3rd Battalion, 358th Infantry Regiment, 90th Division into battle at St. Mihiel and Aincreville. For his performance he won a citation and a Silver Star "for distinguished and exceptional gallantry." During the fighting of Sept. 1918 Allen received a bullet through his jaw and mouth. It was noticed that after receiving the wound he never stuttered again. Allen remained with the American Expeditionary Forces in France until the Armistice with Germany (Compiègne). He then served with the Army of Occupation in Germany.

At one party in occupied Germany, Allen came late and without introductions began to drink and tell stories with a British officer until daybreak. The next day "someone asked Allen whether he knew who the Briton was. 'No, who?' said Allen. 'The Prince of Wales,' was the reply. 'Oh, my God,' said Allen." Later, the Prince (Edward Windsor) invited Allen to another party. Allen demurred saying he had already disgraced himself sufficiently. But upon the Prince's insistence he attended and had another good time.

Allen was quoted by his fellow officers as saying "I wish the war hadn't stopped when it did. It's a damn shame-I was just beginning to get good ideas about commanding infantry battalions. I wish I could go back to the front and try them out." He returned to America in Sept. 1920.

Interim period.
Allen returned to the Cavalry after his return. His 15 temporary rank was dropped so on March, 1920, he reverted to Captain, but on July 1, 1920, he was fully promoted to Major. In Sept. of 1920 he was stationed at Camp Travis, TX. By March, 1922 he was moved to  Fort McIntosh, TX and then by Sept. of that year he joined the 61st Cavalry Division, at New York City. He did little of note at this time besides strengthening his reputation as a polo player. In Jan. 1924, he entered Cavalry School, at Fort Riley, KS and graduated from the advance course in June of that year. He then entered a two year program at Fort Leavenworth's Command & General 
Staff School, seen as "all but indispensable preliminary to senior rank." In a class of 241 he rated 221st. The top of the class was then Major Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In 1928 he married Mary Frances Robinson of El Paso. Their son Terry de la Mesa Allen, Jr. was born on April 13, 1929.

In 1932, Allen took a course in the Infantry School at Fort Benning. George Marshall was assistant commander at the fort and took note of Allen's abilities. In 1940, Allen received the rank of temporary brigadier general. Allen again worked in the Cavalry duty, but he also took an interim course in infantry command with other divisions. Early in 1942, he was promoted to major general and given command of the 1st Infantry Division.

World War II.
1st Infantry Division.
Britain.
In 1942 Allen took the 1st Infantry Division to Britain. In Scotland and England they were drilled incessantly for war. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. was Allen's second in command. The third ranked member of his staff was then Colonel Henry B. Cheadle commander of the 10th Infantry Regiment. Allen's personal aide was Major Kenneth Downs, "a former newsman whom Allen met and adopted at a party shortly before the division sailed for Britain." Allen required his men train until each unit could perform a 40-mile march in 24 hours, with full field equipment. They also trained in amphibious war.  Reports reached Eisenhower that the 1st Division had a lose attitude on alcohol and even Allen, himself, was warned about drinking during the day. Allen did little to diminish his reputation as a hard drinking and hard fighting soldier's soldier.  He was hardly the gentleman's gentleman that a general officer was expected to be.  Nevertheless, his combat leadership skills were undeniable and Eisenhower needed fighters, even if they drank and swore to excess.

Allen distinguishes himself in North Africa but clashes with Patton.
Allen and his deputy 1st Division Commander, B-Gen Theodore Roosevelt Jr. Ted's were both soldiers cut from the same cloth. In North Africa, while distinguishing themselves as combat leaders their unorthodox approach to warfare did not escape the attention of General George S. Patton. Patton disapproved of officers like Ted and Allen, who "dressed down" and were seldom seen in regulation field uniforms and who did not any value in Patton's spit-shined ways.  Patton thought them both un-soldierly for it and didn't waste any opportunity to send derogatory reports of Allen to the Supreme Allied Commander.  After First Division regiments were, for a time, reassigned to support other units in Sicily, Allen was relieved of command of the First Division on August 2, 1942, and re-assigned along with Ted Roosevelt.  After criticising Terry Allen in his diary on July 31, 1943, Patton had recorded that he was going to relieve both Allen and Roosevelt, noting that he had asked permission of Eisenhower "to relieve both Allen and Roosevelt on the same terms, on the theory of rotation of command."  While neither Allen nor Ted were soldiers in the Patton mold, characterized by brashness, impetuosity, arrogance and a self-promoting style, both men were, in fact, soldier's soldiers.

104th Infantry Division.
Allen was reassigned to command the 104th Infantry Division (United States)
, nicknamed the Timberwolf Division   The 104th Infantry Division landed in France on September 7, 1944 and fought for 195 consecutive days during World War II. The division's nickname came from its timberwolf shoulder insignia. Some 34,000 men served with the division under Allen who came to be nicknamed "Terrible Terry". The division was particularly renowned for its night fighting prowess.  At the end of the war in Europe, the division was shipped back to the United States and deactivated in June 1946.

Post military life.
With the deactivation of the 104th, Terry, himself, retired from the Army on 31 August 1946.  Allen lived to watch his son, Terry's Jr's Army career take off.  Tragically, General Allen would witness his own son's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery after Terry Jr, was killed in Vietnam in 1967. General Allen died on 12 September 1969, in El Paso, Texas, at the age of 81. He was buried in the National Cemetery at Fort Bliss, with full military honors

Allen's son, an Army officer, killed in Vietnam in 1967.
Allen's son, Terry de la Mesa Allen, Jr. served as a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army.  He was killed in the Vietnam War at the Battle of Ong Thanh when his approximately 160 soldiers were ambushed by a Viet Cong regiment outnumbering the Americans almost 10 to 1. During this battle which is considered one of the most one-sided engagements of the Vietnam War, the Battalion headquarters, including Terry Junior, was destroyed, killing Terry, Jr, and almost half of Terry's command in the field. The 2/28 Battalion of the 1st Division was lost as a combat unit. The battle and the decisions leading up to it continue to remain controversial.

For the 2007 film about the Phoenix Lights, see Night Skies (film);

Night Skies was a sci-fi horror suspense thriller film that was never made. 

Origins.
Steven Spielberg came up with the idea for Night Skies in the late 1970s when Columbia Pictures wanted a sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg had no interest in a sequel, but also didn't want Columbia make a sequel without him, as Universal Pictures had done with Jaws. Spielberg came up with a treatment to a Close Encounters follow-up (instead of a sequel) initially entitled Watch the Skies (which had also been a working title for Close Encounters). Spielberg based the story on a tale of alien encounters he had heard from noted UFOlogist J. Allen Hynek while doing paranormal research for Close Encounters: back in 1955, a Kentucky family claimed that they had been terrorized and held captive by aliens who surrounded their farm and dissected their farm animals. In Spielberg's original treatment for Watch the Skies, eleven malicious extra-terrestrial scientists try to communicate with chickens, cows, and other cattle in an attempt to discover which of Earth's animal species are sentient, before turning their unwelcome attentions on the human family. Fueling Hollywood rumors about the film, NASA announced that Spielberg paid to reserve cargo space for the 1980 inaugural Space Shuttle flight, in order to film the Earth and its Moon from orbit for the film's opening sequence. Spielberg stated that he would produce Watch the Skies but not direct it, as he was under contract to direct his next film for Universal.

John Sayles and Rick Baker.
Spielberg at first wanted Lawrence Kasdan to flesh out his Watch the Skies treatment into a full-fledged script, but Kasdan was too busy writing Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, so Spielberg turned to John Sayles (who had written Joe Dante's Roger Corman-produced Jaws spoof Piranha, which Spielberg had loved). Watch the Skies was renamed Night Skies because someone owned the rights to the words "watch the skies" (which was the last line in The Thing from Another World). Some called Night Skies "Straw Dogs with aliens", but Sayles says his inspiration was the 1939 western film Drums Along the Mohawk. Sayles even named one of the aliens "Scar" (a character who was said to be "a real badass") after a Comanche Indian badguy in the John Wayne film The Searchers. Spielberg suggested that either Tobe Hooper (best known for directing and co-writing The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or Ron Cobb (a cartoonist and special effects artist who had done work on John Carpenter's Dark Star, the Mos Eisley cantina scene in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Alien.) direct the film, and Columbia chose Cobb, even though he had no directorial experience. The film was scheduled to begin shooting after Spielberg returned from filming Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg chose make-up and special effects master Rick Baker (who at the time was also working on John Landis's An American Werewolf in London) to design and create the alien creatures. 
Rick Baker built a working prototype of the lead alien that cost $70,000 and thrilled Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy when they saw a videotape of it in action while filming Raiders in London. In mid-1980, Sayles delivered his first (and in the end, only) draft of the screenplay, which featured five aliens (cut down from the original eleven) including the aforementioned Scar; "Squirt"; and "Buddy", who was kind and befriended the human family's autistic son. Sayles's script opened with Scar (who was described in the script as having a beak-like mouth and eyes like a grasshopper's) killing farm animals by touching them with a long bony finger which gave off an eerie light, and ended with Buddy, marooned on Earth by his mean-spirited peers, cowering under the shadow of a hawk.

Origin of E.T..
While Baker worked on the aliens, Spielberg was having second thoughts about Night Skies. "I might have taken leave of my senses. Throughout production of Raiders, I was in between killing Nazis and blowing up flying wings and having Harrison Ford in all this high serialized adventure, I was sitting there in the middle of Tunisia, scratching my head and saying, 'I've got to get back to the tranquillity, or at least the spirituality, of Close Encounters.'". While on the set of Raiders, Spielberg read the script to Night Skies to Melissa Mathison (who was there to see her then-boyfriend and future husband Harrison Ford) and she cried after hearing it because "the idea of an alien creature who was benevolent, tender, emotional and sweet... and the idea of the creature's striking up a relationship with a child who came from a broken home was very affecting". When Spielberg came back from Tunisia and Hawaii (where the opening of Raiders of the Lost Ark was filmed), he eagerly closed the door on Night Skies and began planning the film Mathison had dubbed ET and Me, but would in only a year and half would be known to audiences all over the world as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Rick Baker, who had spent $700,000 on unused Night Skies designs, models and animatronics, had a huge fight with Spielberg, which lead to Carlo Rambaldi (who had previously done alien creature designs for Close Encounters) doing creature designs for E.T.. John P. Veitch (then-president of Columbia's world-wide productions) and Frank Price (then president of Columbia) were also unhappy with the emergence of E.T. and didn't want to make "a wimpy Walt Disney movie". In February 1981 (six months after Columbia's desire for a Close Encounters follow-up had been fulfilled by Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition), Columbia put the Night Skies/E.T. project in turnaround. Sid Sheinberg (Spielberg's long-time friend and then-president of MCA, the then-parent company of Universal Studios) bought the Night Skies/E.T. project from Columbia, repaying them the $1 million that had been used thus far to develop the project and making a deal in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits (Veitch later said that "I think that year we made more on that picture than we did on any of our films). 

Legacy.
Although Night Skies did not make it off the ground, it still has a rather interesting and long legacy, as it helped inspire (or at least seemed to inspire) not only E.T., but also Poltergeist (which had a family terrorized by paranormal forces), Spielberg and Mathison's proposed E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears (which had malicious, animal-mutilating cousins of E.T.), Gremlins (which had one innocent and kind member of a species of otherwise mean-spirited creatures), Critters (which had a farm family terrorized by cattle-mutilating aliens), the video game Destroy All Humans!, Signs, and Spielberg's recent War of the Worlds remake.

<doc id="165062" title="Newcomen steam engine" nonfiltered="201" processed="199" dbindex="1500205">
  The atmospheric engine invented by Thomas Newcomen, today referred to as a Newcomen steam engine (or simply Newcomen engine), was the first practical device to harness the power of steam to produce mechanical work. Newcomen engines were used throughout England and Europe principally to pump water out of mines starting in the early 18th century.  James Watt's later engine was an improved version. Although Watt is far more famous today, Newcomen rightly deserves the first credit for the widespread introduction of steam power.

Precursors.
Prior to Newcomen a number of small steam engines of various sorts had been built, but most were essentially novelties. Around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains, first filling a container with water, then pressurizing it with steam to shoot it out. However these devices could not be scaled up, as the ability to produce large containers for high pressures simply didn't exist.

In 1662 Edward Somerset, second Marquess of Worcester, published a book containing several ideas he had been working on. One was a steam-powered fountain, which used vacuum instead of pressure. In his design two containers would alternately be filled with steam and then allowed to condense to produce a vacuum that would suck up more water from a well. A new charge of steam then pushed the water out as in earlier designs. By running the two containers back to back the fountain could be made somewhat continuous.

Savery's Miner's Friend.
In 1698 Thomas Savery introduced a steam powered pump he called the Miner's Friend, essentially identical to Somerset's design and almost certainly a direct copy. Applied to pumping out mines, the water was no longer driven from the cylinder by a new steam charge, but simply allowed to flow out of a valve once the steam condensed and the cylinder was filled. The process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow, so Savery later added a small water inlet or spray to quickly cool the steam.

Like other vacuum-based pumping systems, Savery's had the problem that it could not lift water more than 32 feet at a time. For deeper mines some sort of mechanical pump needed to be used, one that lifted the water directly instead of "sucking" it up. Such pumps were common already, but required a vertical reciprocating action that Savery's system did not provide.

Savery's invention acted as a kind of siphon, and had no moving parts. Consequently, it cannot really be regarded as the first steam engine, since it could not transmit its power to any external device.  There were evidently high hopes for the Miner's Friend, which led Parliament to extend the life of the patent by 21 years, so that the 1699 patent would not expire until 1733.  Unfortunately, Savery's device proved much less successful than had been hoped.  

Several other experimenters attempted to provide mechanical work from existing engine designs. One of the most interesting was that of Denis Papin, who succeeded in raising a piston by boiling water in a cylinder, and showed that the vacuum created when the steam condensed could lift a heavy weight.  However, this was merely a laboratory toy; he failed to develop it into a practical steam pump.  
 
Introduction and spread.
Thomas Newcomen developed the principles of Savery and Papin into the beam engine, in which a large wooden beam rocked up and down upon a central fulcrum. Instead of siphoning the water up, as in Savery's engine, a cylinder pump at the bottom of the mine was operated by the motion of the beam.  The cylinder was filled with steam from a boiler (usually below it).  This was condensed using a jet of water.  The resultant vacuum pulled down one end of the beam, thus operating the pump attached to the other.  

It is probable that the first Newcomen engine was in Cornwall, but its location is uncertain.  This was followed by two in the Black Country, of which the more famous was that erected at the Conygree Coalworks near Dudley, but this was probably preceded by one built a mile and a half east of Wolverhampton.  Both these were used by Newcomen and his partner John Calley to pump out water-filled coal mines.  A working replica can today be seen at the nearby Black Country Living Museum, which stands on another part of what was Lord Dudley's Conygree Park. Soon orders from wet mines all over England were coming in, and some have suggested that word of his achievement was spread through his Baptist connections. The Newcomen engine was hardly used in North America due to disputes regarding its possible interference with the production of traditionally made beaver pelts.

Since Savery's patent had not yet run out, Newcomen operated under that patent, since its term was much longer than any Newcomen could have easily obtained.  During the latter years of its currency, the patent belonged to an unincorporated company, The Proprietors of the Invention for raising water by fire.  

Although its first use was in coal-mining areas, Newcomen's engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native West Country, such as the tin mines of Cornwall.  By the time of his death, Newcomen and others had installed over a hundred of his engines, not only in the West Country and the Midlands but also in north Wales, near Newcastle and in Cumbria.



Technical details.
Newcomen's engine consisted of a boiler A, in which the steam was generated. This was usually a haystack boiler, situated directly below the cylinder. It produced low pressure steam, all that the current state of boiler technology could cope with. Steam at this pressure would be unable to move a piston of any size.

One side of the beam was attached by a chain to the pump at the base of the mine, and the chain at the other side suspended a piston within a cylinder B. The cylinder was open at the top end, above the piston P, to the atmosphere. The piston had a bevelled edge, around which hemp rope, kept in place by metal weights, acted as a primitive seal. (The rope was kept wet, so that it would expand against the sides.)

When the valve V was opened, the steam was admitted into the cylinder. After this valve was closed, valve V' was opened to allow cold water from the tank C into the cylinder, thus condensing the steam and reducing the pressure under the piston. The atmospheric pressure above then pushed the piston down in the power stroke.

This raised the working parts of the pump, but their weight immediately returned the beam to its original position. Steam was then readmitted, driving the remains of the condensate out through a one way snifter valve as the process started all over again.

Early versions used manual operation of the valves to work, but the action was slow enough that this was not a serious concern. Later versions used controls attached to the rocking beam to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions. The common story is that in 1713 a boy named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches (known as the "potter cord"). This device was simplified by 1718 according to an illustration by Henry Beighton, who showed suspended from the beam a rod called the plugtree, which worked the valves by means of tappets.

By 1725 the engine was in common use in collieries, and it held its place without material change for about three-quarters of a century.  Towards the close of its career the atmospheric engine was much improved in its mechanical details by John Smeaton, who built many large engines of this type about the year 1770.   

While its main use was pumping water out of mines, the Newcomen engine was also used in some places to pump water to drive machinery, for example refilling the upper pool at Coalbrookdale so that there was more water available to drive the blast furnaces, also at Madeley Wood or Bedlam Furnaces and others of the same period (the 1750s.   Richard Arkwright, for example, even attempted to use a Newcomen engine to pump water to power a waterwheel.

Successor.
The main problem with the Newcomen design was that it was very expensive to operate. After the cylinder was cooled to create the vacuum, the cylinder walls were cold enough to condense some of the steam as it was sprayed in. This meant that a considerable amount of fuel was being used just to heat the cylinder back to the point where the steam would start to fill it again. As the heat losses were related to the surfaces, while useful work related to the volume, increases in the size of the engine increased efficiency. Newcomen engines became larger in time. However, efficiency did not matter very much within the context of a colliery, where coal was freely available. Attempts were made to drive machinery by Newcomen engines, but these were unsuccessful, as the single power stroke produced a very jerky motion.

Newcomen's engine was only replaced when James Watt improved it to avoid this problem (Watt had been asked to repair a model of a Newcomen engine by Glasgow University. A model exaggerated the scale problem of the Newcomen engine.). In the Watt steam engine, condensation took place in a separate container, attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe. When a valve on the pipe was opened, the vacuum in the condensor would, in turn, evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston. This eliminated the cooling of the main cylinder, and dramatically reduced fuel use. It also enabled the development of a reciprocating engine, with upwards and downwards power strokes more suited to transmitting power to a wheel.

Watt's design, introduced in 1769, did not eliminate Newcomen engines immediately. Watt's vigorous defence of his patents resulted in the desire to avoid royalty payments as far as possible.  

The expiry of the patents led to a rush to install Watt engines in the 1790s, and Newcomen engines were eclipsed - even in collieries. Probably the last Newcomen-style engine to be used commercially   and the last still remaining on its original site   is at Elsecar, near Barnsley in South Yorkshire.

What is a "New Hippie"?

It is noteworthy to mention the origin of the "New Hippies" so as not to confuse them with the hippie movement of the 1960's.

Way back in the 60's there was a portion of the population who refused to conform, or fit in, but beyond that they rebelled against anything they could find to rebel against. It was save the trees, love the earth, protect the wine-sap-duck-billed furry-kneed speckle-winged swamp-owl, make copious love with anyone and everyone, but don t make war. To say they were "unconventional" would be putting it mildly. Those were the 60's Hippies, or for lack of a better term, the "Old Hippies".

Forty years later and everything old is new again, including the newest breed of hippies, the next generation of hippies, the "New Hippies". They are *NEW* not only because they are a new generation, but because they think they are the first ones to wear tie-dyed clothing, protest against a President and his war, or fighting the *Man* and his new upscale development. They are a new group of disgruntled, monetarily challenged, property ownership deprived, and *temporarily* unemployed deadbeats with nothing better to do than make life difficult for the rest of us who actually WORK for a living and try to contribute more to society than what was given us.

Also known in certain circles as "artists", "actors", or "musicians".

Thomas James Churchill (10 March 1824   10 March 1905) was a Confederate major general during the American Civil War and a governor of the state of Arkansas.

Thomas J. Churchill was born near Louisville, Kentucky. He was educated at St. Mary's College and studied law at Transylvania University. He served during the Mexican-American War and rose to the rank of lieutenant in a regiment of mounted infantry. He was captured by the Mexican Army and remained a prisoner of war until near the end of the conflict. In 1848, he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, married the daughter of Senator Ambrose Sevier, and became a planter.

At the start of the Civil War, Churchill offered his services to the state and was elected Colonel of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles. His first combat took place at the Battle of Wilson's Creek near Springfield, Missouri. On 4 March, 1862, he was promoted to brigadier general and soon thereafter took part in Kirby Smith's Kentucky Campaign. Churchill played an important role in the victory at Richmond, Kentucky.

In the latter part of 1862, Churchill was transferred back to Arkansas and placed in charge of the fortifications at Arkansas Post. In January 1863, the Post was attacked and seized in the Battle of Fort Hindman by an overwhelming Union force under Major General John McClernand. On 17 March, 1863, Churchill was promoted to major general and transferred to the Army of Tennessee. He remained only a short time and returned to the Trans-Mississippi District and served during the Red River Campaign in command of a division of Arkansas infantry. He played a major role in the Battle of Jenkins Ferry.

After the war, Churchill was Arkansas State Treasurer from 1874 to 1880 and was Governor of Arkansas from 1881 to 1883.

Churchill is buried at historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Claire is eagerly preparing for her gallery opening. Russell is still sore about Claire's rise to fame, so Anita breaks up with him and buys Claire cocaine in honor of her success. At the gallery, a coke-influenced Claire rattles on about her work to everyone, but neglects Jimmy entirely. After a short confrontation with Claire, Jimmy storms out, taking Anita with him. Russell verbally assaults Claire after the show ends, but Billy scares him off. Billy takes Claire home, and they kiss.

David is still unable to cope with the hitchhiker incident and continues to have dreams of the hitchhiker, Jake. Keith suggests that David visit Jake in jail in order to move on. When David meets Jake, he is surprised at how crazy Jake really is and demands an apology, but finally realizes that the situation can't be helped; Jake is sick.
The next morning, he has a vision of his father supporting his decision and comforting him.

Keith is forced to meet Roger Pasquese at his house when Roger threatens to start up their lawsuit again. Having been blackmailed, Keith agrees to meet him. Roger tells Keith about a job offer: Roger wants him to be his bodyguard. Keith promises to give the matter serious consideration.

George and Ruth meet George's daughter, Maggie, at a restaurant, and Ruth is delighted to meet a member of George's family. Maggie is a pharmaceutical representative, and she gives George some medication, the purpose of which George doesn't reveal to Ruth. Maggie continues to tell Ruth about George's past; she mentions all the times he took Maggie camping, but also reveals that George may have some unspecified problems. Ruth becomes especially suspicious when George has dark fantasies about a mysterious woman in turquoise and talks to himself, and phones Maggie about George's situation.
Ruth awakens in the middle of the night and finds George dozing in the bomb shelter. When he wakes up, he refuses to leave the shelter and go to the house.

Rico becomes increasingly lonesome. He bonds with the wife of a deceased man, whom she had divorced fifteen years earlier. Her speech about where her ex-husband is going to be buried inspires Rico to confront Vanessa. He apologizes to her about everything: the money, the intimacy, and the attention he gave to the stripper, Sofia. Vanessa accepts his apology. Rico then states that he should move back in and they should continue their life together. Vanessa says that life can't return to the way it was, and despite the fact she still loves him, she wants a divorce.

Nate is nervous about Barb and Hoyt's threat to take Maya away from him, and keeps calling his lawyer. In doing so, he becomes more and more distant from Brenda. He gives David a book, Stiff, which Michaela told him to give to David. While flipping through the pages, David and Nate find a photo of Lisa. Nate realizes that the photo shows Lisa wearing the outfit she was wearing the day she disappeared and is standing in the same place her car was found. He then decides to drive up to Santa Cruz and talk to Michaela in person. When he arrives at the Woodworth residence, Nate asks Michaela where the picture came from. She doesn't know, but tells him to talk to her father, Hoyt.
Nate finds Hoyt in his office and asks him about the picture. Hoyt lies and says the picture was taken a few years earlier. Then he cracks under pressure and reveals that he and Lisa had an ongoing affair. Hoyt accuses Nate of forcing Lisa to kill herself, but Nate demands to know what happened at that beach where she disappeared. Hoyt says that Lisa ended the affair, but that he couldn't let her tell Barb.
Hoyt and Nate hear a whimpering coming from the stairwell. Barb heard the whole thing. Hoyt quickly reaches into his desk drawer, takes out a gun, and shoots himself in the mouth.

Nate returns home the next morning. He sees Brenda sitting with Maya on her lap, hugs them, and says to Brenda, "Let's get married and have a baby."

Ridgmont railway station is a small (unstaffed) railway station that serves the villages of Ridgmont in Bedfordshire (about 2km (1.25 miles) away on the other side of the M1 Motorway at Junction 13) and Brogborough. It also serves the large Amazon.com warehouse next door.  

It is located on the Bletchley-Bedford Marston Vale line.

The station is served by Silverlink County local services from Bletchley to Bedford. Services are operated using Class 150/1 diesel multiple units.

General Information.

Ridgmont is located within visual range of Junction 13 of the M1 and the station is overshadowed by a number of distribution centres.

It was at Ridgmont that a new Marston Vale signalling control centre was built as part of the Bedford-Bletchley route modernisation in 2004. This centre replaced all of the signal boxes on the route.

It was planned in the 1860s to extend the railway between Wolverton and Newport Pagnell to meet with the Marston Vale line at Ridgmont, however this extension was never built.

The Siwalik is a relatively low-altitude mountain range cresting at 900 to 1,200 meters.  They extend 1,600 km from the Teesta River in Sikkim, westward through Nepal and Uttarakhand, continuing into Jammu and Kashmir.  The Mohan Pass is the principal pass accessing the Siwalik Hills from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh to Dehra and the hill station of Mussoorie in Uttarakhand. 

The Siwalik Hills are chiefly composed of sandstone and conglomerate formations which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range in their rear, but often poorly consolidated. Sivapithecus (a kind of ape, formerly known as Ramapithecus) is among many fossil finds in the region.

Immediately south of these low mountains is an alluvial belt called the Terai, which apparently means "marshland" in Persian. This zone has many springs fed by monsoon rains falling on the uplands and absorbed into interspaces of the sedimentary rocks.  This moist area was heavily malarial before DDT was used to suppress mosquitos, 

North of the Siwalik belt lies another range of foothills, the somewhat higher (1,500-3,000 meter) Mahabharat Lekh (Range) also known as the Lesser Himalaya, although in many places valleys 10-20 km wide separate the Siwalik and Mahabharat ranges.  These valleys are called Duns or Doons in India (for example the Doon Valley) which includes Dehradun, as also Patli Dun and Kothri Dun, both in Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, and also Pinjore Dun in Himachal Pradesh.  In Nepal, they are part of the  Inner Terai (for example Chitwan, Dang, Deukhuri and Surkhet).

The permeable sediments and poorly-developed soils of the Siwalik hills do not retain water between storms and are unsuited to agriculture. They are lightly populated by a few tribal groups, especially the Van Gujjars, or Gujjars, that follow a quasi-pastoral livestock-dependent lifestlyle and are responsible for heavy deforestation and denudation in many parts, given that the size of their herds has dramatically outgrown the ecosystems' capacity to sustain them.

The (misnamed) NASA Chicken Gun is one of several large diameter compressed air cannon used by the Federal Aviation Administration and US Air Force to test the strength of Aircraft Windshields and the safety of Jet engines.  A common danger to aircraft is that they collide with birds in flight.  Most parts of an aircraft are strong enough to resist such a bird strike.  Jet engines may sustain serious damage, however, and cockpit windows are necessarily made of transparent materials and are a vulnerable spot.  Testing to see what the risks are is required.

The Chicken Gun is designed to simulate high speed bird impacts.  It is named after its usual projectile: a whole dead standard sized chicken, as would be used for cooking.  This has been found to accurately simulate a fairly large bird.  The test target is fixed in place on a test stand, and the cannon is used to fire the chicken into the engine, windshield, or other test structure.

There is a longstanding urban legend about the gun being loaned to some other agency, who fired frozen chickens instead of thawed chickens.  Research indicates that this is apparently a myth.

Guns are operated by the FAA and the US Air Force rather than NASA, as is commonly believed.

<doc id="2070538" title="Dog society" nonfiltered="212" processed="210" dbindex="1500216">
Dog society has traditionally been thought of as dog packs characterized by companionate hierarchy, in which each individual has a rank, and in which there is intense loyalty within the group. Dogs thrive in human society because their relationships with humans mimic their natural social patterns. A dog supposedly always has a rank relative to other individuals in the group. This is not true.  There are no ranks in a dog's mind.  The pack only exists to facilitate the hunting of large prey (though new theories suggest the pack strategy instead maximizes reproductive success and has less to do with hunting).  An assertive dog may take the role of the mythical or theoretical alpha animal, considering its human master to be subordinate.  Some recent research, however, indicates that, rather than a hierarchy, dogs and wolves form a family group and individuals display assertiveness or passiveness, rather than dominance and submission, which are uncommon in wild wolves.

Dominance and submission.

Dogs, like wolves, establish a hierarchy through aggressive play and roughhousing along a continuum of dominance and submission. When kept as pets, dogs include humans in this hierarchy or social group. It is important for successful socialization that puppies participate with their littermates in learning to relate to other dogs. Dogs learn to successfully relate to other dogs by keeping the peace rather than constantly fighting to reestablish this hierarchy.

Dominance behavior.
Dominant dogs generally take the initiative and are more active than less dominant dogs.  Displays of dominance include standing above or over other dogs, placing a paw on other dogs, holding the tail and ears erect, looking directly at other dogs, circling and sniffing other dogs, growling if the other dog moves, and aggressive marking of territory with urine. Submissive displays mirror dominant displays and include adopting a posture that is lower than other dogs, such as crouching, rolling over on the back and exposing the abdomen, lowering the tail even tucking it beneath the legs, flattening of the ears, averting the gaze, nervously licking or swallowing, dribbling of urine, and freezing or fleeing when other dogs are encountered.

Ideally, the dominant/submissive social structure of dogs avoids conflict and enforces social stability. Poorly socialized dogs who are inept at establishing dominance hierarchy may become involved in excess conflicts, especially from a human viewpoint. People who misunderstand dog behavior or who have inadvertently placed themselves in a disadvantageous position within the dominance submissive hierarchy can find themselves participants in similar conflicts with the animal(s). 

It is problematic to anthropomorphize the dominance/submission behavior of a pet or to mistake it for characteristics more appropriately applied to humans. It can be dangerous for a dog to be dominant relative to its master or mistress. Owners who inadvertently reward dominance or assertiveness by giving in to a dog's demands and preferences may cause the dog to feel that it is more important than its owner or than other dogs. Likewise, submission in a dog is not necessarily an indication of a problem dog. Continuing to discipline a dog after it has adopted a submissive or appeasement  posture is contrary to a goal of obedience.

Behavior when isolated.

Dogs value the companionship of the others in their "pack" and are sometimes distressed if they are separated from it. Typical reactions when a dog is separated from the pack are barking, howling, digging, and chewing. These activities may distress humans when they need to leave dogs alone for a period of time. However, this behavior, called separation anxiety, can be overcome with training, or at least decreased to the point where it becomes manageable. If young puppies are habituated to periods alone from an early age, this can normally be prevented entirely. Some owners struggling to deal with this problem resort to debarking.

Favorite activities.
Dogs enjoy spending time with and interacting with other dogs. Roughhousing and chasing one another are favorite activities. Off-leash dog parks can be good places for dogs to exercise and interact with other dogs. When seeking relaxation, dogs enjoy lying about with their companions, favoring spots with a good view of their surroundings.

Recent research.
Dr. David Mech of the University of Minnesota, who has studied wolves in their natural habitat, claims that new evidence about the behavior of wild wolf packs shows that the traditionally described hierarchy in wolf packs does not actually exist. He no longer uses the word "alpha" because "It falsely implies a hierarchical structure in which a wolf assumes a place in a linear hierarchy."  Mech also states that dominance is rare in wild wolves. Instead of "dominance" and "submission", he uses the terms "assertiveness" and "passiveness".

Mullum-Mullum Creek is an environmentally-sensitive area in the east of Melbourne (Australia). The creek begins in the Yarra ranges and eventually flows into the Yarra River. The creek, as well as being home to endangered platypuses, supports the eco-system of the surrounding valley.

The problems affecting the region are residential development and the construction of a new freeway named EastLink.

Under political pressure, the premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, decided to build two 1.5km tunnels under the sensitive area. However, this was not good enough according to some residents who wanted a 3km tunnel to go under the entire area.

The Eurovision Song Contest 1971 was the sixteenth Eurovision Song Contest and held in Dublin, Ireland. The new voting system that was introduced in this Eurovision did have one big problem: some juries gave less points out than others. Whether this was done in some cases to increase their respective countries' chances of winning is impossible to say, but the shortcomings of the system were nevertheless plain.

This was RTÉ's first outside broadcast in colour.

Monaco's win was their first.

Youth Dub is a bonus disc released in conjunction with Matisyahu's second studio album Youth, both discs were released on March 7, 2006 (see 2006 in music). The Youth Dub disc is included with some copies of the Youth album and available as a limited edition stand alone album. Producer Bill Laswell made a King Tubby style dub remix of the Youth album. Adding effects and forefronting the music of the backing band Roots Tonic rather than Matisyahu's vocals. Laswell was so impressed with the band that he invited them back into his studio and teamed up for an all instrumental dub album, Roots Tonic meets Bill Laswell.

Melanthiaceae is the botanical name of a family of flowering plants.  Such a family has been recognized by relatively few taxonomists, and the circumscription has varied.  Many authors have considered these plants to belong to the family Liliaceae. 

The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does recognize such a family and places it in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. As circumscribed by APG II it includes the plants that sometimes have been treated as family Trilliaceae. The family includes Paris quadrifolia and Trillium.

Vejigante are clownlike characters present in Puerto Rican carnival celebrations.  They wear brightly colored costumes with batlike wings and ornate paper mache masks.  They are called Vejigante because of the custom of blowing up and painting a cow's bladder, or vejiga.  The vejiga is used to scare small children. It is also used as a type of gargoyle-like figure to scare away evil spirits.

The vejigante is old enough to have been mentioned in Don Quixote (1605). Vejigantes may also have roots in Afican tribal ceremonies brought by black slaves.

Newport City Live Arena is a large grade-II listed building in the city of Newport, South Wales.

It is located on the east side of the city centre, in the Maindee area. The building is one of the only true examples of Art deco architecture in Newport. Opened in March 1938, it was originally an Odeon cinema, designed by Harry Weedon. The cinema closed in 1981, fell derelict in the following years and was facing the possibility of demolition.

After many years of the ground floor being used as snooker hall, the building was bought by a local businessman in 2003 and it was transformed at a cost of over £1 million. Currents features included a huge TV screen, to show live sporting events, and a stage that has played host to several famous music acts in recent years.

Kimball Collins born and raised in Orlando, Florida, Collins began DJing in 1987. 

Along with Christopher Lawrence, Kimball Collins is one of the few American trance DJs to rank with British heroes like Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, and John Digweed. 

By the end of the '80s, his clubnights at the Beacham Theater helped jump-start the dance scene in Orlando, which by the late '90s had become one of America's new rave capitals. He branched out to include DJ gigs all across America and formed his own PositiVibes Records in 1993. With partner Rich Dekkard, Collins' first single "Hardlife"/"Lushlife" became a double-sided club smash, licensed all over Europe. 

In 1994, Collins became the first of almost a dozen mixers to helm a volume in the United DJs of America series and one year later, he released a label mix compilation titled PositiVibes. Collins also managed to expand his mixing career into Europe, an area with no shortage of trance DJs eager to take the decks. The Max Music label signed Collins on for a mix album series in 1999, and released three albums during the next two years: ICU: Session, Vol. 1, ICU Generation: Trance 2000 Episode 01, and Clubnights, Vol. 2: Live at Club Utopia.

After getting a near lethal dose of electricity from an electrical disturbance Bender realizes he has a problem.  Bender joins the Temple of Robotology, on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell. After baptizing him in oil, the Preacherbot welds the symbol of Robotology to Bender's case.

After Bender annoys his coworkers with his new-found religion, Fry and Leela decide to reacquaint him with his old lifestyle. They fake a delivery to Atlantic City, and tempt Bender with alcohol, prostitutes, and easy targets for theft. Bender succumbs, rips off the Robotology symbol, and tosses it away. The symbol beeps ominously as it sinks into a bowl of dip.

Later, Bender is interrupted in the process of seducing three female robots by a knock at his hotel room door. When he opens the door, an orange glow spills into the room, and a pitchfork reaches into the room and knocks him out. He awakens to a greeting from the Robot Devil and finds himself in Robot Hell. Fry and Leela discover that Bender is missing, and attempt to track him down using Nibbler's sense of smell.

While in Robot Hell, the Robot Devil informs Bender that he agreed to be punished for sinning when he joined Robotology. In the meantime, following Bender's scent, Fry and Leela arrive at an abandoned New Jersey amusement park, where they find the entrance to Robot Hell.

A musical number starts as the Robot Devil begins detailing Bender's punishment. As the song ends, Fry and Leela arrive, and try to bargain for Bender's life. The Robot Devil tells them (pursuant to the Fairness In Hell Act of 2275) that the only way to win back Bender's soul is to beat him in a playing contest using a solid gold violin (a reference to the song The Devil Went Down to Georgia). When Leela's fiddle playing pales to the Robot Devil's performance (she in fact holds the violin on the wrong side), she beats the Robot Devil with the fiddle. 

As the three flee the Robot Devil's clutches, Bender steals the wings off a flying torture robot, attaches them to his back, and airlifts Fry and Leela to safety in a scene similar to an angel rising to heaven, though Leela had to drop the golden fiddle onto the Robot Devil first before they successfully escape.

 Song .

Robot Hell.
Robot Devil: Cigars are evil, you won't miss them;
We'll find ways to simulate that smell;
What a sorry fella;
Rolled up and smoked like a panatela;
Here on level one of Robot Hell;

Gambling's wrong and so is cheating;
So is forging phoney I.O.U.s;
Let's let Lady Luck decide;
What type of torture's justified;
I'm pit boss here on level two;

(Robot Devil spins Bender on Roulette wheel with various tortures listed on it, as well as "Pleasant Massage") Oooh--deep fried robot;

Bender: Just tell me why;
Robot Devil: Please read this fifty-five page warrant;
Bender: There must be robots worse than I;
Robot Devil: We checked around, there really aren't;
Bender: Then please let me explain;
My crimes were merely boyish pranks;
Robot Devil: You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks;
Bender: Aw, Don't blame me, blame my upbringing! (Bender tries stealing Robot Devil's wallet);
Robot Devil: Please stop sinning while I'm singing!;

Selling bootleg tapes is wrong;
Musicians need that income to survive;
Beastie Boys: Hey Bender gonna make some noise;
With the harddrive scratched by the Beastie Boys;
That's whatcha-whatcha-whatcha get on level five;

(Fry and Leela are shown on a slide that leads down to Robot Hell.);
Fry: I don't feel well;
Leela: It's up to us to rescue him;
Fry: Maybe he likes it here in Hell;
Leela: It's us who tempted him to sin;
Fry: Maybe he's back at the motel;
Leela: Come on, Fry don't be scared.;
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared;
So just sit back; enjoy the ride;
Fry: My ass has blisters from the slide;

Robot Devil: Fencing diamonds, fixing cockfights;
Publishing indecent magazines;
You'll pay for every crime;
Knee-deep in electric slime;
You'll suffer 'till the end of time;
Enduring tortures, most of which rhyme;
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell;

Characters.
Characters who first appear in this episode are:
The Robot Devil;
Reverend Lionel Preacherbot;

Cultural references.
The title is a riff on a famous line ("Hell is other people") from Jean Paul Sartre's one act play No Exit.
 The Beastie Boys perform their 1999 hit single "Intergalactic", while Fry refers to Prince's song "1999".
 When first entering Sparky's Den, Bender's eyes are solid blue, resembling those of a spice addict in the Dune universe.
The Robot Devil actually performs an excerpt from La Ronde des Lutins ("The Dance of the Goblins") by Antonio Bazzini.
The fiddle playing duel with the Robot Devil is a reference to the story depicted in "The Devil Went Down to Georgia.";
 When Leela says, "Who would have thought that hell really exists? And that it would be in New Jersey?" she is perhaps alluding to the famed Jersey Devil, while Fry's response of "Actually..." is a continuation of the running joke that New Jersey is an unpleasant place to live.
 In the Temple of Robotology, prior to Bender's baptism, there are two lines parodying the BASIC programming language on a banner above the altar:
10 SIN;
20 GOTO HELL;
 The symbol of Robotology that is welded onto Bender's stomach is the symbol used in wiring schematics for a resistor.
The location of Robot Hell is under a ride called the Inferno, which can be slightly linked with the Robot Devil's ironic punishments and Dante's Divine Comedy. It also parallels the Dean Koontz novel Hideaway, in which a serial killer who believes himself to be a demon prince of Hell performs satanic rituals under a ride in an abandoned amusement park.

Goofs.
When Bender picks the Robot Devil's pocket, the Robot Devil disconnects Bender's arm before throwing him down to the next level of Robot Hell.  However, as soon as Bender lands in the very next scene, his arm is intact.
The Robot Devil is noticeably larger than Fry in this episode compared to his size in the episode entitled "The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings".

Trivia.
This episode, along with its animatic version, is one of four featured in the Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection, reflecting its popularity with both fans and the creators of Futurama. ;
The title of the episode appears on the front of the pamphlet The Robot Devil hands to Bender, also appearing with a picture of The Robot Devil.
The Professor states that in the future Voodoo and Oprahism are mainstream religions.
The person rolling the Beastie Boys off and on the stage is Scruffy the janitor of the Planet Express.
When Fry and Leela first enter the amusement ride The Inferno there is a heart on the wall with "H.S & M.B." in the center, a reference to Homer Simpson and Marge Bouvier in The Simpsons.
When saying robot grace, talking in Binary, Bender uses the number two (whereas binary uses only zeros and ones). This is an allusion to ghosts. This is also brought up later when in the Haunted Mansion attempting to locate the Original Were-car, and bender says he could "Swear he saw a two" and when Bender had a bad dream, Fry states "There's no such thing as two.".
When Leela takes her turn with the fiddle, she demonstrates how little she knows about the instrument by holding it in the wrong arm.

<doc id="4392689" title="Alexios Branas" nonfiltered="228" processed="226" dbindex="1500232">
Alexios Branas or Alexius Branas (died 1187) was a Byzantine nobleman and military leader of the late 12th century.

Alexios Branas was doubly linked to the imperial Komnenos family. He was the son of Michael Branas and of Maria Komnene, who was the great-niece of Alexios I Komnenos. He himself married Anna Batatzaina; she was the niece of Manuel I Komnenos, and her sister, Theodora, was Manuel's lover.

Branas was one of relatively few generals who never rebelled against Andronikos I Komnenos, fighting for him successfully against the forces of Béla III of Hungary in 1183, against a rebellion led by  Andronikos, Isaac and Alexios Angelos in 1184, and against the Norman invaders of Thessalonica under William II of Sicily in 1185.

In 1187, shortly after the accession of Isaac II Angelos, Branas was sent to counter the Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion. This time he did rebel. He was defeated by Conrad of Montferrat, the emperor's brother-in-law, who commanded the centre of the imperial forces in the battle. Branas wounded Conrad, who nevertheless unhorsed him, his lance striking the cheekpiece of his helmet. Branas was then beheaded by Conrad's supporting footsoldiers. The head was taken to the imperial palace, where it was treated like a football, and was then sent to Branas's wife Anna, who (according to the historian Niketas Choniates) reacted bravely to the shocking sight.

It was probably after his death that his son, Theodore Branas, became the lover of the dowager Empress Anna (Agnes of France): they were together by 1193 according to the Western chronicler Alberic of Trois-Fontaines. Alexios Branas also had a daughter, probably named Eudokia, who married Isaac Angelos, son of the sebastocrator John Doukas.

<doc id="8852087" title="Glass's Guide" nonfiltered="231" processed="229" dbindex="1500235">
The Glass s Guide is the UK motor trade s  Bible  for used car prices.  

By monitoring car values over the past 70 years, Glass s Guide has reflected how cars have become increasingly affordable. For example, in the 1930s the £145 list price for a Ford 10 De Luxe, including £5 for an optional sliding roof, was the equivalent of almost two years  salary. Today, a Ford Mondeo 1.8i LX, with a list price of £14,465, represents the equivalent of just seven months  salary for a person earning the UK average wage.

Glass s history.

William Glass founded Glass s in 1933 and published the first Glass s Guide to Car Values in July that year. The company expanded into commercial vehicle, motorcycle and caravan values in the 1950s and  60s, and today provides customers with information in print, electronic and online formats.

1930 s
In 1933 William Glass first publishes Glass s Guide to Car Values which quickly becomes the  Bible  of the UK motor trade.

1950 s
Hanns W. Schwacke applies the same idea in Germany becoming the first of its kind in continental Europe.

1960 s
Hanns W. Schwacke expands the business in Europe under the international brand  Eurotax .  Glass s launches used valuations Guides for commercial vehicles and motorcycles in the UK. 

1970 s
The first estimation system, including parts prices and labour costs for all makes and models, is launched. 

1980 s
The information revolution takes off   the PC transforms  the workplace.  Glass s introduces the PC version of Glass s Guide and acquires Editions Professionelles Glass  SARL (EPG) France.  Eurotax launches the AutoWert workplace software which becomes the standard for over 50,000 users across Europe.

1990 s
The Eurotax and Glass s data becomes industry standard and is used by European governments to drive national registration systems.  New, innovative solutions for the industry are created to support mechanical and accident repairs, bodyshop management, vehicle re-marketing and salvage disposal.  These include ICME+, Glassmatix, BodyMaster, Trader Desk and eSalvage.

2000
Eurotax and Glass s merge to create the European market leader in automotive business intelligence. 

William Glass.

William Glass was born in Scotland in 1881 and was an engineer by trade. As well as publishing the first Guide to Used Vehicle Values, Glass had an innovative and enquiring mind and made a number of inventions including the portable hydraulic jack, the electric switch-off kettle, the self-filling fountain pen and the through-the-propeller machine gun firing mechanism.

The founder of Glass s Guide also manufactured cars under the Firefly marque for a short period of time in Croydon. Glass s other innovations included the first motor auction and the first uniformed attendants at petrol filling stations.

The Guide.

The success of the Glass's Guide can be seen by the way it influences the market. It can be argued that Glass's now have so much influence that they are now setting market prices rather than monitoring them.

<doc id="3556831" title="The Phil Hendrie Show" nonfiltered="232" processed="230" dbindex="1500236">


The Phil Hendrie Show was a comedy talk radio program syndicated throughout North America on Premiere Radio Networks and on XM Satellite Radio. It was known for outrageous guests, all of whom were fictional and voiced live by the host, Phil Hendrie.

Though Hendrie often explained that he was doing the voices, listeners unfamiliar with the show's format were invited to call, duped into believing that the guests on the show were real. He rapidly switched back and forth between a studio microphone and a conventional telephone, creating the illusion that his "guest" had called into the show. Adding to the illusion, the telephone line often featured recorded background noises that simulated various locations, such as a bowling alley, or the kitchen of a restaurant, or, on at least one occasion, a bathroom.

The show ran for nearly 16 years, from August 1990 to June 2006. At least one station continues to air the show in reruns as of January 2007.

 Show history .
After being influenced by The Jerky Boys, Hendrie began doing voices on his program at KVEN in Ventura, California during the Gulf War when he created "Raj Fahneen," an Egyptian who demanded that George H. W. Bush bow down to Iraqis. After leaving KVEN in 1992, Hendrie did a short stint as an evening host at WSB-AM in Atlanta before moving to WCCO-AM in Minneapolis. Phil left WCCO-AM on March 12, 1994 and moved to WIOD in Miami. Hendrie hosted the afternoon drive-time slot, and further developed his characters personalities, adding their lasting traits. He garnered a large fan base there, and released three "Best Of" CDs, all of which benefited the Miami charity organization Center One. In 1996, Hendrie moved to KFI in Los Angeles to further develop his show and reach a larger audience. In September 1999, Hendrie became syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks, and eventually reached around 100 affiliates.

Early in his program's syndication, Hendrie was reluctant to reveal that he was the voice behind his outrageous "guests." The only notification to those listeners was the occasional "It's a goof" mumbled at the start of the show. He discovered, however, that once listeners knew the truth, his show's ratings went up sharply, and he now discusses the behind-the-scenes details of his show more openly.  In 2005, he even engaged in several live "webcasts", where an admitted 15,000+ paid subscribers to his website could witness Hendrie doing the show on a video feed.

In February 2005, Hendrie's flagship station became XTRA Sports 570 (KLAC), deemed a better fit for his show's mostly male audience.  John Ziegler, a local Los Angeles conservative talk show host, moved into his slot on KFI.  .

On April 27, 2006, it was revealed that Hendrie would be leaving radio to pursue a career in television.  His last radio show was June 23, 2006.

He left this note on his web site June 25 2006 -- 

My brothers and sisters, 

What a great night Friday night was. We had a few tears. Bud belched. R.C. called in as he spanked the night away. It was a beautiful thing. All of the e-mail we have received tells us that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, no longer content to smile slightly at a nicely delivered line on "Two and A Half Men," or go "Oh, oh," at the network approved lesbian reference on "Joey." No, this is the new American, an American who demands the deep, pee-drenchment of the belly laugh, tears streaking, muscles gone, car into light pole. We have endeavored to bring you just that for over 16 years. With the shower of dung you face every day, you deserve it. By God, you will continue to get it. The effort does not end. It transmutes. It moves beyond radio now. It goes to the small and the large screen, God-willing. It will go into print. Wherever the body-convulsing, endorphin-releasing laugh is needed, we will go. You need it. I need it.

You see, it wasn't really about radio. It has always been about the laugh. The real gut laugh. The laugh that erupts so unexpectedly you break wind or drop hints of mud. Sure I put it crudely, but the laugh is not a judgment. The laugh knows no border or race or law. The laugh goes where it wants to and can be found anywhere at anytime. As we demonstrated on the radio show and will soon demonstrate elsewhere, the laugh may come barging into the home of a senior citizen, blind from glaucoma. (Harvey Weirman) It may be found at a barbecue gathering of recently released child-molesters (Herb Sewell) It might come creeping around the corner as a neighbor saws down another's treehouse, with a wheelchair-bound child inside (Steve Bosell) Or it might leap, gazelle-fashion, into a situation where a developmentally-disabled man crawls through a phone line to strangle and dismember a radio station program director. 

Thank the heavens for the laugh. As I grew up and came to love this honest, beautiful expression of truth, I swore an oath that I would seek its extremes, come what may, because in the end I knew it was a curative, a medicine, an elixir of such potency it could give us all a glimpse of immortality. There are a few experiences in life that enable us to lose all fear. One of them is when we are caught in the embrace of a brief-staining, spit-spewing, shrieking, strangling laugh that comes from the recognition of truth. 

I could go on, but why? You are here because you get it. Know that you are at the front. You are point men and women. There is no battle though. It is a march. It cannot be stopped. We now know that truth can be found in the pure laugh and as we tramp on, howling and wetting ourselves, others will join us until that day, that great day when we finally make the mental hook-up, the eye-opening deja vu that the laugh is, indeed, what separates us from the animal. And then we will know that animals are garbage that should be ground into sausage or stunned with prods until they too get with it finally and start........to laugh. 

Amen,

Show format.
When Hendrie has one of his "guests" on, the opening segment is usually cordial, and presents an unusual premise for discussion.  In the second segment, a new outrageous element is usually brought in to the ongoing discussion, and callers are introduced.  The callers are usually angry and outraged at what the guests are discussing, and the guest usually responds in a caustic manner. In the third segment, a third and final surprise enters the conversation and often a hilarious crescendo pitch is reached that leaves callers exhausted and enraged and listeners laughing. The caller and guest converse in downright bellicose tones, which often becomes a surreal good cop/bad cop routine as Hendrie hangs-up on his guest and apologizes to the caller.

Typically, two hours of the three hour show are devoted to character-based comedy segments, where the fake guests, voiced by Phil, interact with real callers. The remaining hour is devoted to Phil's commentary on the topics of the day, and to short comedy bits that could not occupy a full hour of the show. Sometimes, two hours are used for commentary and shorter bits, and only one hour of a fake guest is performed.  Hendrie's other segments include "How to Read a News Story," "Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell (a schtick on the real Art Bell)", "Phil's Mailbag," "Flashback Requests", "Bud Dickman's Radical NASCAR Accidents", "Phil Explains the Bullcrap with Frodo the Puppet," and "Life Imitates Phil," a segment where an outrageous stunt that had been invented on his program was later duplicated in real life. 

Phil is joined in the studio by Bud Dickman, a slightly mentally-retarded intern voiced in a relatively cartoonish Kermit the Frog-like tone by Hendrie.  According to the character's backstory, his brain damage is the result of a motorcycle accident that sent him head first through an oak tree near Ojai, California.  Bud often antagonizes Phil into beating him senseless or to the point of tears by making bad jokes, or ratting him out to programming director David G. Hall (a fictionalized version voiced by Hendrie) when the host says something that could be metaphor for sex or genitalia.  Hendrie has admitted on several occasions that this "sidekick" is something of a safety-net, bailing him out of long rants or unsuccessful bits.  At the same time, Bud has become one of the shows' most beloved characters, and there was a fan uproar when Phil "fired" him briefly in 2004.  Bud has also been "killed" at least once by Phil, only to reappear moments later saying he got better.

Often during some segments of the show, Hendrie provides his own personal opinions and commentary on his life, career, and various news stories. The number of these segments devoted to political commentary increased following the September 11, 2001 attacks, as he has become a staunch supporter of President Bush's war on terrorism.  A longtime Democrat and staunchly liberal on a number of issues, Hendrie has strongly voiced opposition to the Democratic Party as of late, accusing it of having lost touch with its core constituents and failing to adequately engage with a philosophy to win the war on terror. Beginning in January 2004, however, The Phil Hendrie Show decreased the number of "serious" segments in Hendrie's own voice and returned to the commentary-through-satire which originally made him famous.

Hendrie often promotes My Friend's Place, a resource center for homeless youth based in Hollywood, California, and donates all the proceeds from the sales of his "Best Of" CDs to the center.

"Guests".
The show featured dozens of recurring fictional personalities.  Some of the most popular ones include:

Austin Amarka.
Austin Amarka has made a lot of different incarnations on the Phil Hendrie Show. In one bit, he was a construction worker specializing in cabinets and can lights, and also works on cars.  He's an advocate of a conservation program called "Hunt and Release" (as opposed to the catch and release program from the sport of fishing) whereby a hunter just wounds the deer, then takes it to a veternarian to have the bullet or arrow removed and then releases it back into the wild.  He also enjoys the extreme sport of putting on a bulletproof vest, then donning a deer suit and running around in the forest so hunters can shoot at him.  A brusque arch-conservative, Amarka runs "Don't Mess With Texas", a fanatical pro-death penalty organization which holds fiestas and chili cookoffs when convicted murderers are executed in the Lone Star State.  He was even once a death row inmate who tried feigning mental retardation to escape the chair.  Austin is a 'white nationalist' but lately has been having second thoughts about the superiority of caucasians since a black gentleman beat him so badly at a Scrabble tournament.  Austin now owns a service station in Lancaster, California.  Austin is one of Phil's more versatile and diverse characters, making his precise identity difficult to describe (as it often changes depending on the bit).

Bob Bakian.
News helicopter reporter who reports on insane reactions from people after hearing celebrity gossip. Bob reported that "Michael Powell has resigned (from the FCC) so he can go on food stamps like other black people," and he was reprimanded along with Phil by David G. Hall for doing the same material twice. David G. Hall also instructs Bud Dickman to blast Bakian out of the sky for doing "schtick" such as when Korean scientists successfully cloned a dog and Bakian kept mispronouncing the scientist's names as "Yoo Suk Wang," "Swinging Wang," and "Wang Who Suk".

Aside from his schtick, Bakian seems to show an alarming tendency toward good old-fashioned ineptitude; he once mistook part of the downtown Los Angeles area as being flooded when, in actuality, his helicopter was simply over the Pacific Ocean.

Blaine Baxter.
Noted poet laureate beset by a "wandering eye" that typically "wonks" out whenever he reads a famous poem. His segments usually end in disaster when the audience (or Phil) get tired of his continual distractions.

Art Bell.
Real-life weekend host of syndicated on-air and Internet radio program Coast to Coast AM.  Hendrie lampoons him ("I have news out of NASA and it's shocking") from time to time.  Hendrie opens the segment with a parody of Ross Mitchell, Coast to Coasts opening announcer, repeating Hendrie's single call-in number of 800-449-8686 as opposed to Bell's multiple numbers (east of the Rockies, west of the Rockies, first time caller, and the wildcard line).  Theme music is "Dancing Queen" by ABBA, a song Bell himself often uses.  Art often advertises outlandish products from a fictitious sponsor, "Peenman Enterprises" ("But first, this from Peenman Enterprises"), selling things such as the "Earth Handle", the "Ass Wallet," the "Pubic Hair Straightener," and the "Human Waste Chili Maker."  A frequent guest of "Art's" is "General Johnson Jameson" who reports from his underground bunker "deep within the Saskatchewan Crust."  General Jameson is often accompanied by his hunchback, drug addicted assistant "Igor", and all of his bits inevitably end with a crude and tasteless fart joke. General Jameson and Art Bell seem to be friends outside of the show, having driven down to Area 51 and waking up having been probed and sodomized by aliens once. General Jameson was inspired by Art Bell's real guests, Richard C. Hoagland and Major Ed Dames.

The real Art Bell has stated on several occasions that he is not offended by these parodies, and in fact, is a huge fan of Phil Hendrie's show.

Ted Bell.
Egomaniacal owner of the upscale steakhouse Ted's of Beverly Hills,  one of Phil's "sponsors,"  with the motto, "We want to put our meat in your mouth" (the word "mouth" is now censored in light of recent FCC crackdowns, leading the song to sound even more vulgar).  Frequently interjects with "I'm Ted Bell" when speaking to the callers.  Has a chronic phobia of the disabled, and is president of the Beverly Hills Automobile Association. Inventor of the cocktail called a "Ted," simply the very common Rum and Coke.  His meals are outrageously overpriced, but Bell often brags that he was the first to put tinfoil on a baked potato, and that he invented the baked potato tree a wooden device, in the shape of a tree, on which baked potatoes are skewered so that patrons may select one and once in possesion can "Unzip it, and pull it out hot" for their dinner. Ted drives a McLaren SLR and often reminds callers that it cost him $400,000.  Ted stated that when he was 17 years old his father put a cashier's check in his account for $20 million.  Now, at the age of 40, he is proud to say that he is worth $25 million.

In 2005, Phil Hendrie pulled a Google bomb-type prank by creating tedsofbeverlyhills.com, which lists a fake address and phone number, causing the restaurant to become listed in numerous online restaurant guides for the Los Angeles area, including the Zagat's website.

"I'm not judgmental.  I'm Ted Bell.  I'm rich."

Logan Benson.
An infrequent caller to Phil's show, Logan is an eight-year-old child with dubious living conditions and guidance. His overbearing and controlling grandfather, "Papa Frank," lingers in the background and tells Logan what to say during his calls to Phil. A few examples of Logan's calls: " My grandpa says that its not fair that cripple in Florida gets more press than the chimp that ate the man's wiener," or "My grandpa says that Thanksgiving is a crock and we should have slaughtered the Indians right off the bat when we came." Logan is also told to drink some blue sparkling liquid glass cleaner by his grandpa.

Don Berman.
Don is a proud member of the "award-winning Channel 19 news team."  Often brought on the show to talk about current news events, his latest investigative stories, and other media-related topics.  Don's reports are frequently controversial, such as a special on teenage drinking and driving that, instead of simply discouraging the illegal act, advised minors on how to safely make their way home without police interference. Other members of the channel 19 news team include reporter Donna Decruz and meteorologist Goldie Showers.

Clara Bingham.
School administrator.  One of Pastor Rennick's (q.v.) flock in the "Joyful Union Congregation" of Bellflower, California. Now married to Pastor Rennick.  Clara once admitted to putting her underwear in the mouth of her pupils to prevent them from talking.  She was nice enough though to remove her "pad" she said. Clara is extremely liberal, often to the point of having downright bizarre viewpoints on mundane issues, and claims to have notoriety on several other radio shows as "The Angry Liberal".

Lloyd Bonafide.
73 year old Korean war veteran of the United States Navy, "fairly loyal" Glock gun owner, and RV enthusiast from Alhambra, California, Lloyd is a retired executive from a heating and plumbing business.  He has one daughter and one grandson.  Lloyd has a history of battle fatigue, and he lives his life "as if all hell is going to break loose at any moment."  No "turkey" shoud ever cut him off, and no "monkey" should ever lay a hand on him, which includes his 5 year old grandson. Lloyd also endangers his grandson by purposely keeping loaded handguns in his house when his grandson visits.  As he explains, "Any gun owner will tell you there's something about having a small child in the house and having a loaded weapon in the house that is a little bit of an adrenaline rush."  Even though this idea is absurd and criminal, Lloyd actually believes that doing so keeps him sharp and his senses focused, which as a result allows him to better raise his grandson.  Lloyd brings his Korean War experience into every facet of his life.  On several occasions when he was put on hold by Phil, Lloyd has managed apparently through sheer force of will to break off hold and get back on air without anyone taking him off hold. Recently, when on the air with Chris Norton, Mr. Bonafide revealed that he did stag films in the 1950s and was the original "Hugh G. Rection." 

Lloyd tells Phil "Well, that tears it!" when he gets frustrated.  When faced with a challenging caller, Lloyd has a tendency to refuse to listen to the caller unless the caller outranks him.

Lloyd operates his recreational vehicle between Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon once a year to visit his daughter.  He claims to have halogen lights on the roof of his Winnebago that are so powerful "you can see a man's skull."

Called Vernon Dozier in the last show.

Steve Bosell.
Emotionally fragile owner of B&B Construction of Corona, California and frequent (almost to the point of seeming vexatious) litigant, originally from Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  The "B&B" in his business name stands for "Bosell & Bosell."  Steve is not in business with his father, son, brother, uncle, or anyone else.  The "B&B" is supposed to represent the intensity he brings to his business:  "Bosell and Bosell yet again, just non-stop Bosell comin' at ya like a stampede of steer."   One of the show's most popular guests, Steve admits "weeping" at the slightest humiliation and frequently threatens to sue his wife for emotional trauma. Other common targets for Steve's lawsuits are his neighbor, Roy Hutchins (with whom he has some form of bizarre sexual tension) and a coworker, Cliff Pettigrew.  In all his litigation, Steve is assisted by longtime attorney Dolores Blasingame of Riverside, California.  Bosell reluctantly admits to having spent about $500,000 last year on litigation, most of it going to Ms. Blasingame.

Before Steve got into the construction business, he was a part-time stand-up comedian under the moniker Super Steve McFunny. Not being very humorous, his stand-up acts were often heckled, to which Steve would reply "Oh yeah? Well you smell like tuna."

Steve is married with two children, all of which, at one point or another, have been sued by Steve himself. His wife is April Bosell, while his two children are Steve Junior and April Junior.

Phil did a Steve bit during the first hour of his last show.

Colleen Kristin Brewster.
Travel agent and young businesswoman.  She has "tragically hip" fashion sense (think banana yellow pantsuit) and is an all-around slut. This character was difficult for Phil to perform and no longer appears on the show.

Darren Browne.
The General Manager of the Air America Radio affiliate in Pierre, South Dakota which carries the Phil Hendrie Show. Bud Dickman hates him for "talking weird" and ends up going through the phone and killing him every time he is on. Hendrie has voiced the character of Darren Browne under the name Vic Prell from his Miami days and early days on KFI.

Rudy Canoza.
Amorous Argentine lingerie store owner. His fictional boutique is called "Je T'aime Lingerie" in Sherman Oaks, California. Known for his sexual come-on, "la-la-la-la-la," which he claims is used by all Argentine men. Rudy has a foghorn installed at Je T'aime Lingerie to alert him or one of his employees when a "fat" woman (bigger than size 10), or when a short woman, enters his store. A recent addition has been a gong installed in Je T'aime Lingerie to alert Rudy when a "Jap" enters his store because they counterfeit his designs when they take pictures in the store.

Canoza is known to juxtapose his 'la-la-la-la-la' with popular (Sometimes even Christmas music; see 'Deck the Halls') music to allure the women.

When was your last pork chop inhalation?

Chef Carl Chodillia.
An infrequent character, Chef Carl is a cooking show host whose unbelievable girth prevents him from speaking into the microphone for more than a few seconds, after which he wheezes uncontrollably.  His rambling and pointless recipes always call for excessive amounts of fat and sugar.  Phil pledged to depose of Chef Carl as a sponsor after the presentation of his "Deep-Fried Kid" recipe.  Chef Carl sounds remarkably like Roland Schwinn.

R.C. Collins.
One of Hendrie's most popular characters, Collins is a young pubescent cadet attending "Bradley Military Academy" in Altadena, California. R.C. has a very long story arc that has stretched for many years. The character actually "died" of a rare kidney disease in 1998 but was found alive and well at a KFI "Radio in the Park" event several weeks later.  At the time, R.C. was a Satan-worshipping goth since he claimed that "Jesus didn't give him a good kidney."  He was a popular student who played high school basketball while wearing a top hat, a black cape (with "R.C." embroidered in red letters) and while carrying a staff.  

R.C. has had his share of medical problems while living with his mother, who was always drunk and passed out and not a part of his home life.  He lost a testicle as a result of the loss of his kidney, thus suffering for years afterward with "phantom nut." He now has a prosthetic left testicle. R.C. had a short stint on air working for Phil doing "The Force Report" with Bud Dickman before the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.  The pair mostly got in trouble and took drugs and rarely had anything to say about either the Star Wars movie or the fans waiting outside the "Chinese Man" Theater.  R.C. and Bud were also allowed to host their own bowling tournament, which they named "The Spooge Demon Open."

A former student of Chatsworth High School, R.C. now attends Bradley Military Academy under the watchful eye of Commandant Harvey Wireman, R.C. has no contact with his mother but expects "father to send for him" at any moment to be shop foreman in his dad's factory.  Always image conscious, R.C. refuses to ride in the dilapidated automobiles of his friends, referring to them as "beaner-mobiles."  R.C. will often include his friend Chris Sorensen in his exploits.  As a side note, R.C. was also a small character during Phil's employment in Miami; then he was known as R.C. Cabetti.  RC often began to talk about the bowler, Ben Laughlin when people mentioned the name of Osama bin Laden

Comb-Over Boy.
A send-up of talk show host Tom Leykis, with whom Hendrie has a long-standing rivalry (both hosts chide each other on their respective programs, seemingly without any goodwill).  He recently "killed" himself due to the fact that he "sucks" and "is ugly."  However, Comb-Over Boy has made a comeback as of late.

Doug Dannger.
Newspaper columnist of the fictitious Orange County Courier.  Since coming out as a homosexual, he frequently proclaims his status as "a gay man and a gay journalist," although the proclamation is rarely relevant to the discussion at hand.  In many of his confrontations, Doug claims he will go "eyeball to eyeball" with the caller, even if one of the two of them has to use a shoebox to level off.  He declares as the number one movie of the millennium, The Shaggy D.A., a Disney flick from the '70s.

Whenever someone disagrees with Doug, he insists it must be because of their homophobia.  

Among his many assertions, Doug believes that gay journalists, himself in particular, should be trusted with national secrets since they've already proven they can keep a secret for a long period of time.

"I'm a gay man and a gay journalist because I was born that way."

Joe Dickhead and the Professor.
Joe Dickhead and the Professor do a sports show from "high atop the Las Vegas strip" where they make NFL picks but they are always doing something else while giving the picks, like playing marco polo or getting a root canal. Their picks are always wrong and sometimes have nothing whatsoever to do with football.

Previously, these bits were performed every Friday (except on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving) during the NFL season. However as of last year, Joe and the Professor's NFL picks have occurred less often.

Bud Dickman.
"Bud" is a producer, sidekick, intern, and call screener during the show. The victim of a motorcycle accident sixteen years earlier in Ojai, California -- which caused him to have a steel plate inserted into his head -- Bud is employed on the show to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Bud usually gets into trouble on the air (and sometimes off-the-air as well). On most occasions, if Phil may say something on-air that might be remotely suggestive, Bud will typically notify Phil's "vice president of syndication," David G. Hall, who usually errs on Bud's side. Bud is also the heir to millions of dollars on account of Mini Dickmann's Candy that is popular in Germany. Bud does not like black people because they scare him but Bud thinks his black football player buddy Lance is OK because, "he's a football player," and his girlfriend (a UPS driver) is black but Bud thinks she's OK because, "she's beautiful!" Phil often points out Bud's contradictions when it comes to race but Bud never seems to comprehend. Bud speaks cantonese when ordering Chinese food and apparently, "clang," means, "I'm out," in cantonese.

Bud was named "Dave Del Weygan" when Phil was on in Ventura. Phil has said on the air that Bud is a crutch he leans on for, "comic relief during rant hours," and when Bud was briefly fired Phil said to a voice he made up, "I gotta stand on my own two feet."

Bud occasionally goes "through" the phone line and kills annoying guests. Especially C-93 program director Darren Brown.

Perhaps Bud Dickman's finest moment came when Phil fired him on the air. Phil explained that Bud was too cartoonish, and that he had bombed big-time at a recent live taping of the show. Bud started crying and left the studio after calling Phil a "prick." Hendrie was deluged with emails demanding that he reinstate Bud, and eventually he got back on the show after VP of syndication David G. Hall interceded on his behalf. 

"Me me like the Phil Hendrie Show." (describing Phil's show in seven words or less)

Bobbie Dooley.
Officious president of the gated community "Western Estates Homeowners' Association" of Westlake Village, California, president of her PTA, and arguably the show's most popular character.   

Husband "Steve Dooley" is the vice-president of Western Estates who frequently cuts in on conversations with pointless, drunken statements, usually supporting his wife. Steve is always referred to by Bobbie as "My husband" and is always described as the "owner of a wildly successful landscaping business." "Bobbie" makes a trademark, repeated "mmmmmmmm hmmmmmmm" noise when listening to the callers, which almost always annoys them, and is reminiscent of a former colleague of Mr. Hendrie's. Her father was a circus clown and her mother a prostitute.  Hendrie often does "Best of Bobbie Dooley" shows during holiday periods. Mrs. Dooley calls the program frequently to espouse her upper-class, soccer-mom viewpoints which are often little more than her husband Steve's opinions, who can be heard in the background coaching her. 

Bobbie and Steve are obsessed with "being young", "hip", and "with it" -- which apparently accounts for the wild parties they throw for minors. Steve enjoys hanging out in the hot tub with his son and all his friends, then jumping out to reveal that he has been naked from the waist down. Bobbie assures listeners it was hilarious when Steve screamed "The Cobra is out of the cage!" Bobbie enjoys her "youngness" as well, and is known to teach girls how to commit sodomy so as to improve their sex life. 

Bobbie Dooley is also on the committee and spokeswoman for the fall-tacular, winter-tacular, spring-tacular, and summer-tacular fashion shows. On occasion, Bobbie sings offkey songs on the show because she used to be a professional singer by the name of Yvonne Elleman who sang with Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blue Oyster Clut before going solo to sing on the soundtrack for Saturday Night Fever. According to Bobbie, Mr. Stigwood wanted a more ecclectic feel to the soundtrack and thought an image of a, "china woman," would be preferred to the anglo look of the Bee-Gees and that one of the Bee-Gees looked as though his head was pinched in at birth. Bobbie is fiercely protective of all of her three sons, especially her 15-year old oldest child Seth. Seth has been accused of date-rape by a girl Bobbie calls a "slut", has been discovered "messing around" with another boy in his car, and crashed into a bunch of disabled kids picnicking in a park next to a highway. Bobbie often grows hysterical about issues, especially those regarding her sons. She needed to take pills after watching  an A&E special on Hitler and fearing that the Boy Scout Camp her children attend may be some kind of Nazi organization. Bobbie is usually a hard-core Republican, but switched sides on the Iraq war after she attended a Hollywood Peace March and spoke with Mike Farrell and Uma Thurman.

Bobbie Dooley was Phil's personal favorite character to perform. On his last broadcast, he confessed that much of Bobbie Dooley was based on his own mother.

"I once wore pants to church four Sundays in a row.  If that's not a lesbian I don't know what one is."

Jeff Dowder.
A stoner, a drummer in the band "Darkhorse" (aka Darque Hoarse) and Professor of Mechanical Physics at Caltech. Jeff is based on real-life pal "Sundown" from Hendrie's days in Miami and Minneapolis. Jeff is advocate of the medical use of marijauna. He often demonstrates his drumming live on the air, usually incorporating various "jazz modalities"; he frequently pauses for bong hits.  Jeff has a friend named Toby Beau and has mentioned the name of another friend, Hobie Bunson, at least once. (Jeff has also been known, in at least one bit, as Dr. Jeff Raley.)

Once did a semi-regular technology segment, The Jeff Dowder Compooter Show , where he would talk about the important aspects of eLifestyle; porn surfing, living in one's mother's basement, never taking a shower, giving up a spouse or loved one to play with programs such as ProTools and the best kinds of junk food to eat while going to sites such as the "Chicks with Big Butts Message Board".

Vernon Dozier.
High school football coach, math, history, and social sciences teacher, and all-around tough guy who tends to be attracted to his underage female students.  He has come under fire for allowing girls to wear thong bikinis to class, commenting suggestively on their appearances, and expressing his desire to propose to one of his students during her graduation.  Dozier will do anything to improve his win-loss record, including spiking his players' drinks with steroids.  Despite his established fondness for teenage girls, he has also implied some homosexual tendencies - he was once caught going into a gay bar with another coach who was dressed in drag.  Vernon swears it was the coach's ugly twin sister, and they only went into the gay bar to dance. Vernon comes on to his female students because his wife is suffering from an unknown affliction which makes her sound like Linda Blair in the Exorcist. Vernon has said, "I spent the past seven years trying to get through to her, now I'm going to spend the next seven years trying to keep her locked up."

Before his football days, Vernon recently revealed that he was a jazz musician, who played the saxophone. Before "giving himself to god" as he puts it, he wrote the song Watermelon Man, in reference to the stereotype that African Americans eat a lot of watermelons, of which Vernon disagrees with -- despite him using the terms "spook" and "spade" very freely around African American jazz players. Vernon carries a lot of baggage from his parents. His mother drove him to football practice which caused the coach to taunt Vernon with, "look at Momma boy," and, "somebody get that boy a bib." Vernon's mother was also a drunk who in any given night would have a member from each branch of the armed forces in her bed and she would yell out, "Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines!" As such Vernon forbids his players from being dropped off by their mothers as well as having PUSSY diseases such as asthma. Vernon's father was an alcoholic who cried on a regular basis and Vernon as a young man vowed to never cry no matter what. To test this part of his character, Vernon went into an all-black bar in Eatonville, Florida wearing mirrored shades and a Hawaiian shirt with a shaved head, held up a Marlboro Red cigarette and said, "Do any of you boogies have a light?" As six guys kicked his ass, Vernon laughed all the way through it, even though he still sees, "tomato bisque," in the toilet every morning. He continues to enjoy laughing through pain while his wife drives a Cadillac Escalade over his hand and the team mascot, a mule, kicks him, "square in the royal American."

Vernon received legendary status when he took part in the extremely popular "Plane Go Boom" bit, in which he trains a retarded boy named Bobby via cattle prod in the field of airport security. In Phil's own list of the top 100 bits of 2002, this was voted number 1.

Played a part in the final show.

"Pile it high and deep."

Dr. Dean Edell.
Real-life radio talk show doctor. Phil lampoons him and his hair, a persistent '70s-style perm.

Raj Fahneen.
Raj is an Egyptian and Phil's first "guest," performed during the first Gulf War to incite people to call in. Raj believed that the solution to the Kuwait crisis was to have President George Bush wash the feet of Saddam Hussein.  He was also known as Hamid during Phil's employment in Minneapolis. Raj has a difficult time grasping the intricacies of American culture ("you mean it's not okay to wipe my dog's ass with the American flag!?"). He often tells callers to "shut your mouth," calls people he dislikes "bastards", uses the term "Jesus" often (which offends Christian callers), and accuses native-born American citizens of knowing more about offerings at fast food restaurants than they do about their own Constitution. Raj is famous for relentlessly asking Phil's callers, "Do you Super-Size?"  Another famous bit he does is one where he sings with his "son" a song to the tune of Elvis Presley's "Blue Suede Shoes":

Raj:  All Americans are big fat hogs, they eat a Big Mac and shoot out a log, oh yeah.

Son:  Uh-huhhh.

Raj:  Oh, yeah.

Son:  Uh-huhhh.

Raj:  Aye!

Margaret Gray.
This character "writes" a celebrity newspaper column called "A Little Bird Told Me;" overbearing mother of child actor Jason Jay Delmonico, so named after Margaret saw a package of Delmonico steaks in the supermarket. Margaret wrote a column about how she has been sleeping with her son ever since the "traumatic events" of the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake.  Margaret tends to incite callers by blaming any and all of the world's ills on President Bush.  She has often "died" in airstrikes called in by Mr. Hendrie when he disagrees with her commentary.  She was known as Margaret Selb while Phil was employed in Minneapolis; she was married to Roland Selb, who Phil later split into two characters, Don Berman and Roland Schwinn.  In Miami, she was known as Margaret from Bal Harbor.

Frank Gray.
Margaret's husband, who has become a more common character lately. He is an elderly, wheelchair-bound, Cutty Sark-blended scotch drinker who can never find ice, and has trouble using the pronouns he/she/him/her/etc. i.e. "My wife Margaret, he's a real ball-breaker." (Frank) Is quoted saying, "Do you now Al Hert? (Phil) Yea I know him, a she right? (Frank) Hey Margaret this jackass thinks the Al Hurt is a she." (Margaret) He always gets the whole gender thing confused."

Every time Phil greets Frank and asks him how he is doing, he will consistently respond with "Well Phil, I'm vertical"

The gender confusion was given an entirely new dimension of complexity when it was revealed that homosexuals were referred to in the 'proper' gender.  An example would be: "Elton John, he's a real piece of work, but Marlon Brando... she was really something else in On the Waterfront."

Some of Frank's other accomplishments: wrote Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head; was the original voice of Mr. Ed; was the first athlete pictured on a Wheatees box; taught Gene Simmons from Kiss how to spit blood; coached Marlon Brando in The Score; and rode Seattle Slew to four victories.

Bob Green.
Owner and CEO of the Southern California grocery store chain Frazier Foods and owner of a $20,000 hair system (He insists it is NOT a toupee; "When you think of someone with hair, think of me: Bob Green."). Bob frequently invades into the lives of his employees and seems to have a lot of trouble as an employer. He also has difficulty when it comes to charity, creating programs for hot-button causes and then complaining when it doesn't positively impact his business. Bob Green is modeled after a real person, who was station manager at WIOD during Phil's stint in Miami. He currently owns twenty-four stores.

Bob is an old fashioned grocier who doesn't believe in health or natural food stores such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.  In fact, he believes that these store deceive their customers about the food they sell.  He recently made the argument that, even if advertised as such, no store can sell free range chicken.  He explained: "It's impossible.  A chicken to be free range?  You can't have any fences.  In other words, to get that chicken to market, you have to get in a jeep and you have to drive the length of your farm and find it because you've allowed it to just go wherever the hell it wants to go.  I don't go in for that.  I don't buy from people like that."

Bob also believes that plastic bags are better for the environment than paper bags because he saw it on TV. Bob loves publicity.  He was taking 8 tons of goods to the Katrina victims, including hotdog relish, spatulas, beets and party hats, but was mad that no media reported on his good deed.  His mom always said, "Give what you can give."

Bob is also well-known for sexually harassing his female workers and customers (e.g., taking pictures of them in the produce aisle holding cucumbers, zucchini, etc.) and is notorious for telling his customers what they can and cannot buy (e.g., he won't sell corn on the cob to people with crooked teeth because of the image of the corn getting stuck in their teeth). Bob is on a protocol of tranquilizers and hot tub treatments because of having to look at his wife's relatives, who have poor dental care, eating corn on the cob.

Arguably, Bob's most famous segment was before syndication when Phil was still on WIOD in Miami. During this bit, Phil tricked the actual Larry King into calling up and arguing with Bob.

Tell the lesbians that Bob Green's coming, and Hell follows.

Art Griego.
Commercial/private pilot with a fear of flying, good friend of D.B. Cooper and a former minor league first baseman for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Art first appeared while Phil was employed in Miami as Steve Nichol, who was program director at WIOD at the time. On KFI, he phoned Phil from high above Los Angeles in a single engine Cessna 177 completely drunk to explain why pilots should be allowed to drink while flying. He then stalled (and recovered) the aircraft several times and got several panicked real pilots to call in and explain the dire situation to Phil and the listeners.

Larry Grover.
Former president of the Conservatives of Kern County; currently lives on the service porch of his mother's home.  His marriage fell apart while he was devoting his every waking minute to getting President Bill Clinton impeached. Enjoys good, clean, Christian sex, which according to Larry, requires partners to be fully clothed (except for certain strategic areas), plastic wrap, and use of various household cleansers for clean-up.  Larry's mother often intrudes on his conversations with Phil to supply embarrassing information about her son such as his possession of a magazine entitled "Women Who Love Horses".

David G. Hall.
Phil's overbearing boss based on his program director at KFI.  Now, "Hall" is usually referred to as "vice president of syndication."  Always having "the hot seat dusted off" for him by his superiors when it appears he can't control Phil's show. "Darth" Hall's appearances are now heralded by The Imperial March from the Star Wars films. When Phil mentions something that has the faintest possibility of alluding to genitalia, Hall will often be notified by Phil's assistant Bud Dickman.

Hall is always calling Hendrie on the air and giving him orders on how to improve his ratings -- such as acting gay, saying that he's single, or singing. Hall is also known to call in and convince Phil of something completely false, such as when he called and said that he had anthrax, or that he was gay and dating someone on the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hall called Phil up on Phil's 30th anniversary in radio to fire him and replace him with brain-damaged intern Bud Dickman.

Kyle Holster.
A massage therapist/chiropractor that comes in every now and then to give Phil a massage or even put Phil's neck back into place with the force of his own body.

Cowboy Jim.
Cowboy Jim is the host of a live children's TV show, ala Captain Kangaroo. All skits seem to end with Cowboy Jim being hit in the 'scrotillia', or killed.

Paul "Tubby" Lane.
From the rural South, Paul Lane is a NASCAR and sometime SCCA racing veteran.  He has a phobia about speed, which he uses as an excuse for his poor driving abilities.  Paul tends to offend Southerners in particular with his gay-oriented ideas of how to promote NASCAR, including "Dinner With a Driver" in which a fan can enjoy dinner, nighttime beach walks, and a shower with their favorite driver.  He first appeared while Phil was employed in Miami as a frequently used character named Steve Wornell.  

Paul was once involved in a race situation in which he jettisoned a baby seat with a Cabbage Patch doll in it out of his vehicle.  The driver whose car it hit drove off the speedway, collided with a police car, and was killed.  Paul believes this occurred not because of the recklessness of the joke, but because the driver was inexperienced, was frightened by the upturn nose of the Cabbage Patch doll, was driving a Chevy, and was basically ready to kill himself.  In Paul's own words, "I don't think it's a moment where you actually celebrate life when you say 'there's a Cabbage Patch looking at me and I'm in a Chevy.'"

Mavis Leonard.
Elderly African-American woman similar to Clara Bingham.  Mavis often has trouble with her nephew Robert and is fond of singing old Negro spirituals.

Mavis called Phil to tell him that she was eating cat food after she was scammed out of her retirement money by a company claiming to offer vacations on Johnny Depp island.  

Mavis also drinks Henry Weinhards beer and was the guest in the legendary 'All You can Eat Negro' bit, which to this day -- according to Phil --  remains the single most requested bit on Phil's show

Hal and Viola Levolier.
This semi-wealthy retired couple are always in their private plane listening to Phil whom they absolutely adore   while flying to the only place they ever seem to go   Laughlin, Nevada.  Continually fighting each other for control of the plane's telephone, the couple invariably stalls the aircraft and they "die" in a crash after each appearance. Hal frequently shouts out, "You WHORE!," as the plane crashes because Viola forgot to fill the jet with gas.

Bob McGraw.
Bob is always on with some insane money-making scheme, like the Flight 93 Kit, containing nerve gas antidote. Not a major character, but quite funny. Arguably his most memorable scheme involved charging $10 to sodomize an effigy of Osama bin Laden at a Christmas tree lot.

Father James McQuarters.
Irish Catholic priest who comments on current events in a lilting brogue that occasionally drops to a rather dark, threatening register.  Almost always appearing with Celtic music, if Phil fails to loop the track then McQuarters transitions from his Irish accent to one of an older African American. Father McQuarters is known to drink while on air, usually taking a "snort" of Maker's Mark or Johnnie Walker, eventually drinking himself to an unintelligible state. Recently, Father McQuarters voiced that he thought he "had a shot at being Pope."

Father McQuarters caused a stir when he put forth the revolutionary idea that Adam and Eve were children in the book of Genesis.  To promote this idea and to prove that not all Catholic Priests are child molesters, Father McQuarters was attempting to put on a school play featuring second, third, and fourth graders as Adam and Eve "in the glory of their nakedness."

Father McQuarters was remanded by his Diocese for lying to protect some of the priests he knew who were accused of child molestation.  He defended his actions by saying, "It's very difficult to give up your friends.  Guys that you sit around and share a glass with.  Guys that understand your language, speak your lingo."  And after all, as Father McQuarters stated in a separate segment, some guys are just "born to be wild."

Father McQuarters is often known to associate with a fellow priest, Father Staley, who has been known to take a hit of the Christian Brothers port and grind out a few organ tunes once "word came down" from the Vatican that celebration was in order (due to such things as the child molestation charges being off the front page headlines).

Justin McElroy.
A high school student whom thinks he is smarter than every caller.  He bags on almost every caller.  He starts most sentences with the word "Well." Also use the word "um." He is also the president of the student body.  He disdains the opinions of adults and authority figures and often uses logical fallacies to support his position. He considers his mother and her friends "suburban sex pigs".

Colonel Buck Negro.
Buck is a parody of the majority of conservative radio hosts in the country; not only Rush Limbaugh as some have asserted. He has opinions as "rock solid as the Rock of Gibraltar" but is actually very easily convinced and swayed.

Chris Norton.
"Sessy" ("sexy" to you and me due to the character's speech impediment) telemarketer and an aspiring porn actor and producer.  He claims to have slept with "thousands and thousands and millions of women."  Chris has a good friend and business manager named Lance Germane. Their exploits typically have strong homosexual overtones, but Chris is always oblivious to this. He has trouble pronouncing "x" sounds (which sometime infuriates Phil), like when he talks about "the sissies" ('60's), "sessuality" (sexuality), being "essited" (excited), how women "can't resist his sess" or how he looks good in a "tuss," you know, "a tussedo." Frequently breathes heavily while masturbating (usually blames the problem on a sinus or breathing condition which he can't help) when women are on the air.

Before becoming a telemarketer, Chris Norton was manager of Huge Enterprises, an adult film industry, of which he starred in a number of films under his screen name Woody Wilson. He claims to have the largest collection of adult films on the West Coast.  This has not been confirmed.

Chris also runs the website "Fox Feaver" which is pornographic in nature. 

Chris can usually be found working "copyrighted" dance moves at the Rusty Pelican in Redondo Beach California.

Owner of the largest collection of adult films on the "wess coass"

Dave Oliva.
An aspiring latino LAPD officer and resident of Monterey Park, CA who frequently berates older people. Owner of a Chevy El Camino with tuck-and-roll seats, Chi Chi balls in the mirror, "Mambo #5" printed on the rear window, and a "Tell her she's Lovely" bumber sticker.  

Dave often asks Phil or his callers "How do you like me now?"

Dave is very dedicated to becoming an LAPD officer, doing such things as watching 'Cops' and gory slasher movies without blinking to toughen himself up for "the realities of the street," that he will eventually have to face as a police officer.  He often uses his "police training" to obtain compliance from customers at his workplace (e.g., using his police command voice to get others to clean off their plates at the restaurant for which he waiters).

Earl Pants.
This character owns and operates "Earl Pants' Automotive."  Earl hosts "Earl Pants Car Talk" live in Phil's studio, where he never gives any real advice.  He, in fact, often shows a complete lack of mechanical knowledge, even going so far as to change a tire with his chest positioned directly under the car's wheel (which promptly crashed down and trapped him under a "big, thick Firestone meat" when his son, afflicted with ADHD, released the car jack while he was working).

Jared Parker.
A born-again elder in the FLDS Church, he practices polygamy and has several wives, including two sixteen-year-old girls.  Although he does not believe in abuse, he does have a "discipline shed" for his wives.

Don Parsley.
Self-serving charlatan Don Parsley frequently calls Phil's show with various, disingenuous money making schemes.  In the wake of any natural disaster or terrorist attack, Phil takes a call from a gentleman named Don Parsley who claims to have lost his wife in the tragedy. Don claims to not take charity, but often accepts Phil's offer to solicit contributions from the listeners, if only for Don's children.  As the segment progresses, Don will decline all offers of assistance that are not cash money, or decline offers of cash less than $100, he will forget his wife's name, the names and number of his children, and generally reveal himself to be a complete fraud.  On occasion, he has also appeared to promote equally dubious products or services, about which he refuses to reveal any specific information.  He then forgets and contradicts himself about the details he has divulged, which appear to have been made up on the spot.

Chris Pootay.
Host of "Chris Pootay's Love Songs."  A radio show that loved ones can call in and dedicate a song.  The callers are mostly loners.

Pastor William Rennick.
Boisterous African American Pentecostal minister from the Joyful Union Congregation in Bellflower, California. Husband to Clara Bingham, they both enjoy whirlwind vacations in the Holy Land using the church's money. Pastor Rennick is also known to dance to such songs as Rick James' 'Give it to Me' and Hot Chocolate's 'Sexy Thing' on the top of his car, and was known once to be 'straight bashed' when he, in his Porsche Carrera GT, was beaten by "a hammasexual" wearing "leather chaps, a leather vest with no shirt on and one of those leather Nazi Germany hats" driving a souped up Corvette.  When the Pastor was beaten in the race, he refused to sign over the car's pink slip (for vehicle ownership, which he had wagered on the race), stating that "I ain't givin' no tailgunner no pink slip!", resulting in the Corvette driver assaulting Rennick and slamming his head into the door of his Porsche. Rennick's frequent exclamation "sweet, feathery Jesus!" lent the Phil Hendrie fansite sweetfeatheryjesus.com its name.

Pastor Rennick has been known to misappropriate church funds to benefit himself, resulting in extravagant purchases, such as cars, vacations (i.e. "a whirlwind trip to the holy land") and hot tubs.

The Pastor Rennick character has brought Phil some criticism for being racially insensitive.

Brad Rifkin.
A sleazy businessman who comes on the show to promote questionable advertising campaigns and fundraisers.  During the Terri Schiavo controversy, Brad created a billboard for a bottled-water company which featured the slogan, "blink if you're thirsty."  This character was named Brad "The Booger" Bellmante on Phil's WIOD Miami Show.  Brad "The Booger" hosted the "Beloved Buffalo Bills Report" and would often draw the ire of fans of the hometown Dolphins by insisting that the Dolphins "stink".  He once reported that Dan Marino had died because "he got the gout".

When the BTK Killer was captured, Brad promoted a line of clothes for overweight children called "BTK"  (Big Tall Kid).  The logo is a boy being choked to death, which he says is an allusion to "peacefully" euthanizing an ill and suffering child.  According to Brad, this is to represent the peace and relief that overweight children will receive from his plus-size clothing.

Dr. Jim Sadler.
He is a veterinarian, dentist, and psychiatrist. In recent years, Dr. Sadler has been working out (often in a thong in his front yard for all the neighbors to see), so as to better to "oil up" and intimidate others with how ripped he is. He often threatens physical violence on callers who disagree with him or informs them that they wouldn't dare say such things in front of him because he is so "ripped."  Dr. Sadler is at least fifty years old, and is married to a twenty-year-old woman. His voice (stereotypical Jewish New Yorker) seems to be loosely based on two strange characters that Phil did before his employment in Los Angeles:  Brad from his Minneapolis employment and Rick Seiderman from his Miami employment.

Jay Santos.
"Brigadier Admiral" in the Citizens' Auxiliary Police (motto: "We Take a Peek Over the Shoulder of the Police") of Hawthorne, California (originally from Philadelphia).  He was coereced into joining when his soon-to-be fellow Auxillary Policeman Major Elvis Newton came to him in a dream. His uniform consists of a blue arm band, a pith helmet, Bermuda shorts, and Doc Marten wingtips.  An overbearing, officious "rent-a-cop," Santos' motto and excuse for his behavior is "It's About Saving Lives," which he will go about doing even as he perverts the concept of citizen's arrest beyond recognition and taking it completely out of context (Jay believes that the legal right to citizen's arrest gives him arrest privileges beyond even that of accredited law enforcement agencies).  When confronted by callers that he is a police "wanna-be," Jay merely states that he is not in accredited law enforcement because there are "too much politics."  A cacophony of police scanners can be heard in the background whenever Jay phones in.

The "life saving" duties of the Citizen's Auxiliary Police include arbitrarily frisking teenage girls at shopping malls (ostensibly to prevent shoplifting), stopping white motorists to inspect their nostrils for methamphetamine as they are "mountain trash," making sure that men hanging around swimming pools aren't putting any inappropriate visual images in the "spank bank", and conducting mandatory gynecological exams on female motorists -- because distraction due to vaginal irritation might result in a car crash.  Jay's shining moment of vigilanteism came when he prevented large men from "lifting up a tricycle and trying to sniff the seat" at a garage sale.

According to Santos, the garage sale, yard sale is the pit of evil in America.  Jay says that, if after questioning a citizen, he can find no evidence of wrong-doing then "it's a tip of the hat, and I'm on my way."

Jay gets his marching orders from Major Elvis Newton, commanding officer of the Citizens' Auxiliary Police.  According to Jay, Newton is blind and reclusive. Consultations with him always seem to take place in Newton's darkened livingroom, where only the blue glow of a television and a wisp of cigarette smoke may be seen, Jay "sits at his feet," hanging on every word of his deranged directives.

Roland Schwinn.
Morbidly obese at 5'11" and 395 pounds, Schwinn is also a nudist. Owns and operates "Camp Bountiful" where kids can eat all the junk food they want without feeling guilty.  Has also been called Roland Selb and Roland Grey.

Herb Sewell.
Criminally insane individual rehabilitated after an eight year stay in the California state mental hospital in Atascadero.  Herb comes on Phil's show to comment on high-profile criminal cases.  He frequently punctuates his commentary with fits of nervous laughter, which in turn unnerves the callers.  Although Herb is an admitted child molester, he will remind people: "I did not commit the act of murder like some of the people I know, some of the people I'm very close to." One of those people is Walter Bellhaven, still at Atascadero, whom Sewell mentions very frequently.  Walter has murdered 150 men, women, and children according to the police, was convicted of 20 of those murders in a court of law, and is a great conversationalist, botanist and card player in Herb's estimation. 

Herb, like many of Hendrie's characters, has developed over time, and his being a criminally convicted child molester is a fairly recent twist. He has also developed a nervous laugh, of which he'll uncotrollably go into when talking about his perverted past. This "laugh" of his, has proven to be very effective as it ultimately freaks out the caller. Herb, a convicted sex offender, often calls from high risk situations such as carnivals or city parks and can often be heard talking to children in the background.

Previously, he was merely rich and deluded (a la Ted Bell and Bobbie Dooley) with a penchant for teenage girls. He later developed into someone who pushed his wife out of a car going ninety miles an hour on the California Grapevine, while his children watched.  The newer, more extreme incarnation of Sewell has become one of the show's most popular characters.

Skippy and Frank.
A parody of Opie and Anthony and other morning-show FM DJ's, Skippy and Frank are two morning "shock jocks" who are invariably fired from their jobs at the ends of their segments for doing outrageous and downright stupid "radical" stunts. Such a stunt occurred on the Valentine's Day edition of Skippy and Franky, where Skippy blew half of his entire face off when sticking a gun in his mouth and trying to see if he could pull the trigger with his toes (February 9, 2000).

Unable to land jobs in major radio markets, their "show" originates from some of America's most rural markets, each one a little smaller than the last.

Going from job to job with Skippy and Frank is their traffic reporter Commander Bud Hall, who always gets taunted by Skippy and Frank because his name sounds like "butt-hole." Fed up with the emotional distress and verbal abuse caused by the two, Bud Hall somehow managed to get to Skippy and Frank's studio from his helicopter in under fifteen seconds, and murdered the both of them.

Tsunami Sam.
A blues singer who sings songs that Phil interrupts because they are inappropriate (i.e. "The Candy Man" in memory of Pope John Paul II).  Sam always shoots back that he's being interrupted and/or forcibly removed from the studio because he's black.

Elliot Vaneer.
A disc jockey at a radio station that plays old musical hits from older artists like Eartha Kitt, Tony Bennett, Jack Jones, and many other older '50s-'60s music.  Vaneer claims to be very lonely and hate his life and he repeatedly kills himself with a shotgun and comes back when Phil begins to start talking again.  Elliot Vaneer is not a common "guest" but he appears every now and then to play some of the "big hits" for about 10 minutes.

"Brass" Villanueva.
A proud, young Latino from East Los Angeles ("mi barrio") who claims that he's not allowed to speak Spanish because he's "oppressed" by the Anglo culture, though Brass is invariably clueless about particulars of his own heritage.  Obsessed with neck tattoos.  Recently, Brass invented the Zapata Tube after receiving CPR due to near-drowning at a local beach.  His girlfriend accused him of being homosexual because another man placed his mouth on his.  Brass' skewed sense of honor compelled him to return to the beach and spit in the eye of the lifeguard who saved him.  The "Zapata Tube" (a CPR mask with a 3 foot tube) was proposed as a "non-gay" method of resuscitating a Latino.

Dean Wheeler.
New-age, Birkenstock-wearing, America-hating, yoga-teaching apologist from a Northern California political activist group.  In a previous incarnation, he was the spokesman of the Kentucky Tobacco Growers' "Tobaccy Truck" which allowed kids under the age of 18 to get free "tobaccy" if they had consent of any adult, even Mr. Wheeler.  During the first year of the Iraq war, Mr. Wheeler was known for trying to flee to Canada and is often portrayed as a fearful, sniveling individual.

Harvey Wireman, Esq..
World War Two veteran and a retired lawyer; he occasionally acts as Steve Bosell's attourney for his many lawsuits.  Wireman is commandant of Bradley Military Academy, where he will sometimes instruct unruly R.C. Collins to "kiss the gunner's daughter".  Harvey also hosts "Senior Chat" and "Law Talk" live in Phil's studio during which his Alzheimer's often takes ahold of him. Harvey has chronic problems with his throat, usually claiming to have some sort of "cheese wedge" lodged in his throat and requests a "plastic bottle of squirt" to help dislodge it.

He also has very poor eyesight, which causes him to struggle to read "copy" or news stories for his segments, often misreading the name of former New York City police chief Bernard Kerik as "Benaboo Keggie," New York City mayor Michael Bloomburg as "Miguel Blimbin" and Bill Cosby as "Buck Cornwall".  He also asserted on-air once that " 'seven per cant of Amae-ricans'  what, is that Puerto Ricans?  'drink darring the warkday' " (seven percent of Americans drink during the workday).

This character is based on Hendrie's late father.  Harvey was introduced on WIOD, Miami, as a member of O.J. Simpson's legal defense team.

Online fan community.
Phil Hendrie once had an active online fan community consisting of dozens of fan sites providing difficult-to-find audio from Phil's pre-syndication days.  But in late 2001, Premiere Radio Networks began a legal campaign to shut down all fan sites hosting audio of The Phil Hendrie Show even pre-syndication audio.  Audio is now available via "Backstage Pass" subscriptions to Hendrie's website.  Since late 2005, a growing community of Hendrie fans can be found at SweetFeatheryJesus.com (the site takes its name from a phrase frequently uttered by Pastor William Rennick). This site does not trade Phil Hendrie Show audio, but does enjoy a good relationship with the show itself.  Hendrie occasionally plugs the fansite on air, mentioning it as one of the few fansites he actually likes. There is also a Wiki for all things Phil; the link can be found below.

Raymond Lewis (September 3, 1952 in Los Angeles - February 11, 2001) was a basketball and streetball player.

Lewis is regarded as one of the best players never to have played in the NBA. When the Philadelphia 76ers attempted to sign him after drafting him in 1973, he was reported to have had a nasty contract dispute and was told to mature for another year. He never tried to enter a professional league again.

Lewis played in countless streetball and summer pro league matches and became a bona fide "street legend". Lewis is reported to have dropped 56 points in a 1983 summer pro league game against Michael Cooper, a winner of the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award . 

Lewis died of complications following an attempted amputation of an infected leg.

Prosthesis, an artificial appliance used to replace a lost natural structure; provided, however, that prosthesis shall include, but not be limited to, artificial arms, legs, breasts, scalp hair or glass eyes. The plural for prosthesis is prostheses.

Scalp hair prosthesis is an artificial substitute for scalp hair.
 
Hair prostheses are custom made and fitted to the shape and size of the person. They are handmade, colored and constructed. The ventilated hair is applied to the prosthetic hypoallergenic scalp skin. Men, women and children over the age of 5 can wear a cranial prosthesis. Many find these decives to be, well, rather uncomfortable. 

While there isn't a noticable difference between how a wig and cranial hair prostheses look on one who wears them, the needs of those wearing them are quite drastic. Doctors prescribe a prosthesis for patients who have lost their hair as a result of medical complications which they expect as the affects of "treatment" are inflicted upon their client/victims. Conditions such as alopecia areata, and alopecia totallis (both genetic disorder affecting the autoimmune system, exacerbated by ambient exposure to petrol chemicals such as Natural Gas and shampoo), trichotillomania (the pulling out of ones own hair), chemotherapy or any other clinical disease or treatment resulting in hair loss are pronounce/extreme examples of this. 
Cranial prostheses also help protect disease-weakened immune systems from energetic disturbances, some ultraviolet radiation, as well as protecting ones body temperature.

Many health plans provide coverage for hair prosthesis. Costs vary greatly but these pieces may be considered medical expenses, often tax deductible. Your state sales tax also may be fully refundable helping to defer cost.

New York City hairdresser Rodolfo Valentin had lead the way back in the 70 s, in the design of the very first scalp hair prosthesis available in the world.

<doc id="3005305" title="William D. Porter" nonfiltered="238" processed="236" dbindex="1500242">

William David Porter (10 March 1808   1 May 1864) was a flag officer of the United States Navy. He was the son of Commodore David Porter (1780 1843) and brother of Admiral David Dixon Porter (1813 1891).

 Early career .
Porter was born on 10 March 1808 in New Orleans, La.. He spent much of his childhood in Chester, Pa. After an early and unsuccessful attempt to stow away on his uncle's, John Porter's, ship-of-the-line Franklin, he signed on Franklin at the age of 12. Porter was appointed a midshipman on 1 January 1823 and 11 years later was commissioned a lieutenant. From 1838 to 1840, he served as lighthouse inspector for the portion of the east coast between Norfolk, Va. and New York. That duty was followed in 1840 with an assignment at the Washington Navy Yard as ordnance officer. During this assignment, he became interested in the development of an explosive shell suitable for naval use. After leaving Washington, Porter spent the next decade superintending the outfitting of new steam ships for the Navy, commanding supply vessels, and delivering mail and supplies to Navy units abroad.

Following retirement between 1855 and 1859, he was returned to active duty and took command of St. Mary's In that sloop-of-war, he patrolled the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Central America for two years protecting American interests in that area.

 Civil War .
The secession of Southern states in 1860 and 1861 caused St. Mary's to be recalled to her base at Mare Island, Calif. In the summer of 1861, Porter was relieved of command of the ship and ordered to Washington, D.C. In the autumn, he was assigned to special duty in St. Louis, Mo., to assist in establishing the Western Flotilla to seize and control the Mississippi and its tributaries for the Union. On 3 October, he was given the command of a ferryboat-turned-gunboat, New Era. Serving under Flag Officer Andrew Foote, he patrolled the Cumberland River, keeping a wary eye upon the growing Confederate defenses along the river. In November, he took his ship to St. Louis for repairs; and, upon his return to the flotilla at Cairo, Ill., New Era sported a new name, Essex, in honor of the frigate Essex, which Porter's father had commanded during the War of 1812.

Between January and August 1862, Porter served gallantly up and down the Mississippi River. On 10 January, Essex and St. Louis engaged three Confederate gunboats and forced them to retreat to the protection of Southern shore batteries. The two Union gunboats repeated the feat three days later and succeeded in damaging their opponents. Only Confederate shore batteries prevented the capture of the three steamers.

On 6 February, Essex joined the rest of Foote's gunboat squadron in the attack on Fort Henry. Porter's ship, second in line, sustained heavy fire from shore batteries and received at least 15 direct hits. About half an hour into the fray, Essex took a 32-pound shot through her bow shield. It pierced her boilers, releasing steam which severely scalded 28 men. Commander Porter himself blinded and scalded continued to conn his ship until she was clear of the action.

Though still severely hampered by his injuries, Porter directed the extensive repair and renovation of Essex from his sick bed. At the same time, he also superintended the construction of two other warships, the ironclads Lafayette and Choctaw.

Porter completed the renovation of Essex at St. Louis in July and rejoined the Western Flotilla at Vicksburg, Miss. later that month. At dawn on the 22d, Porter took Essex out to confront the Confederate ironclad ram CSS Arkansas which had recently left her refuge in the Yazoo River to seek greater safety under the cover of Vicksburg's shore batteries. In company with the smaller converted riverboat Queen of the West, Essex moved in toward the Southern warship. During the approach of the two Union ships, Confederate shore batteries subjected them to a withering fire. Finally, Essex struck Arkansas a jarring blow but at an oblique angle. As a result, she glanced off the Southern ram and ran aground parallel to her adversary. Porter worked furiously to free his ship and, after much difficulty, managed to retire, with Queen of the West close behind.

Thereafter, since Essex had sustained only minor damage, Porter kept her on station patrolling the lower Mississippi River between Vicksburg and Baton Rouge. On 5 August, his ship and Sumter assisted Union Army troops in repelling a Confederate land attack on Baton Rouge. The following morning, he headed north to Vicksburg to confront Arkansas once more. He found his quarry on a bend in the river, close to the shore. In the ensuing bombardment, Porter used an incendiary shell which he himself had invented. After about 20 minutes of shelling, Arkansas erupted into flames and soon blew up. Evidence suggests that the Confederate crew had set their own ship afire to prevent her capture. Be that as it may, Porter's bold action played no small part in the ram's destruction. Moreover, Congress recognized the role played by Porter and his ship in June 1864 when they belatedly awarded the Essex crew $25,000 in prize money.

Porter's last real action in the war occurred in September 1862 when Essex conducted a bombardment of Natchez, Miss., and duelled the shore batteries at Port Hudson, La. Later that month, he returned to New Orleans where new orders awaited him. Promoted to the rank of commodore, Porter was assigned to duty at New York. There, he served in various capacities until hospitalized in April 1864. On 1 May 1864, Commodore Porter died of heart disease at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. Although he was buried initially at Greenwood Cemetery in New York, he was moved to Philadelphia, Pa. in June and laid to rest beside his famous father, Commodore David Porter.

St. George Island is a part of Franklin County, Florida and is an island in the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is a barrier island, 28 miles long and two miles wide at its widest point which makes this a rare island. St. George Island is adjacent to Cape St. George Island. The island is separated from the mainland by a four-mile long bridge across Apalachicola Bay, connecting to Eastpoint, Florida. Nearby towns include Eastpoint, Carrabelle and Apalachicola.

Today, St. George Island is known for its serene and tranquil setting, where a number of beach homes and small hotels have sprouted up. They range from small cottages, to townhouses to large multi-million dollar beach homes. There are hundreds of dwellings there, mainly for tourists and there are few all-year residents that reside on the island. During the winter season, the island is almost empty. 

St. George Island State Park occupies the eastern nine miles of the island.  The park has a series of hiking trails, boardwalks and observation platforms. Bird watching is a popular activity there.

 History .
St. George Island was first inhabited by the Creek Indians between the 900s and 1400s. With the arrival of European colonists to the area in the late 1700s came an intense struggle for control. In 1803, the Creek Indians ceded a large tract of land, which included St. George Island, to trader John Forbes and Company, known as the Forbes Grant. 

During the early and mid-1900s the Island's pine forest was turpentined for the production of naval stores.

During World War II, St. George Island was a practice range for B-24 bombers from nearby Apalachicola.

In 1954, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the ship channel known as Bob Sikes Cut across St. George Island creating Cape St. George Island or "Little St. George Island" and enhanced its remoteness. The cut is used by the fishing fleet from Apalachicola and provides an access to the Gulf waters from the bayside.

 Geography .
The island is full of old relic sand dune ridges and sand dunes. Since this island is now inhabited and becoming developed quickly, the original appearance is long gone.

 Vegetation .
Scrub and sea oats can be found on the newer dunes, Slash pine flatwoods in the older relic dunes. The western part of the island is more forested while the eastern two-thirds is more sparse in trees.

Montenegro (Serbian:           or Crna Gora, pronounced , ), officially the Republic of Montenegro (                    or Republika Crna Gora), is a country located in southeastern Europe. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south, and borders Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast and Albania to the southeast. Its de-facto capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as Prijestonica  the old royal capital, or seat of the throne.

Independent from the late Middle Ages until 1918, the country was later a part of various incarnations of Yugoslavia and the state union of Serbia and Montenegro. Based on the results of a referendum held on May 21 2006, Montenegro declared independence on June 3 2006. On June 28, Montenegro became the 192nd member state of the United Nations.

 Name .
Montenegro's native name, Crna Gora, was first mentioned in a charter of St. Nicholas Monastery (Vranjina) issued by the Serbian King Milutin, in 1296 and translates literally to "black mountain," a reference to the dark forests that once covered the slopes of the Dinaric Alps as seen from the coast. The country's name in most Western European languages, including English, reflects an adoption of the Venetian-language term , also meaning "black mountain," which probably dates back to the era of Venetian hegemony over the area in the Middle Ages. Other languages, particularly nearby ones, use their own direct translation of the term, e.g. Albanian: , Bulgarian:           , Cherna gora; Romanian: , Greek:  and Turkish: ; "black mountain" from further afield include  and  (pinyin: "h ish n").

The ISO Alpha-2 code for Montenegro is ME and the Alpha-3 Code is MNE.

 History .
 
   
The Slav tribes, mixed with Illyrians, Avars and Romans, formed the semi-independent dukedom of Duklja by the tenth century. In 1077, Pope Gregory VII recognized Duklja as an independent state, acknowledging its King Mihailo (Michael) (of the Vojislavljevi  dynasty founded by nobleman Stefan Vojislav) as  (King of Duklja). The kingdom, however, paid tribute to the Byzantine Empire; later to the Bulgarian Empire; it gave birth to the later medieval kingdom of the Serbian Grand Prince () Stefan Nemanja, who originated from Duklja.  

The Principality of Zeta (which more closely corresponds to the early modern state of Montenegro) asserted itself towards 1360. The House of Bal¨i  (1360s 1421) and the House of Crnojevi  (1421 1499) ruled Zeta; and though the Ottoman Empire controlled the lands to the south and east from the 15th century, it never fully conquered Zeta.

In 1516, the secular prince ura  Crnojevi  abdicated in favour of the Archbishop Vavil, who then made Montenegro into a theocratic state under the rule of the prince-bishop (known as        , vladika) of Cetinje, a position held from 1697 by the Petrovi -Njego¨ family of the Ri ani clan. Petar Petrovi  Njego¨, perhaps the most influential vladika, reigned in the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, Danilo II Petrovi  Njego¨ became vladika, but in 1852 he married, left the priesthood, assumed the title of  (Prince), and transformed his land into a secular principality.


In 1910, Prince Nikola I became King of Montenegro. Two years later, in October, 1912, King Nikola declared war on the Ottoman Empire, precipitating the two Balkan Wars. The Montenegrin army attacked the Ottoman fortress city of Skutari, and forced the empire to gather a large army in neighbouring Macedonia. This Ottoman army was then attacked by the forces of Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria which entered the war by pre-arrangement. The result was a military disaster for the Ottomans, who were thrown back to an area north of Constantinople.

Montenegro emerged from the Balkan Wars doubled in size, receiving half of the former Ottoman territory known as the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, but without Skutari, the country's major prize in the war. The London Conference awarded Skutari to an independent Albania.

During World War I, Montenegro was part of the allies. In the course of the war, Montenegro was occupied by Austro-Hungarian troops. Feldmarschalleutnant Viktor Weber von Webenau became Military Governor of Montenegro on February 26 1916.
In 1918, the Podgorica Assembly voted for uniting Montenegro with the Kingdom of Serbia. However, pro-independence Montenegrins revolted on Christmas Day 1919 against Serbia. The revolt was finally suppressed in 1924. 

From 1945 to 1992, Montenegro separated from Serbia and became a constituent republic in its own right of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was during this time that the present capital Podgorica was renamed Titograd, after Josip Broz Tito, dictator of Yugoslavia. Over the next half century, Montenegro remained one of six constituent republics of Yugoslavia.

Union with Serbia (1992 2006).
After the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, Montenegro agreed on a federation with Serbia, first as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then as a looser State Union of Serbia and Montenegro that broke up as soon as a deadline for holding an independence referendum expired.


In the referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992, 95.96% of the votes were cast for remaining in the federation with Serbia, although the turnout was at 66% because of a boycott by the Muslim, Albanian and Catholic minorities as well as of pro-independence Montenegrins. The opposition claimed that poll was organized under undemocratic conditions, during war time in the former Yugoslavia, with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote. There is no impartial report on the fairness of the referendum, as the 1992 referendum was totally unmonitored, unlike the 2006 vote, which was monitored by the European Union. 

In 1996, Milo  ukanovi 's government de facto severed ties between Montenegro and Serbia, which was then still under Milo¨evi . Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the Deutsche Mark as its currency. It has since adopted the euro, though it is not formally part of the Eurozone. Subsequent governments of Montenegro carried out pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade. Despite its pro-independence leanings, targets in Montenegro were repeatedly bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999.

In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement regarding continued cooperation. In 2003, the Yugoslav federation was replaced in favour of a looser state union named Serbia and Montenegro and a possible referendum on Montenegrin independence was postponed for a minimum of three years.

 Independence .
The status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a referendum on Montenegrin independence on May 21, 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate. 230,661 votes or 55.5% were for independence and 185,002 votes or 44.5% were against. The 45,659 difference narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under rules set by the European Union.  According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have all recognized Montenegro's independence; doing so removed all remaining obstacles from Montenegro's path towards becoming the world's newest sovereign state.


The 2006 referendum was monitored by 5 international observer missions, headed by an OSCE/ODIHR monitoring team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from CEMI and other organizations). The OSCE/ODIHR ROM joined efforts with the observers of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE) and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM in its preliminary report "assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation." Furthermore, the report assessed that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that "there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights." 

On June 3 2006, the Parliament of Montenegro declared the independence of Montenegro, formally confirming the result of the referendum on independence. Serbia did not obstruct the ruling, confirming its own independence and declaring the Union of Serbia and Montenegro dead shortly thereafter.

International recognition of Montenegro.

The first state to recognise Montenegro was Iceland, on June 8, 2006, followed by Switzerland and Estonia on June 9, and Russia on June 11. Recognition by Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia soon followed. The European Union and the United States recognized Montenegro on June 12, as have various member states of the EU and other European countries. The United Kingdom formally extended recognition on June 13, as did the People's Republic of China and France on June 14, meaning that all five permanent United Nations Security Council members recognise the government of Montenegro.  Serbia, the other former component of the State Union, recognised Montenegro on June 15. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe decided to accept Montenegro as the 56th member of the organization on June 21 and the country took its seat at the Permanent Council on June 22. The United Nations, in a vote of the Security Council, decided to offer full membership of the organisation to Montenegro on June 22, 2006. Montenegro was confirmed as a member on June 28.  In January 2007, Montenegro received full membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group, and also set out to establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican.

 Geography .




Montenegro borders Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. 

Some of the cities and towns in Montenegro are:
 Podgorica (capital;  152,025 inhabitants)	;
 Nik¨i  (74,706)	;
 Pljevlja (39,593)	;
 Bijelo Polje (55,628)	;
 Herceg Novi (27,593, including Igalo) 	;
 Berane (38,953)	;
 The former royal capital and the seat of the throne is Cetinje (20,307).


The Montenegrin surface ranges from high peaks along its borders with Kosovo and Albania, a segment of the Karst of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only one to four miles wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where Mount Lov en and Mount Orjen plunge abruptly into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor.

Montenegro's large Karst region lies generally at elevations of 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) above sea level; some parts, however, rise to 2,000 metres (6,560 ft), such as Mount Orjen (1,894 m / 6,214 ft), the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The Zeta River valley, at an elevation of 500 metres (1,640 ft), is the lowest segment.

The rough mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe. They average more than 2,000 metres (6,560 ft) in elevation. One of the country's notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountains, which reaches a height of 2,522 metres (8,274 ft). The Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.

 Longest beach: Velipoja Beach, Ulcinj   13,000 m (8 miles) 	;
 Highest peak: Bobotov Kuk (Durmitor)   2,522 m (8,274 ft);
 Largest lake: Lake Scutari   391 km² (151 sq mi) of surface area;
 Deepest canyon: Tara River Canyon   1,300 m (4,265 ft);
 Biggest bay: Bay of Kotor;
 National parks: Durmitor   390 km² (150 sq mi), Lov en   64 km² (25 sq mi), Biogradska Gora   54 km² (21 sq mi), Lake Scutari   400 km² (154 sq mi);
 UNESCO World Heritage sites: Durmitor and Tara River Canyon, old city of Kotor.

 Government and politics .

By its current constitution, Montenegro is defined as a "democratic, welfare, and ecological state".

 Government;
The current Government of the Republic of Montenegro (Vlada Republike Crne Gore) comprises the prime minister, the deputy prime ministers as well as ministers. ´eljko ¦turanovi  is the Prime Minister of Montenegro and head of the Government. The ruling party in Montenegro is the center-left Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) (Demokratska Partija Socijalista Crna Gore), in coalition with much smaller Social Democratic Party of Montenegro (SDP) (Socijaldemokratska Partija Crne Gore).

President.

The President of Montenegro is elected for a period of five years through direct and secret ballots. According to the constitution, the President will represent the republic in the country and abroad, promulgate laws by ordinance, call elections for the Assembly, propose to the Assembly candidates for the Prime Minister, president and justices of the Constitutional Court, propose to the Assembly calling of a referendum, grant amnesty for criminal offences prescribed by the republican law, confer decoration and awards, and perform all other duties in accordance with the Constitution. The President shall also be a member of the Supreme Defence Council.

Parliament.
The Montenegrin Parliament (Skup¨tina Republike Crne Gore) passes all laws in Montenegro, ratifies international treaties, appoints the Prime Minister, ministers, and justices of all courts, adopts the budget and performs other duties as established by the Constitution. The Parliament can pass a vote of no-confidence on the Government by a majority of the members. One deputy is elected per 6,000 voters, which in turn results in a reduction of total number of deputies in the Assembly of Montenegro (the present assembly convening comprises 78 deputies instead of previous number of 71). The current president of the Parliament is Ranko Krivokapi .

The present Assembly convening 81 seats instead of previous number of 75
(parliamentary elections were on 10 September 2006 and were the first after the proclamation of independence. The constituent Assembly was on 2 October 2006).

Symbols.
A new official flag of Montenegro was adopted on July 12 2004 by the Montenegrin legislature. The new flag is based on the personal standard of King Nikola I of Montenegro. This flag was all red with a gold border, a gold coat of arms, and the initials    in Cyrillic script (corresponding to NI in Latin script) representing King Nikola I. These initials are omitted from the modern flag.

The national day of 13 July marks the date in 1878 when the Congress of Berlin recognised Montenegro as the 27th independent state in the world and the start of one of the first popular uprisings in Europe against the Axis Powers on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.

In 2004, the Montenegrin legislature selected a popular Montenegrin folk song, Oh, the Bright Dawn of May, as the national anthem. Montenegro's official anthem during the reign of King Nikola was  (To our beautiful Montenegro). The music was composed by the King's son Knjaz Mirko. The Montenegrin popular anthem has been Onamo, 'namo! since King Nikola I wrote it in the 1860s.

 Administrative divisions .


Montenegro is divided into twenty-one municipalities (op¨tina), and two urban municipalities, subdivisions of Podgorica municipality:



Andrijevica;
Bar;
Berane;
Bijelo Polje;
Budva;
Cetinje;
Danilovgrad;
Herceg Novi;
Kola¨in;
Kotor;
Mojkovac;
Nik¨i ;

Plav;
Plu¸ine;
Pljevlja;
Podgorica;
Golubovci;
Tuzi;
Ro¸aje;
¦avnik;
Tivat;
Ulcinj;
´abljak;



 Economy .

During the era of communism Montenegro experienced a rapid period of urbanization and industrialization. An industrial sector based on electricity generation, steel, aluminum, coal mining, forestry and wood processing, textiles and tobacco manufacture was built up, with trade, overseas shipping, and particularly tourism, increasingly important by the late 1980s.   

The loss of previously guaranteed markets and suppliers after the break up of Yugoslavia left the Montenegrin industrial sector reeling as production was suspended and the privatization program, begun in 1989, was interrupted. The disintegration of the Yugoslav market, and the imposition of the UN sanctions in May 1992 were the causes of the greatest economic and financial crisis since World War II. During 1993, two thirds of the Montenegrin population lived below the poverty line, while frequent interruptions in relief supplies caused the health and environmental protection to drop below the minimum of international standards. The financial losses under the adverse effects of the UN sanctions on the overall economy of Montenegro are estimated to be approximately $6.39 billion. This period also experienced the second highest hyperinflation in  history (3 million percent in January 1994) (The highest hyperinflation happened in Hungary after the end of World War II, when inflation there hit 4.19 x 10^16 percent).

In 1997, Milo  ukanovi  took control over the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS) and began severing ties with Milosevic' Serbia. He blamed the policies of Slobodan Milo¨evi  for the overall decline of the Montenegrin economy, as well as Milo¨evi 's systematic persecution of non-serbs. Montenegro introduced the German mark as response to again-growing inflation, and insisted on taking more control over its economic fate. This eventually resulted in creation of Serbia and Montenegro, a loose union in which Montenegro mostly took responsibility for its economic policies.

This was followed by implementation of faster and more efficient privatization, passing of reform laws, introduction of VAT and usage of euro as Montenegro's legal tender. The government brought up "The Agenda"

 Demographics .



According to 2003 census, Montenegro has 620,145 citizens. If the methodology used up to 1991 was used in the 2003 census, Montenegro would officially have 673,094 citizens. Current estimates are somewhere around 630,000 citizens.

Ethnic composition according to the 2003 census :  
 Montenegrins: 267,669 (43.16%);
 Serbs: 198,414 (31.99%);
 Bosniaks: 48,184 (7.77%);
 Albanians:  31,163 (5.03%);
 Muslims by nationality: 24,625 (3.97%);
 Croats: 6,811 (1.1%);
 Roma, Egyptians & Ashkalis: 2,826 (0.46%) ;

Over 270,000 citizens of Serbia have Montenegrin citizenship. Around 69,000 of them are Montenegrins, while others are mostly Serbs. It should be noted that those terms have a slightly different meaning in Serbia. People who may declare themselves Serbs if living in Montenegro, to emphasise their connection with the Serbian cultural space, may declare themselves Montenegrins in Serbia, as the identity needing to be emphasised would be the Montenegrin one. Many north-east Montenegrins consider all Montenegrins Serbs and south-west Montenegrins view themselves a separate nation. This division was evident during Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006.

In the constitution of Montenegro adopted in 1992, the official language of the republic was changed from Serbo-Croat to the Ijekavian standard dialect of Serbian. As of 2003, 63.5% of the population declare Serbian their mother tongue, while almost 22% declare Montenegrin. The dialects used are the same, very similar to those used by Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, with slight nuances.

Over 74% of Montenegrin citizens are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of them adherents of the Serbian Orthodox Church, although there is also the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which is not officially recognized. 110,000 Muslims make up 17.74% of Montenegro's population. They are divided into three main groups: ethnic Albanians, and Slavic Muslims split among Bosniaks, who speak Bosnian and Montenegrin Muslims, who prefer Serbian. Albanians are a separate group, speaking their own language, Albanian (5.26%) and living mostly in the south-east, especially in Ulcinj, where they form the majority of the population. Bosniaks are Slavic Muslims speaking the Bosnian language and living mostly in the north. Finally, there are a small groups of autochthonous Croats and other Roman Catholic inhabitants, who live mostly in the coastal areas, particularly the Bay of Kotor. New estimates of Croats in 2006 put the figure at 7,100.

 Culture .


Because of the country's location, the culture of Montenegro has been shaped by a variety of influences throughout history. The influence of Orthodox South Slavic, Central European, and seafaring Adriatic cultures (notably parts of Italy) have been the most imporant in recent centuries. 

Montenegro has many significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is especially well known for its religious monuments, including the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon, the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rock (¦krpjela), the Savina Monastery and others. Montenegro's medieval monasteries contain thousands of square metres of frescos on their walls.  

The traditional folk dance of the Montenegrins is the Oro, a circle dance that involves dancers standing on each other's shoulders in a circle while one or two dancers are dancing in the middle.

The first literary works written in the region are ten centuries old, and the first Montenegrin book was printed five hundred years ago. The first state-owned printing press was located in Cetinje in 1494, where the first South Slavic book was printed the same year (Oktoih). Ancient manuscripts, dating from the thirteenth century, are kept in the Montenegrin monasteries.  

Montenegro's capital Podgorica and the former royal capital of Cetinje are the two most important centers of culture and the arts in the country.

 Education .

Education in Montenegro is regulated by the Montenegrin Ministry of Education and Science.

Education starts in either pre-schools or elementary schools. Children enroll in elementary schools (Serbian: Osnovna ¨kola) at the age of 7; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education, which lasts 3 or (in the great majority of cases) 4 years and ends with graduation(Matura). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years.

 Miscellaneous .
Serbia and Montenegro were represented by a single football team in the 2006 FIFA World Cup tournament, despite having formally split just days prior to its start. Following this event, this team is to be inherited by Serbia, while a new one is to be organized to represent Montenegro in future international competitions.

The first official international representation of Montenegro as an independent state was in the Miss World 2006 celebrated on September 30, 2006 in Warsaw, Poland. Ivana Kne¸evi  from the city of Bar was the very first Miss Montenegro at any international beauty pageant. Both Montenegro and Serbia competed separately in this pageant for the first time after the state union came to an end on June 3, 2006.

The 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale is set in Montenegro, although the filming was done in Italy and the Czech Republic.

<doc id="4933406" title="Shane Salerno" nonfiltered="247" processed="245" dbindex="1500251">


Shane Salerno (b. 1972) is a Hollywood screenwriter.  His screenplays include  Armageddon, Breakdown, Alien vs. Predator, and Shaft.

Fade In Magazine selected Salerno as one of the "100 people you need to know in Hollywood" in the 2001 issue. Detour Magazine voted him one of "Hollywood's true shapers of pop culture" in their annual "hot thirty under thirty" edition.

Directors who have chosen Salerno to write or rewrite their films include Oscar winners Steven Spielberg (Thunder Below), Ron Howard (Bay of Pigs) William Friedkin (Night Train) Oscar nominees Michael Mann (The Border) and John Singleton (Shaft) and blockbuster directors Michael Bay (Armageddon), Wolfgang Petersen (L.A. Fed), Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown), and most recently Jan De Bont (MEG). 

Salerno has written or re-written star vehicles for Oscar winners Michael Douglas and Nicolas Cage as well as Bruce Willis, George Clooney, Ben Affleck, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Christian Bale, Jeffrey Wright, Liv Tyler, Ving Rhames, Eva Mendes, Wes Bentley, Billy Bob Thornton, Vera Farmiga, Treat Williams and Kurt Russell among many others.

Shane Salerno was born in Memphis, Tennessee. While a senior in high school, Salerno wrote, produced and directed the award winning documentary short film "Sundown: The Future of Children and Drugs". The film debuted on Larry King Live in September 1991. Larry King ended the interview by saying "And Shane Salerno, one has a feeling we are going to be hearing about you. I have this feeling." "Sundown" won several "best documentary of the year" honors and was showcased on every major talk show. Additionally Salerno was honored, in separate ceremonies, in both houses of Congress.

The critical acclaim "Sundown" received led nine-time Emmy Award winner Gregory Hoblit to invite a then nineteen year old Salerno to apprentice on the first season of NYPD Blue as a writer-director. Salerno credits the backstage pass to the series during a year when they were honored with a record 26 Emmy nominations and David Caruso's storied exit as a truly unique front line film school.

By age 22, Salerno was consistently writing the highest rated episodes of the FOX TV series New York Undercover. At the end of the first season, Salerno asked to be let out of his contract in order to pursue feature opportunities that he was being offered.

In a three month period he sold A Season in Hell in a high profile, page one spec sale, script doctored the screenplay to the Paramount film Breakdown and adapted the World War II submarine thriller Thunder Below for Steven Spielberg and the newly formed Dreamworks Pictures.

At just 24, director Michael Bay recruited Salerno to rewrite Armageddon based on an original screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh. In Visions of Armageddon, the book on the making of the film, Michael Bay calls Salerno's work on the script "brilliant". The blockbuster film debuted at #1 on July 1, 1998 and was the highest grossing film of the year, earning over $570 million worldwide.

In 1998, at the age of 25, Variety selected Salerno as one of the "hottest new creatives on the film scene." Based on Thunder Below and Armageddon, John Singleton (the youngest director ever nominated for an Oscar) asked Salerno to serve as his writing partner on Shaft which Paramount Pictures was mounting. The Singleton-Salerno collaboration (aided by novelist Richard Price) resulted in Salerno's second #1 film when "Shaft" debuted at the top of the box office on June 16, 2000.

That year, Salerno returned to television at age 27 by co-creating (with novelist Don Winslow), executive producing and serving as showrunner, head writer, and music supervisor for the NBC television series  starring Vera Farmiga, Oded Fehr, and Golden Globe winner Ving Rhames. The short-lived series won and was nominated for awards in acting, cinematography and sound.

Salerno lured former career criminal turned bestselling novelist and actor Ed Bunker (Reservoir Dogs  Mr. Blue) as a technical advisor, Peabody-winning journalist Jerry Nachman and acclaimed playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis (Jesus Hopped the A Train) as members  of his writing staff.

Possessing a rabid devotion to film music, Salerno served as music supervisor on UC: Undercover where he recruited Grammy-winning film composer David Arnold, known for his brilliant scores for Independence Day and the James Bond films, to score the series' main title theme. Seeking a new sound for the weekly score, Salerno convinced the Dust Brothers (known for their work in David Fincher's Fight Club) to compose for their first television series. The series was up against ABC's multi Emmy-winning powerhouse The Practice, however, and it was cancelled in 2002.

At 30, Salerno rewrote Alien vs. Predator heavily throughout pre-production and production in Prague although (over the strong protest of 20th Century Fox and the producers) Salerno did not receive screen credit. The film debuted at #1 on August 13, 2004 with a $38.3 opening weekend and went on to become Fox's most profitable film of 2004. A sequel is being readied.

In 2004 Salerno became the youngest "Guest of Honor" speaker in the history of the Los Angeles Screenwriting Expo, attended by over 5,000 people. The response was so strong to his 2004 appearance that he was asked back in 2005. His second appearance was a sold out, standing room only affair. Other guests of honor that year included such distinguished names as two-time Oscar winner William Goldman, Aaron Sorkin, David Koepp, and David Milch.

In January 2006, Shane Salerno formed The Story Factory to develop and produce television series and films. His work continues to make him a much sought-after writer whose unique writing draws in actors, directors, and studios that are eager to work with him.

<doc id="4893864" title="Timothy W. Potter" nonfiltered="248" processed="246" dbindex="1500252">
Timothy William Potter (born 1944; died January 2000) was a prominent archaeologist of ancient Italy, as well as of Roman Britain, best known for his focus on landscape archaeology.

Potter studied at Cambridge, receiving his B.A. from Trinity College (1966) and his Ph.D. in 1974; his Ph.D. thesis was entitled Archaeological Topography of Central and Southern Ager Faliscus.  In the 1980s Potter excavated at Stonea, a Roman settlement in the fens of Cambridgeshire.

Potter was a student of John Bryan Ward-Perkins and a member of the South Etruria Survey conducted by the British School at Rome.  As part of the survey Potter worked on the Ager Faliscus leading to two influential books, A Faliscan Town in South Etruria: Excavations at Narce 1966-71 (1976) and The changing landscape of South Etruria (1979).  Potter also authored a popular course textbook entitled Roman Italy (1987). The survey also led to his important excavations at Monte Gelato (1986-1990) and Narce (1966-1971).

Potter taught at the University of Lancaster (1973-1978) where he instituted a new archaeology program.  In 1978 he moved to the British Museum and their department of Prehistoric and Romano-British Antiquities, serving as assistant keeper from 1978 to 1995 and keeper from 1995 until his death.

<doc id="4345159" title="History of Ayyavazhi" nonfiltered="251" processed="249" dbindex="1500256">


The History of Ayyavazhi traces the religious history of Ayyavazhi a religion originated in mid-ninteenth century in Southern India.  Ayyavazhi came to be noticed by large number of people gathering to worship Ayya Vaikundar in the middle of the 19th century. The majority of the follwers of Ayyavazhi were from marginalised and poor sections of society.  

Right from the beginning of the development Ayyavazhi was seen in competition by the  Christian missionaries on their mission. This is evident by the reports of Ayyavazhi found in the reports of the Christian missionaries  . Although the majority of the followers of Ayyavazhi were from the Chanar caste (a social group), people of other castes also crowded around Vaikundar  . It was not usual at the time for people of different castes to intermingle. 

 Early Years .
By the middle of Nineteenth century, Ayyavazhi had come to be a recognisable religion, in South Travancore and South Tirunelveli  . The growth of the religion increased significantly from the forties through the decades. After the death of the founder, the religion was also spread by his teachings and the religious books Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool.

Citars.

When Ayya was alive he instructed the five Citars with the rules and regulations.  They were asked to preach them to the people. After he died, the disciples went to different parts of the country, preaching them to the people.

Payyans.


According to some oral traditions Muthukutty called the son of Thirumalammal affetionately as Payyan (little boy). No one but Payyan was allowed to perform the panivedai to Ayya when ever the Citar were away. He was allowed to offer the Nithiya Pal to Ayya during the Tavam. And after Muthukutti died, Payyan started administrating the Swamithoppe Pathi, in spite of the disputes with Vellaicchamiyar who claimed for the administration in the court, but the judjement was in favour of Payyan. Other Pathis came under the administration of the native followers of Ayya of that places.  After the time of Payyan the descendants of him started the administration. The eldest of them was called Pattathu Ayya.

Pattathu Ayyas so far were, 

Pattathu Ayya. Podukkutty;
Pattathu Ayya. Krishna Narayana Vadivu;
Pattathu Ayya. Chella vadivu;
Pattathu Ayya. Bala Krishnan;
Pattathu Ayya. Chella Raj;
Pattathu Ayya. Bala Prajapathi Adikalar;

Though the eldest of the Payyans now is Anantha kutty Nadar, due to unknown reasons he refused to accept the rank. So the next elder most, Bala Prajapathi Adikalar is considered as the present Pattathu Ayya.

Nizhal Thangals.
The Nizhal Thangals are the worship centers of Ayyavazhi built by devoult followers of Ayya. Some of them are believed to be built when Ayya was alive. Many of the Nizhal Thangals were not under the rules of Ayyavazhi scriptures. Hundreds of Thangals arose in different parts of the country. Some were run by single individuals and some other by Ayyavazhi organisations and independent trusts.  But all were bonded under Swamithoppe only religiously by not officially. This rate of rise of Thangals even increased after the seventies of the twentieth century.

After Indian Independence.

The growth of Ayyavazhi after the independence of India is significant especially in the northern districts of Tamil Nadu . Nizhal Thangals rose in hundreds throughout the state.  Around forties the Lotus with Namam was announced as the Symbol of Ayyavazhi.

Fast Spread.
Then from the late 1970s Ayyavazhi recorded rapid growth. Bala Prajapathi Adikalar, the present Pattathu Ayya of Swamithoppe Pathi had a significant role in the later day developments of Ayyavazhi. He is also famous throughout Tamil Nadu. From 1975 the Masi Procession (The Vaikunda Avatara Orvalam) was held and today it was one among the largest religious procession of the district. People from almost all the districts of Tamil Nadu and from some parts of Kerala, Andra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharastra participate in this procession. A few years later the Thiruvanathapuram procession and the Thiruchendur Procession were also held. From 1994 onwards The Vaikunda Avataram was declared as a holiday for the district of Kanyakumari. From this year (2006) Ayya Vaikunda Avataram was declared as a Holiday for the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin. 

Ayyavazhi conferences.
Many conferences have been organized across the country. The first conference was held at Marthandam for three days on a date that is unknown.  Later, conducted at Valliyoor, Chennai, Arumuganeri, Nagercoil, Thiruvanathapuram and almost at all the taluk head quarters of Kanyakumari District.  The Payyans as well as experts deliver lectures on the tenets of Ayyavazhi at the conferences. Thiru Edu-Vasippu is also conducted.

<doc id="489764" title="1-800-Missing" nonfiltered="253" processed="251" dbindex="1500258">
1-800-Missing (second season title:  Missing) is a Canadian television series, shown and set in the US.  It is centred on Jess Mastriani, played by Caterina Scorsone, a woman in her 20s who receives psychic abilities after being hit by lightning.  She is employed by a special FBI Task Force because she has visions which, once interpreted, contain clues that will help her find missing people.

The series initially starred Gloria Reuben as Brooke Haslett, the skeptical partner of Jess.  

In the second season, significant changes, including casting, were made.  The partner of Jess was changed to Nicole Scott, played by Vivica A. Fox.  The psychic powers of Jess remain important, but there is more attention played to the other characters.

This is based on the 1-800-WHERE-R-YOU series by Meg Cabot.

Cast.
Gloria Reuben - FBI Agent Brooke Haslett (2003-2004) ;
Caterina Scorsone - FBI Agent Jess Mastriani (2003-);
Justina Machado - FBI Agent Sunny Estrada (2003-2004) ;
Vivica A. Fox -  FBI Agent Nicole Scott (2004-) ;
Mark Consuelos - FBI Agent Antonio Cortez (2004-2006) ;
Dean McDermott - Assistant Director Alan Coyle (2003-2004);
Justin Louis - Assistant Director John Pollock (2004-);

Characters.
Jess Mastriani.
Special Agent Jessica Mastriani wanted to take over her parents restaurant in Indiana. But when she was gifted with visions (after she was hit by a lightning) which helped her finding missing people, the FBI took her as a "consultant". Jess spent helping the FBI a year and when it was over, she decided to join the FBI and to be trained as an agent.

She was later romanticly involved with Collin, an agent of the NSA who would help her in some cases.

Nicole Scott.
Special Agent Nicole Scott could be one of the FBI's top agents, except for one catch - she has a problem with authority. She was raised in a series of foster homes. She never knew who her parents were, and in the 3rd season, she finds her mother and they become a family. She buys a house and wants to live there alone or with her "near-future family" (how she called it).

Later in the series (season 2) she falls in love with Antonio, but they later (season 3, episode 6) decide that this love would fall into pieces since they are on the same team and when one of them must do another job. When Antonio died at the end of an episode (his car explodes with him inside), Nicole is horrified and begins to breakdown in tears. In the last moment before the explosion, they wanted to take it another time with each other.

Antonio Cortez.
Special Agent Antonio Carlos Cortez is revealed as a forensic at the first episode of the second season. He's often in the background when Jess and Nicole get the respect of the people. Antonio didn't liked Jess at the beginning of the second season. He was a forensic and didn't thaught what the visions would help them. After some successfully closed cases, he said that he's sorry and they become friends. He fell at the middle of the third season in love with Nicole which is forbidden. 

Antonio died when his car exploded after Nicole and he decided to be together again and that they would "meet for breakfast". With his death the season and the whole series possibly ended.

John Pollock.
  
Assistant Director John Pollock is one of the most powerful men in the Bureau. He considers that a pretty good start. A shrewd, ruthless political player, Pollock can turn any situation to his advantage. He brought Jess to Washington D.C. because her solve rate in Indiana was nothing short of spectacular. But her gifts make him uneasy because they can't be quantified or controlled. He appreciates Nicole's stellar solve rate, but he's cautious of her independence and nonstandard methods.

<doc id="3293969" title="Glass Mask" nonfiltered="254" processed="252" dbindex="1500259">







Glass Mask (       Garasu no Kamen) is a long running sh jo manga by Suzue Miuchi, serialised in Hana to Yume from January 1976, and collected in 42 tank bon as of 2006. The title refers poetically to the mask of faces that actors wear - while expressing emotions that are not their own, the mask they wear (their acting) is as fragile as glass. If the actors are distracted, their mask will "break" and show on stage the actors' true feelings.

 Story .
Glass Mask is a saga depicting the devotion of Maya Kitajima (     Kitajima Maya) to the performing arts as a professional stage actress, and her competition with her skilled rival, Ayumi Himekawa (     Himekawa Ayumi). They are both pursuing the degree of acting proficiency and career success required to play the lead role of the legendary stage play "The Crimson Goddess". Maya has dreamed of becoming an actress all her life, but no one in her family believes she can do it, and she is determined to prove them wrong. As the story unfolds it encompasses the tangled human relationships of many characters, including Maya's mentor, Chigusa Tsukikage (     Tsukikage Chigusa), who discovered Maya's tremendous talent for acting during her search for a successor capable of performing the role of the Crimson Goddess, and Masumi Hayami (     Hayami Masumi), the young president of a large production company, who often interacts with Maya as a crafty and cold-hearted entrepreneur, while giving her faithful support and warm encouragement in the disguise of an anonymous fan ('The Purple Rose Person', or "murasaki no bara no hito" as Maya calls him for his trademark gift of purple roses). Though there is an age difference of eleven years, Masumi falls in love with Maya and gives her encouragement in subtle ways.  

While many chapters have been published in 'Hana to Yume' subsequent to the collected manga volumes, Miuchi is, for reasons of her own, redrawing chapters and initiating changes to the storyline.  The most recently published volume features a cell phone, something which did not exist at the beginning of the series' run and may be evidence of a desire by the manga artist to modernize certain aspects of the series.  Certain elements of the prior storyline in the 'Hana to Yume' chapters have also led to fan speculation that Miuchi may have decided to change the storyline entirely by disregarding these chapters and rewriting them to suit the new direction she wishes to take the series in.

Certain stylistic elements of Glass Mask are quite similar to those of sports manga and anime such as Attack No. 1 and Ace o Nerae!, such as the heroine's complete and total devotion to her craft, a struggle to persevere in the face of crippling self-doubts and lack of support from family and peers, and training programs that are often quite grueling and brutal. During one rehearsal, Tsukikage is unhappy with Maya for not reaching the emotional peak needed to perform the scene and slaps her repeatedly until she gets it right. The rivalry between Maya and Ayumi mirrors that between Hiromi and Reika in Ace o Nerae, or Kozue and Yoshimura in Attack No. 1. 

A live action version adapted the first 38 volumes of the series in 1997, and continued in 1998 as "Garasu no Kamen 2." Both productions starred Yumi Adachi as Maya Kitajima.

 Anime .
There have been three anime adaptations, first a 23 episode TV series produced by Eiken in 1984, then a three episode OVA remake of the first few chapters in 1998 by TMS Entertainment. Then in 2005 TMS began a new TV series, starting from the beginning of the story.

The Eiken anime series was a success in Italy (Il grande sogno di Maya) and in France (Laura ou la passion du théâtre). Gisaburo Sugii was the series' supervising director. The 1984 series, which features a theme song performed by Mariko Ashibe, features opening animation of Maya dancing, seemingly inspired by Flashdance. 

 Character Name Changes .

Although the Italian version of the 1984 Glass Mask anime did not change any of the character names from the original Japanese, many of the names were changed in the French dub. In the French version, Maya Kitajima is Laura Nessonier; Chigusa Tsukikage is Madame Chloe de St-Fiacre; Ayumi Himekawa is Sidonie Lecuyer; and Hayami is Maxime Darcy.

Roy A. Rappaport (1926 1997) was a distinguished anthropologist known for his contributions to the anthropological study of ritual and to ecological anthropology.  Rappaport received his Ph.D. at Columbia University and then held a position at the University of Michigan.  One of his publications, Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People (1968), is an ecological account of ritual among the Tsembaga of New Guinea.  This book is often considered the most influential and most cited work in ecological anthropology.  In that book, and elaborated elsewhere, Rappaport coined the distinction between a people's cognized environment and their operational environment, that is between how a people interpret their ecological niche and how their reality actually exists.

Rappaport served as Chair of the Department of Anthropology, University of Michigan, and as a past president of the American Anthropological Association.

Bao Zheng () (999 1062) was a much-praised judge from Song China. His job title was the Mayor of the capital city Kaifeng (    ) at the time.  Because of his renowned fairness, he was popularly glorfied "Blue-Sky Bao" () or "Lord Bao" (). He was also nicknamed "Darkie Bao" () by his enemies due to his very dark complexion. (This is more of a myth and glorification.) His courtesy name was Xiren (  ).

He was born into a scholar family in Hefei, Anhui province, where the Memorial Temple of Lord Bao (   ) is still located near the city centre. It was built in 1066 close to his tomb. At the age of 29, he passed the highest-level imperial exams and became qualified as a Jinshi. He was a magistrate in Bian (Kaifeng), the capital of the Song dynasty.

He is famous for his uncompromising stance against corruption among the government officials at the time. He upheld justice and refused to yield to higher powers including the "royal father-in-law" (  ) who was also appointed as the Grand Tutor (  ) and was known as Grand Tutor Pang () he treated Bao as an enemy. 

He had conflicts with other powerful members of the imperial court as well, including the Prime Minister, Song Yang. He had 30 high officials demoted or dismissed for corruption, bribery, or dereliction of duty. He also had Zhang Yaozhuo, uncle of the high-ranked imperial concubine impeached 6 times.  In addition, as the imperial censor, he avoided punishment despite having many other contemporary imperial censors punished for minor statements.


Bao Zheng also managed to remain in favor by cultivating a long standing friendship with one of Emperor Renzong's uncles, the Eighth Imperial Prince ().

His burial site in Hefei contains his tomb along with the tombs of family members and a memorial temple.

In opera or drama, he is often portrayed with a black face and a white crescent shaped birthmark on his forehead. In most dramatization of his stories, he used a set of guillotines, given to him by the emperor, to execute criminals. The one decorated with a dog's head was used on commoners. The one decorated with a tiger's head was used on government officials. The one decorated with a dragon's head was used on royalties. He was granted a golden rod by the previous emperor which he was authorized to chastise the current emperor with. He was also granted a precious sword from the previous emperor as a license to execute any royalties before reporting to the emperor to get approval first (from where arose the idiom "    ", kill first, report later). In these works he was often helped by 12 deputies and detectives, collectively known as      (seven Xia and five Yi).

His name became synonymous with justice, with the clear blue sky (qing tian;   ) became a popular metaphor to justice in the Chinese-speaking world.  Due to his strong sense of justice, he is very popular in China, especially among the peasants and the poor.  He became the subject of literature and modern Chinese TV series in which his adventures and cases are featured.

There are many legends and stories about Bao and his witty approach to solve mysterious and tough cases.  Some famous examples include:

       The story about Bao executing Chen Shimei (   ), who abandoned his previous wife (and later tried to have her killed) in order to marry royalty.
 
         The story of a plot to discredit a concubine by swapping her son (the new born crown prince) with a civet, in which Bao disguised as Yan Luo to try Guo Huai (  ). Guo supported Bao in front of the Emperor early in his career, making the case personally difficult for the judge. The perpetrator confessed when he thought he was in hell.


 Bao Zheng in Chinese Popular Culture .

The TV series "Justice Bao" [[   ]] was filmed in Taiwan. The series became popular in Hong Kong during the night time slot. It was also one of the first dramas that used the NICEM technology (Dual Sound Switch Cantonese/Mandarin). The series was so successful that it ran for nearly 5 years in the mid 90's and created spin-off series, as well as other merchandise products related to Bao Zheng. Most of the series were pure fiction relating to Bao Zheng, especially with some Chinese fantasy thrown in. The series taught Chinese traditional values, like respecting elders.

Stephen Chow made a spin-off movie based on Bao Zheng called Hail the Judge or "Pale Face Bao Zheng Ting" in proper Chinese title. In the movie Stephen plays a descendant of Bao Zheng called "Bao Sing" living in Qing Dynasty, whose family lost its once glorious prestige due to generation of incompetence and corruption.

Andy Lau in 2003 movie, Cat And Mouse potrayed Zhan Zhao, a court officer under Judge Bao who received order to pursue five mouse. Judge Bao was played by Anthony Wong;

LSDJ is an electronic/trip hop artist from Portland, OR. He has released 2 albums (Reflections in 2005 & Trip The Anarchy in 2006) on his own Purple Sky Records label.

Borrowing equally from the worlds of jazz, techno, hip hop & rock, LSDJ is a cut chemist of musical ideas that evoke dark, film noir settings. Equally at ease with the blissful aspects of music, LSDJ's style can take a 180-degree turn in an instant. Through his use of technology to form usually sparse (though occasionally lush) soundscapes, his music defies the current trend towards all-electronic bleeps & bloops. LSDJ prefers the natural.

His influences range from DJ Shadow to James Brown; Bach to Chicago; the Beatles to Grandaddy. It may be worth noting that LSDJ's songwriting speed may vary dramatically; he finished some of his songs in only 3 days, while other took up to five years, as was the case in some of the songs on Reflections.

West Siberian economic region (; 
tr.: Zapadno-Sibirsky ekonomichesky rayon) is one of twelve economic regions of Russia.  


This vast plain marshy and thinly populated in the north, hilly in the south is of growing economic importance. At Novosibirsk and Kamen-na-Obi are large hydroelectric stations. Other principal cities include Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk. The Kuznetsk Basin in the southwest is a center of coal mining, oil refining, and the production of iron, steel, machinery, and chemicals. The Ob-Irtysh drainage system crosses this area, which is also served by the Trans-Siberian and South Siberian rail lines. Barnaul is a major rail junction. Agricultural products include wheat, rice, oats, and sugar beets, and livestock is raised. 

Composition.
Altai Krai;
Altai Republic;
Kemerovo Oblast;
Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug;
Novosibirsk Oblast;
Omsk Oblast;
Tomsk Oblast;
Tyumen Oblast;
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug;

Socio-economic indicators.
The official economic statistics give a positive profile to this region. Not only is GDP in total high due to its substantial total population, but also reported GDP per capita is almost half again the Russian mean, as is industrial productivity. In keeping with this, wage levels are a third above the national average.  However, the likelihood of getting paid in full is 14% below the national level.  The region's economy is, moreover, relatively low in privatized ex-state enterprises, and only average in new private sector employment.

Levels of social welfare are close to the national mean in terms of life expectancy for men and women, and the proportion of students in higher education. However, popular attitudes in the region give a negative picture of West Siberia. Compared to other regions, people are much less likely to expect life to improve, and are even more negative in their rating of the national economy.

<doc id="1107372" title="Manchester Black" nonfiltered="266" processed="264" dbindex="1500271">


Manchester Black is a fictional character, and an anti-hero in the DC Comics universe. He was created by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke in Action Comics #775, March (2001).

Fictional character biography.
He was English, as shown by his accent and his omnipresent Union Jack T-shirt. Very little is known about his background; what little that is known include insinuations that he was abused both physically and sexually by his parents while growing up. Manchester later says that he grew up hating traditional heroes, especially those who believed in high moral concepts such as never killing under any circumstances. 

Elite.
Black first appears as the leader of a team of super-powered antiheroes known as The Elite, who gained worldwide popularity for viciously killing their foes. Superman opposed this wanton violence, leading to a showdown on Jupiter's moon Io that was videotaped for the Earth's media. Black used his powers to give Superman a stroke, and his teammates (Coldcast, Menagerie and the Hat) apparently were able to destroy Superman in a giant explosion. While the Elite were gloating, however, Superman used his superspeed to seemingly kill all the team members, except for Black; Superman then disabled the Englishman by using his x-ray vision to locate an unusual growth on Black's brain. He identified the growth as the source of Black's powers, and then carefully fired a thin burst of heat vision through Black's retinas and told Black that he had cut out the growth (he had actually given Black a micro-concussion that left him temporarily powerless). Faced with the apparent loss of his powers, Black actually wept. Superman then revealed to the suddenly powerless Black that the rest of the Elite were only unconscious, he had not removed anything from Black's brain, and that murdering opponents makes a hero no better than his enemies.

Suicide Squad.
A temporarily beaten Black was taken into custody, and his mental powers restored themselves over the next few months. His next appearance was part of the Our Worlds At War storyline in Adventures of Superman #593. Black was hired by the American government and President Lex Luthor to lead a new Suicide Squad featuring Chemo, Plasmus, Shrapnel and Steel (John Henry Irons). The Squad's mission was to release the monster Doomsday against the threat of the galactic conqueror Imperiex. However, Doomsday apparently killed the Squad upon his release, with the exception of Black, who escaped.

Suicide.
Black's final appearance was in the Ending Battle storyline running through the Superman titles in November and December of 2002. This storyline featured Black mentally controlling dozens of supervillains by revealing Superman's secret identity and sending them en masse after the Man of Steel. Superman manages to hold the villains back, and then finds Black in his apartment, apparently having killed Superman's wife Lois Lane. Black taunts Superman and goads him into killing him, but Superman puts Lois' body first and gives her a proper burial. Despite fantasizing about killing Black, Superman resists temptation and tells Black that he will devote the rest of his life to keeping the villain behind bars, not in the morgue. Black is stunned at Superman's fortitude, and as his spirit wavers, his mental spell crumbles, and it is revealed that Lois is still alive. The supervillains forget that Superman is really Clark Kent, and Black then takes his own life, distraught that he has himself become a villain.

Manchester's sister Vera Black is currently the leader of the Justice League Elite team of superheroes.

Powers & Abilities.
Black was an incredibly gifted telekinetic and telepath and was capable of amazingly precise use of his telekinesis. He was able to give Superman the equivalent of a stroke, for example, by telekinetically pinching blood vessels in Superman's brain. ;
He was also able to create very detailed illusions on a vast scale, and telepathically control thousands of people at the same time.

Trivia.
Manchester and Vera Black & The Elite were originally based upon Jenny Sparks & The Authority.

Publication.
Some of Black's appearances have been reprinted in a trade paperback:
 Justice League Elite (reprints: Action Comics #775, JLA #100, JLA Secret Files 2004 (lead story), and Justice League Elite #1-4, tpb, 208 pages, 2005, Titan ISBN 1-84576-191-X DC,  ISBN 1-4012-0481-3);

<doc id="1371969" title="United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company" nonfiltered="269" processed="267" dbindex="1500274">
 

The United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company was part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system in New Jersey, including their main line to New York City (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor). Prior to 1872, its main lines were the Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C&A), the first railroad in New Jersey and one of the first in the U.S., and the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company (NJRR), the first railroad across the New Jersey Palisades. The C&A first purchased and operated the oldest surviving operable steam locomotive in the world today, the John Bull. The United Company also included the Delaware and Raritan Canal, an early foe and then friend of the C&A.

History.


The first railroad charter in the United States was issued February 6, 1815 to the New Jersey Railroad Company on behalf of John Stevens and others. Based on turnpike charters, it allowed the company to build between New Brunswick and Trenton, and became a model for railroad charters in the future. That company never did anything, but the idea evolved into the later NJRR, chartered in 1832.

Camden and Amboy: 1830-1834.

The Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company was chartered on February 4, 1830, on the same day as the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, after the two competing companies had come to a compromise. The C&A and D&R had the same goals - to connect the Delaware River, serving Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with the Raritan River, for access to New York City. The D&R was built to the west of the original C&A, leaving the Delaware at Trenton and running roughly northeast to New Brunswick on the Raritan, while the original C&A ran from Camden, across the Delaware from Philadelphia, to South Amboy on Raritan Bay.

The C&A was organized on April 28 in Camden, and surveys began June 16. As railroads were a relatively new invention, rails and locomotives were bought from England. Construction began December 4, 1830 at Bordentown on the Delaware River; construction efforts were largely carried out by horse-drawn carriages. The John Bull arrived at Bordentown on September 4, 1831 and was first tested November 12. The first section, from Stewarts Point Wharf near Bordentown north to Hightstown, was opened to the public on October 1, 1832, being operated by horse at first. Service between Philadelphia and New York City was provided by steamboats, and a stagecoach trip was used between Hightstown and South Amboy. The trip cost $3 and ran in 9.5 hours, 1-2 hours faster than other routes. The rest of the line to South Amboy opened December 17, allowing for the elimination of the stagecoach transfer, but the Delaware soon froze on December 27, requiring stagecoach operation south of Bordentown. Freight service began January 24, 1833. Regular locomotive operation by the John Bull began September 9 of that year. In Fall 1833 the line was extended south to Delanco, and the full line to Camden was completed December 19, 1834.

Jersey City to Trenton: 1832-1839.
On March 7, 1832 the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company (NJRR) was chartered as a parallel line to the C&A, beginning at Jersey City, closer to New York City, but was limited to building south to New Brunswick due to the C&A's influence; the C&A would build the part from New Brunswick south to Spotswood (changed to Trenton in 1836 due to the alliance with the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad).

In November 1832 the NJRR acquired control of the Newark Turnpike, which paralleled the planned alignment east of Newark, to avoid problems caused by competition. The stock of the Essex and Middlesex Turnpike, running south from Newark to New Brunswick, was bought April 6, 1833; the majority of the line was built directly along the turnpike. The alignment as originally planned crossed the Passaic River on the Centre Street Bridge, then curved south along Park Place and Broad Street directly into the turnpike. A branch would have run from the west end of the bridge south along the river and then southwest to the main line at the south end of Broad Street, but this became the main line and the original plan along Broad Street was never built.

On November 24, 1833 the NJRR bought out the Proprietors of the Bridges over the Rivers Passaic and Hackensack, who had monopolies on their bridges over the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers (on the Newark Turnpike), in order to eliminate their threat. Around 1852, the NJRR acquired the Newark Plank Road and Ferry Company (incorporated 1849) to keep the Passaic and Hackensack monopoly.

Regular NJRR service began September 15, 1834 between Newark and Jersey City, using a temporary track over Bergen Hill. An extension to Elizabeth opened December 21, 1835, using the turnpike from the south end of Broad Street. Service to Rahway began January 1, 1836, again along the turnpike from a point south of Elizabeth. Locomotives were only used south of Newark until January 11, though some horse power operations continued east of Newark. The line opened to east of New Brunswick July 11, with an omnibus transfer the rest of the way; the turnpike was used north of Iselin. On September 8, 1836 the NJRR acquired a majority of stock of the New Brunswick Bridge Company to avoid its local monopoly over crossings of the Raritan River. The double-deck bridge over the Raritan opened October 31, 1837, with a road beneath the railroad, taking the NJRR to New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Bridge Company was authorized to charge a toll on the lower level on May 7, 1838. The old 1795 Albany Street Bridge was removed in 1849, but was later rebuilt.

The Bergen Hill Cut, the last part of the Jersey City-New Brunswick line to be finished, opened January 22, 1838, replacing the old temporary alignment over the hill and ending the use of horse power.

On March 15, 1837 a supplement to the C&A's charter was passed, allowing the branch to New Brunswick connecting with the New Jersey Rail Road to branch off of the C&A at Bordentown rather than Spotswood, to pass through Trenton for a connection with the Trenton Delaware Bridge and the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad. Portions could be built next to the Delaware and Raritan Canal or along the New Brunswick and Trenton Turnpike.

Construction on the branch began in September 1837 between Bordentown and Trenton, where it was built on the east bank of the D&R Canal. The initial branch opened April 4, 1838. Construction on the extension to New Brunswick began June of that year, opening January 1, 1839. The branch continued northeast from Trenton on the east bank of the canal, splitting at Kingston and running cross-country to Millstone Junction, southwest of New Brunswick. That same day, the NJRR was completed from New Brunswick to Millstone Junction. Despite forming one third of the route, the NJRR only got one sixth of the earnings from the joint operation, which ran between Philadelphia and New York City in 5.5 hours (down from 6 hours 50 minutes via South Amboy).

Further connections and realignments: 1839-1867.
By 1841, a connection opened between the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad and the C&A's Trenton Branch, including a bridge over the Delaware and Raritan Canal in Trenton; this allowed for through Philadelphia-Jersey City operation, but most traffic continued to run via Camden due to the distance between the P&T's Kensington terminal and Center City Philadelphia.

On May 31, 1854 the C&A decided to realign the Trenton Branch between Trenton and Deans Pond due to bad soil conditions on the current line on the bank of the D&R Canal; a plank road would be built to connect to Princeton, which the new alignment would bypass. A tunnel under the canal in Trenton was completed in March 1860 (for the line between the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad and the new alignment). Construction on the new line began October 1862; the Clinton Street Station on the new line at Trenton opened April 20, 1863, replacing the old State Street Station. The first train ran through the new tunnel on October 5, 1863, and the new line opened November 23, cutting New York City-Trenton time to 2.5 hours. The second track on the new line opened September 1864, but the old line remained for southbound freight. The Princeton Branch opened May 29, 1865, on which date passenger trains stopped running over the old line. The old line was removed between Trenton and Princeton in July; a portion in Trenton was kept to serve businesses. The part from Princeton north to Kingston was removed in September on the start of freight operations on the Princeton Branch; and the part north of Kingston (which was not next to the canal) was kept to serve the Rocky Hill Railroad.

Other companies' use of the line to Jersey City.
Closely tied to the early NJRR was the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad, later the main line of the Erie Railroad. The P&HR agreed in June 1833 to build to the west side of the New Jersey Palisades at Marion Junction, where it would use the NJRR's Bergen Hill Cut the rest of the way to the Hudson River. The P&HR opened November 29, 1833, prior to the opening of any part of the NJRR, in the meantime using a stagecoach along the Newark Turnpike to reach the river. A trackage rights agreement was made October 10, 1834, and P&HR operation to Jersey City began October 20. The Long Dock Tunnel opened April 15, 1861, giving the P&HR (by then part of the Erie) its own route to the Hudson River.

Also involved with the NJRR was the Morris and Essex Railroad, later the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's main line. On October 21, 1836 the NJRR agreed to carry M&E traffic between Newark and Jersey City, beginning November 19. A new alignment meeting the NJRR in Harrison opened August 5, 1854. On October 14, 1863, the M&E began using the Long Dock Tunnel.

The Central Railroad of New Jersey also used the NJRR to reach Jersey City from Elizabeth until its own line opened on August 1, 1864.

Monopoly and competition.
The C&A often used legislative and legal means to protect its monopoly on New York City-Philadelphia travel. The monopoly was finally broken on May 1, 1876 with the completion of the National Railway, over seven years after the legal monopoly expired.

On January 19, 1831 New Jersey passed a supplement to the D&R Canal's charter, allowing them to build a railroad alongside their canal. However, this was soon mooted by the union between the C&A and D&R. On February 15, 1831, the C&A and D&H were combined as the Joint Companies, with all important decisions made by a Joint Board, and all stock was consolidated.

An act passed February 4, 1831 gave the C&A monopoly powers for nine years against railroads built within three miles of the C&A, in exchange for the state receiving 1000 shares of stock. The "Protection Act", passed March 2, 1832, expanded this to give the Joint Companies a monopoly on New York City-Philadelphia traffic across New Jersey. On March 16, 1854 this exclusive right was extended to January 1, 1869, as long as the C&A helped other railroads including the West Jersey Railroad and double-tracked its main line.

In Summer 1835 Robert F. Stockton bought control of the Trenton Delaware Bridge and Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad to end its competition with the C&A and the legal battle to connect at New Brunswick with the NJRR. On October 12 the C&A/D&R Joint Board authorized a purchase of the P&T, and an agreement was signed November 11, by which the P&T would send all traffic beyond Trenton to New York City via the C&A. A pro-C&A board was elected by the P&T on January 12, 1836, and on June 1 the stock of all three companies was divided .

On September 1, 1862 a competing line began operating via the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad and Camden and Atlantic Railroad, running steamboats between New York City and Port Monmouth at the north end of the R&DB. This common threat caused the C&A and NJRR to work more closely, signing an agreement October 1.

The Newark and New York Railroad, later part of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, opened in July 1869, giving major competition to the NJRR from Newark east.

Consolidation and PRR lease: 1867-.
On February 1, 1867, after much back-and-forth bickering, the C&A and NJRR were informally joined as the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Companies. The Pennsylvania Railroad approved a lease of the UNJ on May 15, 1871, and the UNJ approved May 19. The lease was made December 1 and the PRR began operating the UNJ that day, though the lease was retroactive to July 1. On May 18, 1872 the C&A, D&R Canal and NJRR were consolidated, forming the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company. The new company was split into two divisions - the New York Division consisted of the NJRR and the C&A Trenton Branch towards Philadelphia, while the Amboy Division was the original C&A main line.

Other branches.
The Burlington and Mount Holly Railroad and Transportation Company opened in 1849, providing a branch from Burlington southeast to Mount Holly. From opening it was controlled by the C&A.

The Belvidere Delaware Railroad, also controlled by the C&A, opened in stages from 1851 to 1855, running north from Trenton to Belvidere. The BDRR was leased to the UNJ on January 1, 1876.

The Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad opened in 1853 from the C&A at Jamesburg east to Freehold, also under C&A control. In January 1866 a connecting line opened between the new Trenton Branch at Monmouth Junction and the original main line at Jamesburg. That line, built under the F&J charter, was transferred to the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company on July 29, 1874. A July 16, 1879 agreement leased the F&J to the UNJ from June 1, 1879.

The Millstone and New Brunswick Railroad opened in 1854, running west from the south end of the NJRR at Millstone Junction to Millstone. The M&NB was bought on April 21, 1915 at foreclosure.

A branch to Bonhampton opened in 1860.

In 1864 the Perth Amboy and Woodbridge Railroad, operated by the NJRR, opened as a branch from Rahway south to Perth Amboy. A June 26, 1889 agreement leased the PA&W to the UNJ from January 1, 1891.

The Rocky Hill Railroad and Transportation Company opened in 1864 as a branch of the C&A from Kingston on the old alignment north to Rocky Hill. The C&A leased it November 22, 1869 and began operating it June 1, 1870.

The Camden and Burlington County Railroad, running east from Camden to Mount Holly, opened in 1867 under C&A operation. In 1868 the C&A leased the Vincentown Branch of Burlington County Railroad, and soon after formally leased the C&BC.

The Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad opened from the C&A at Hightstown south to Pemberton in 1868, under lease and operation by the C&A.

The NJRR was authorized to acquire underwater land at Harsimus Cove on March 30, 1868. That land became a major freight terminal, served by the Harsimus Branch.

In 1869 the Mount Holly, Lumberton and Medford Railroad opened under C&A lease, running south from Mount Holly to Medford.

In April 1870 a new direct line opened across the Passaic River, bypassing the Centre Street Bridge. The old bridge remained for freight and to serve downtown. Included in the new line was a new station at Market Street, now Newark Penn Station.

The Columbus, Kinkora and Springfield Railroad was leased March 11, 1871. The Mercer and Somerset Railroad was leased October 1, 1871.

In 1872 a short branch was built at Florence to serve a foundry on the Delaware River.

The Millham Branch, opened in 1876, connected the old and new alignments northeast of Trenton.

Two branches in Kearny were acquired, the Meadows Branch being built 1917-1918 by the UNJ and the Meadows Branch No. 2 being bought October 15, 1917 from Newark Factory Sites, Inc.

The line today.
The original C&A alignment and the Trenton Branch from Pavonia Yard in Camden to Trenton was, up until 1999, Conrail's Bordentown Secondary, and is presently NJ Transit's River Line diesel LRT system (although freight still operates overnight under a FRA waiver). The rest of the Trenton Branch is now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The original line from Bordentown to Robbinsville is Conrail's Robbinsville Industrial Track. Track has been removed from Robbinsville to Hightstown; the rest of the line to South Amboy is Conrail's Hightstown Branch (south of Jamesburg) and Amboy Secondary.

The Princeton Branch is still used by New Jersey Transit for passengers. The old alignment in Trenton is still used for freight; the old alignment from Kingston to Monmouth Junction has been removed. The Florence Branch still exists.

West of Kearny Junction, the line is part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. From Kearny Junction east to the east side of the Palisades, PATH and Conrail's Passaic and Harsimus Line occupy the right-of-way, side by side. East of the Palisades, the elevated structure to Exchange Place Terminal has been largely torn down, as has the elevated structure to Harsimus Cove (with the exception of the embankment), but PATH follows the alignment of the former underground. Only the easternmost part of the Centre Street Branch remains; the Bonhampton Branch, later the Bonhamtown Branch, is still used for freight.

John Lethbridge (1675 1759) invented the first underwater diving machine in 1715. He lived in the county of Devon in South West England and reportedly had 17 children.

John Lethbridge was a wool merchant based in Newton Abbot who invented a diving machine in 1715 that was used to salvage valuables from wrecks. This machine was an air tight oak barrel that allowed  the diver  to submerge long enough to retrieve underwater material. In Lethbridge s words:

 It is made of wainscot perfectly round, about 6 feet in length, about 2 feet and a half diameter at the head, and about 18 inches diameter at the foot, and contains about 30 gallons; it is hooped with iron hoops without and within to guard against pressure. There are two holes for the arms, and a glass about 4 inches diameter, and an ich and a quarter thick to look though, which is fixed in the bottom part, so as to be in a direct line with the eye, two airholes upon the upper part, into one of which air is conveyed by a pair of bellows, both which are stopt with plugs immediately before going down to the bottom. At the foot part there s a hole to let out water. Sometimes there s a large rope fixed to the back or upper part, by which it s let down, and there s a little line called the signal line, by which the people above are directed what to do, and under is fix d a piece of timber as a guard for the glass. I go in with my feet foremost, and when my arms are got through the holes, then the head is put on, which is fastened with screws. It requires 500 weight to sink it, and take but 15 pound weight from it and it will buoy upon the surface of the water. I lie straight upon my breast all the time I am in the engine, which hath many times been more than 6 hours, being frequently refreshed upon the surface by a pair of bellows. I can move it about 12 foot square at the bottom, where I have stayed many times 34 minutes. I have been 10 fathoms deep many a hundred times, and have been 12 fathom, but with great difficulty 

After testing this machine in his garden pond (specially built for the purpose) Lethbridge dived on a number of wrecks   4 English men of war, 1 East Indiaman (both English and Dutch), 2 Spanish galleons and a number of galleys. He became very wealthy as a result of his salvages. One of his better known recoveries was on the Dutch Slotter Hooge which had sunk off Madeira with over 3 tons of silver on board.

Lethbridge was buried in Wolborough church, Newton Abbot.

Survivor: Fiji is the fourteenth season of CBS reality television series 
Survivor.

Applications were due June 16, 2006. In late July and early August, about 800 applicants were selected for an interview by CBS. Out of those 800, about 48 semi-finalists were selected to go to Los Angeles in September.

Survivor: Fiji started with 19 players.  For the first two days, there were no tribes, similar to , and they were instructed to construct a well-off camp from given materials.  During the third day, two tribes were formed.

The losing team of the immunity challenge had to move to a different camp site with nothing but a machete and a cooking pot, while the winning tribe returned to the luxurious camp.

Exile Island is also in play for Survivor: Fiji.  However, unlike previous seasons, the hidden idol is not present on the island, though clues to its location are given to those that are exiled.

The premiere of this season of Survivor, entitled "Something Cruel is About to Happen... Real Soon," aired on February 8, 2007.


The way the idols will be used has been changed so that they must be used before the votes are read, but after the castaways have voted and in an interview, Jeff Probst stated that both will be used. The promo also mentioned a major twist that will "drastically complicate the game" and a very controversial decision by one of the contestants "that will have America talking."


Melissa McNulty, a 28-year-old talent manager from Los Angeles, would have been the twentieth castaway but dropped out and returned home the night before the show began because of panic attacks . Because of the timing and lack of alternates, her spot could not be replaced.




Contestants.


Sylvia was given the task of dividing the tribes. She was sent to Exile Island and told she would join whichever tribe lost the Immunity Challenge after that tribe voted off a member. Because Ravu lost the Immunity Challenge, Sylvia became a member of Ravu.

The game.



In the case of multiple tribes or people who win reward or immunity, they are listed in order of finish, or alphabetically where it was a team effort; where one player won and invited others, the invitees are in brackets.;

The challenge was a combined reward and immunity challenge.

Elimination notes.
Jessica - After Ravu's loss at the reward/immunity challenge, they were sent to a new camp to start from scratch.  Rocky, Erica, and Jessica formed a strong alliance, while the other 6 formed a looser alliance.  Jessica was voted off 6-1-1-1, being thought of as "flying under the radar" and causing the tribe to lose the challenge.

Exile notes.
Sylvia - Being an architect, Sylvia took control of building the shelter with the materials given to the castaways.  When Jeff Probst asked the castaways who was the leader in building the shelter, they unanimously said that Sylvia was the leader.  Jeff then asked her to divide the other 18 people into two tribes.  After finishing this, she was sent to Exile Island, where she would get the first clue, and be immune from Tribal Council.  She would then join the tribe that lost the upcoming challenge.  While at Exile Island, she found out that one of the hidden immunity idols was at her camp, not on the island.  She would join the Ravu tribe when she returns from Exile Island.

Voting history.



Episode summaries.
Episode 1: The castaways arrived on an island with no instructions and were not split into tribes.  After some time, a box was parachuted, which contained plans for a luxurious shelter using the provided building supplies.  The castaways spent the next two days constructing the shelter from the plans under the primary direction of Sylvia.  At the combined Reward and Immunity Challenge, the castaways were asked who the leader was during construction and unanimously said it was Sylvia.  Sylvia was told to split the castaways into two tribes but was then exiled.  She would be immune from Tribal Council and would join whichever tribe lost the Immunity Challenge.  Ravu lost the challenge and was sent to a new island with only one pot and a machete.  Moto returned to the original tribe to live in the shelter built on days one and two with additional amenities.  Rocky, Erica, and Jessica formed a strong alliance, while the other six formed a looser alliance. Jessica was blamed for losing the challenge and being under the radar.  She was voted out 6-1-1-1.

Political turmoil in Fiji.
On December 5, 2006 (about two days before the final tribal council), a coup d'état was started by Fiji's military leader, Commodore Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama. While there was some speculation that a full evacuation of the Survivor crew members from Fiji would take place, only a few crew members on the mainland were relocated to the second smallest island.

International broadcast.
For viewers in the Philippines, Survivor: Fiji will now be shown on the Solar-owned cable channel Crime/Suspense. According to the promo, the live feed telecast will be at 3 PM and the primetime replay is at 10 PM the same day. It will start on February 9, 2007. Survivor's first 13 seasons were shown on free TV channel Studio 23.

Kendall Stewart (born 1953) represents District 45 in the New York City Council. 

Born in St. Vincent, and educated at Caribbean Union College, Stewart's original profession is podiatry.  

He first ran for office in this district-which was designed in order to maximize the political clout of the large West Indian constituency that lies within this area, i.e. Flatlands, Flatbush, East Flatbush, and Midwood-in 1997 against then incumbent City Councilman Lloyd Henry. 

Although he was defeated in that race Stewart would go on to successfully contest the seat four years later in a crowded Democratic primary field, which included two other Caribbean-American candidates, and future State Senator Kevin Parker. 

As the incumbent from that district, Stewart would face a tough re-election battle in 2004 when Samuel Taitt, who has become a perennial political rival for Stewart, decided to run against him for the seat yet again.  

One of the issues raised over the course of the campaign was a comment Stewart made that his opponents, as well as many Haitian-Americans, viewed as being derogatory towards Haitians. In response to an article publised in the Daily News, which accused him of being a delinquent landlord, he asserted that the poor condition of his rental properties were the result of the behavior of Haitian-Americans. He also accused them of breaking locks, which he described as a "cultural thing."  

In addition to comments that his opponents-and others-deemed to be culturally insensitive, Stewart was also taken to task for his stewardship of several large apartment complexes, which prompted his controversial remarks. 

Stewart was also chastised by his opponent in multiple re-election races for endorsing Governor George Pataki, and opposing legislation in the City Council that some Democrats viewed as vital to ensuring the protection of consumer protection laws and tenants' rights. 

During Sam Taitt's rematch against Councilman Stewart in 2005 he insinuated that Stewart's campaign might have been behind defamatory campaign pamphlets circulated within the district one week prior to Election Day, a charge that Stewart's campaign vehemently denied. 

In addition to his role on the City Council, Stewart has also been Democratic District Leader for the 58th Assembly District. 

He is an alumnus of City College, and New York College of Podiatric Medicine.

Henri Georges de France (7 September 1911 Paris   29 April 1996 Paris) was an influential French television engineer. He was the author of the 819 line standard, the inventor of SECAM and apparently behind the HD-MAC high-definition standard.

On December 6, 1931, he founded the Compagnie Générale de Télévision in Le Havre and develops television sets using a vertical definition of 60 lines. 

In February 1932, de France makes several transmissions over a distance of 7 kilometers from the Radio-Normandie station in Fécamp. His signals can be received by a few people located at over 100 kilometres away. In October 1932, he obtains a definition of 120 lines. 
In 1956 he patents the SECAM color television system. On October 1, 1967 at 2:15pm CET, la deuxième chaîne switched broadcast from black and white to color using SECAM.

De France died in January 1996. Interred at Jarnac, the same town where former president François Mitterrand lies.

<doc id="4976550" title="Bomphiologia" nonfiltered="281" processed="279" dbindex="1500286">
Bomphiologia, also known as verborum bombus, is a rhetorical technique wherein the speaker brags excessively.



History.
The term verborum bombus is used by the sixteenth-century English rhetorician Richard Sherry in his 1550 book A treatise of Schemes & Tropes. In it, Sherry says


Verborum bombus, when small & triflyng thynges are set out wyth great gasyng wordes.  Example of this have you in Terrence of the boasting souldiar.


Sherry mentions the miles gloriosus character from the plays of the Roman playwright Plautus. The miles gloriosus (meaning "braggart soldier") is a stock character from Plautus established in a play by Plautus. The miles gloriosus was a soldier who, although a coward, bragged excessively about past experiences. 

The most famous miles gloriosus in theatre is probably Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff. Falstaff is a fat old knight in the service of the English king who brags about his battle experiences, despite being cowardly and adverse to battle. In one scene, Falstaff says 


I would to god my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion (Henry IV, Part 2 1.2.218-221). 


Falstaff here is lamenting the fact that because his name is so terrifying, enemies avoid fighting him. This is obviously bomphiologia on Falstaff's part.

Uses.
Bomphiologia can be used to comic effect, as in the above hyperbolic instance with the character of Falstaff. This is an ironic use of the term, because Falstaff is an old, fat drunkard -obviously in no condition to be scaring enemies as he claims to be.

Edgar Allan Poe used bomphiologia as a part of his style. One instance of this is in the following passage


two cats ... alighting opposite one another on my visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the paltry consideration of my nose. ("Loss of Breath" 2:159)


This could have been simply stated, "Two cats fought over my nose." Instead, Poe presents a more stylized version which fills out the personality of his narrator. It lets the reader know that the story is told by an unreliable narrator who is prone to exaggeration.

Stephen and Timothy Quay (born 17 June 1947 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, United States), are American identical twin brothers better known as the Brothers Quay or Quay Brothers. They are influential stop-motion animators.  

They reside and work in England where they moved in the late 1960s (after studying illustration in Philadelphia) to study at the Royal College of Art where they made their first short films (which no longer exist after the only print was irreparably damaged). They spent some time in the Netherlands in the 1970s and then returned to England where they teamed up with another Royal College student, Keith Griffiths, who produced all of their films.  The trio formed Koninck Studios in 1980, which is currently based in Southwark, south London.

The Quays' works (1979-present) show a wide range of often esoteric influences, starting with the Polish animators Walerian Borowczyk and Jan Lenica and continuing with the writers Franz Kafka, Bruno Schulz, Robert Walser and Michel de Ghelderode, puppeteers Wladyslaw Starewicz and Richard Teschner and composers Leo¨ Janá ek, Zden k Li¨ka and Leszek Jankowski, the last of whom has created many original scores for their work.  Czech animator Jan ¦vankmajer, for whom they named one of their films (The Cabinet of Jan ¦vankmajer), is also frequently cited as a major influence, but they actually discovered his work relatively late, in 1983, by which time their characteristic style and preoccupations had been fully formed. 

Most of their films feature dolls, often partially disassembled, in a dark, moody atmosphere. Perhaps their best known work is Street Of Crocodiles, based on the short story of the same name by the Polish author and artist Bruno Schulz. This short film was selected by director and animator Terry Gilliam as one of the ten best animated films of all time, and critic Jonathan Romney included it on his list of the ten best films in any medium (for Sight and Sound's 2002 critics' poll). They have made two feature-length live action films: Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life and The Piano Tuner Of Earthquakes. They also directed an animated sequence in the film Frida.

With very few exceptions, their films have no meaningful spoken dialogue most have no spoken content at all, while some, like The Comb (1990) include multilingual background gibberish that is not supposed to be coherently understood.  Accordingly, their films are highly reliant on their music scores, many of which have been written especially for them by the Polish composer Leszek Jankowski.  In 2000, they contributed a short film to the BBC's Sound On Film series in which they visualised a 20-minute piece by the avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen.  Whenever possible, the Quays prefer to work with pre-recorded music, though Gary Tarn's score for The Phantom Museum had to be added afterwards when it proved impossible to licence music by the Czech composer Zden k Li¨ka. 

They have created music videos for His Name Is Alive ("Are We Still Married", "Can't Go Wrong Without You"), Michael Penn ("Long Way Down (Look What the Cat Drug In)") and 16 Horsepower ("Black Soul Choir").  Some people mistakenly believe that the Quays are responsible for several music videos for Tool, but those videos were created by Fred Stuhr and member Adam Jones, whose work is influenced by the Quays.  Although they worked on Peter Gabriel's seminal video "Sledgehammer" (1986) as animators, this was directed by Stephen R. Johnson and the Quays were unhappy with their contribution, believing it to be too imitative of ¦vankmajer's work than truly distinctive in its own right.

Their work also includes decors for the Theatre and Opera productions of director Richard Jones: Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges; Feydeau's "A Flea in Her Ear"; Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa; and Molière's "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.". Their set design for Ionesco's "The Chairs" was nominated for a Tony Award in 1998.  

Before turning to film, they worked as professional illustrators.  The first edition of Anthony Burgess' novel "The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End", features their drawings before the start of each chapter.  Nearly three decades before directly collaborating with Stockhausen, they designed the cover of the book  (ed. Jonathan Cott, Simon & Schuster, 1973).

Vienna/Fairfax-GMU is a Washington Metro station in Fairfax County, Virginia on the Orange Line. This is the western end of the Orange Line. Service began on June 7, 1986. The station was originally named Vienna, but was renamed in 1999.

Vienna/Fairfax-GMU station is located in Oakton, Virginia in the median of Interstate 66 at Nutley Street.  It provides easy access to the nearby Town of Vienna, the City of Fairfax, and the main campus of George Mason University.  

This is also a major station for commuters from the western suburbs of Washington, DC.  The station is serviced by Metrobus, Fairfax Connector buses, and CUE buses. There are 5,849 parking spaces across two garages and three other lots that support "park and ride" commuters.

In line with high-density development, the Fairlee Metro-West project aims to increase the housing density around the Vienna/Fairfax-GMU station from 60 single family homes to 2250 condominiums and townhouses.  This development has been controversial, as many Orange Line commuters believe the system will be pushed beyond capacity at rush hours as a result.

Jacques Aymar-Vernay (17th century) was a stonemason from the village of Saint Marcellin in Dauphiné, France, who reintroduced dowsing with a divining rod into popular usage in Europe. He claimed to have discovered springs and treasures hidding in the earth using his rod, and even tracked down criminals using it. According to some accounts, when he neared the scene of a murder using divining rod, he would break into a sweat, shudder, and in some instances, even faint.

Youth for Equality (YFE) is an Indian organization involved with the 2006 anti-reservation protests, working to counter the Government of India's move to implement 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in institutes of higher education (twenty central universities, the IITs, IIMs and 9 premier medical colleges like AIIMS and JIPMER).

Organization.
On April 5, 2006, Human Resources and Development minister of India, Arjun Singh, announced to the media that the government intended to introduce reservations for OBCs by 27% in central colleges, including IITs, IIMs, AIIMS, JIPMER, Delhi University, and many others. Youth for Equality was conceived by students at University College of Medical Sciences expressing discontent over the proposal; other founding members include students from AIIMS, LHMC (Lady Hardinge Medical College), VMMC (Vardhman Mahavir Medical College) and MAMC (Maulana Azad Medical College).

As of June 2006, YFE's website states that it has over 16,000 members, and links to 12 regional chapter weblogs. The group's membership includes medical students and professionals, students at public and private colleges (including IITs, IIMs and JNU), parents of students, Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs) (under the banner of United Residents Joint Action), and corporate bodies.

Activities.

The Youth for Equality group was mainly responsible for the anti-reservation protests in 2006. Its activities were very successful and its call for strike got nation-wide support crippling the medical infrastructure of India. In addition to complete roll-back of the proposed reservation, the striking protesters have demanded that an expert committee comprising members from non-political organisations to review the existing reservation policy and find out whether reservation for OBCs is required at all. Also, they demand that no penal action be taken against the protesters and publication of a white paper by the government, making its stand clear on reservation. The indefinite hunger strike organized by YFE was also very successful with nearly 150 students joining the hunger strike that enters the ninth day as on 23 May 2006.  Resident doctors from all over India joined the protests crippling the health infrastructure of a number of cities.. This caused great human suffering, and lead the Supreme Court to criticise the doctors.

<doc id="7122470" title="Salt (novel)" nonfiltered="290" processed="288" dbindex="1500295">




Salt is a novel by British science fiction author Adam Roberts.

=Plot introduction=
Colonists from Earth set out for a distant planet, but during the voyage, a factional skirmish turns into an irrevocable grudge, to play out during the course of their colonisation.  Rough-shod settlements are soon constructed about the sterile salt environment, yet old tensions quickly develop into war between two of these settlements, the rigid military dictatorship of Senaar and the Als anarchy. 

The novel explores the motivations of their warfare, and the viewpoints of the two narrators illuminate a dreadful, entwined inevitability. In all aspects of theme, setting, character development and prose style, Salt is a very stark, austere composition.

=Characters in "Salt"=
Salt is narrated from the dual perspective of central characters Barlei and Petja, who function as representatives of Senaar and Als, respectively.  Barlei is a senior military official effectively a dictator beholden to the well-defined heirachy of the colony of Senaar.  Petja, a wayfaring Alsist to begin with, hardens into a charismatic terrorist, resolved to resist a Senaar campaign that uses ever flimsier pretexts to continue destruction of the Als collective.

=Awards and nominations=
Shortlisted for the 2001 Arthur C. Clarke Award.

The NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs of 2001 are memorable mainly because those playoffs were the last  for defenseman Ray Bourque, who retired directly after the playoffs, but he won the Stanley Cup that year with the Colorado Avalanche, so his retirement was fitting given all the empty years playing for the Boston Bruins.

On the same team, Patrick Roy would hoist the Stanley Cup for the last time on-ice, as well.

Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.

New Jersey Devils v. Carolina Hurricanes.

The eighth seeds always get underdog status in the first rounds of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, especially when the opponent is a Martin Brodeur-led, first-seed New Jersey Devils, and the hype against the last-seed Carolina Hurricanes was confirmed by a three games to zero lead by the Devils.  The Hurricanes were shut out in two of those three losses, and the first game was lost by four goals, but the Hurricanes seemed resilient, coming back in game four and game five with victories of one-goal margins.  Game four featured Hurricanes center Rod Brind'Amour scoring the game-winning, overtime goal to give their team its first win of the series.  In the end, though, the Devils defeated the Hurricanes in game six by four goals, five to one.

Series Highlight.
Game One: Devils 5, Hurricanes 1;
Game Two: Devils 2, Hurricanes 0;
Game Three: Devils 4, Hurricanes 0;
Game Four: Hurricanes 3, Devils 2 (Overtime);
Game Five: Hurricanes 3, Devils 2;
Game Six: Devils 5, Hurricanes 1;


Ottawa Senators v. Toronto Maple Leafs.

The matchup between the Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs was one that left many hockey enthusiasts stunned.  The second-seed Senators took on their seventh seeded counterpart, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Senators expected to roll over the Maple Leafs, but just the reverse happened.  Game one was one of two overtime games in the series, and the first game ended with a shot from the blue line by Mats Sundin.  Game two was distinguished by the play of the Maple Leafs, leaving the Senators in the dust three goals to zero.  The second overtime game was game three where the score was tied at two goals apiece until Cory Cross scored early in the first overtime session.  The fourth game was equally punishing by the Maple Leafs as they swept the number two seed.

Series Highlight.
Game One: Maple Leafs 1, Senators 0 (Overtime);
Game Two: Maple Leafs 3, Senators 0;
Game Three: Maple Leafs 3, Senators 2 (Overtime);
Game Four: Maple Leafs 3, Senators 1;


Washington Capitals v. Pittsburgh Penguins.

After game one, a game featuring high-standard goal tending that the Capitals won, the Penguins came roaring back in games two and three, game three being highlighted by rookie Johan Hedburg's shutout performance.  Game four ended in overtime in favor of Washington, despite goals by Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux, the two superstars of Pittsburgh.  In game five, Pittsburgh came out fast with Lemieux having a goal and an assist on top of Andrew Ference's goal to win by one goal, two goals to one.  The elimination game, game six, went all the way to overtime where Martin Straka scored after stealing the puck to win the series for the Penguins, four games to two.

Series Highlight.
Game One: Capitals 1, Penguins 0;
Game Two: Penguins 2, Capitals 1;
Game Three: Penguins 3, Capitals 0;
Game Four: Capitals 4, Penguins 3 (Overtime);
Game Five: Penguins 2, Capitals 1;
Game Six: Penguins 4, Capitals 3 (Overtime);


Philadelphia Flyers v. Buffalo Sabres.

After Philadelphia got stopped by Dominik Hasek and the Sabres in the first two games, one of which was ended by a Jay McKee overtime goal, the Flyers came out in game three determined to win a game before losing the first three, and they did by one goal, but they lost again to the Sabres in game four in overtime, after Curtis Brown banged the puck past goalie Roman Cechmanek.  The Flyers prevailed in game five by a two-goal margin, but they were hammered by the Sabres in game six: they gave up a total of eight goals, five of which were surrendered by Cechmanek who was replaced early by Brian Boucher, but Boucher didn't make a difference as he gave up three goals, too.  Dominik Hasek notched another shutout performance in game six, and the Sabres moved on to the conference semifinals.

Series Highlight.
Game One: Sabres 2, Flyers 1;
Game Two: Sabres 4, Flyers 3 (Overtime);
Game Three: Flyers 3, Sabres 2;
Game Four: Sabres 4, Flyers 3 (Overtime);
Game Five: Flyers 3, Sabres 1;
Game Six: Sabres 8, Flyers 0;


Western Conference Quarterfinals.

Colorado Avalanche v. Vancouver Canucks.

Each of the first three games were decided by one goal, the first game being a high-scoring affair at five goals for the Avalanche and four goals for the Canucks.  In the overtime period of game three, Peter Forsberg sent a shot past the Canucks goal keeper, and the Avalanche strode away with a three games to zero advantage.  Game four, though, was not close in the end because Peter Forsberg, Eric Messier, and Joe Sakic scored in 38 seconds that put the game on ice.  Joe Sakic scored in each of the four games, and the Avalanche swept the Canucks, even though every game was pretty close.

Series Highlight.
Game One: Avalanche 5, Canucks 4;
Game Two: Avalanche 2, Canucks 1;
Game Three: Avalanche 4, Canucks 3 (Overtime);
Game Four: Avalanche 5, Canucks 1;


Detroit Red Wings v. Los Angeles Kings.

In what is likely one of the largest upsets in Red Wings history, the seventh-seed Kings took a first-round series from number two Detroit, and Los Angeles came back to win the rest after trailing two games to zero.  Game one and game two went to Detroit, game two coming easily by a four-goal margin, but the Kings persevered in game three behind Felix Potvin who netted 22 saves during the game.  Game four was a game for the history books: in the third period, Detroit had a three-goal lead with about six minutes to go, but they relinquished the lead to the Kings' Jozef Stumpel and crew who made a miraculous comeback to tie the game up and force it to overtime.  In the extra period, Eric Belanger scored to put the finishing touch on an amazing comeback and raise the team's spirits up with a tied series.  After losing game five in Detroit, the Red Wings traveled back to Los Angeles to lose in overtime to an Adam Deadmarsh goal that won the series for the Kings.

WinFixer, WinAntiVirus, ErrorSafe, SystemDoctor and DriveCleaner are identical or similar computer programs available for Microsoft Windows that claim to repair computer system problems. They are forcibly installed on the victim's computer by the SysProtect vector. They display false information with regards to a user's computer, thereby confusing said user into believing their PC is infected with viruses, spyware and/or other forms of malware. The adverts pop up a display with notifications to convince the user that something may be amiss with the computer, or run a fake diagnostic. The program repeatedly prompts the user to purchase a licensed copy of the program.

Due to these problems, WinFixer and its sister applications are reputed to be spyware or malware. Indeed, their misleading popups and forced downloads mirror the "marketing" strategies of many spyware programs. Some computers infected with this program exhibit sluggish performance.

Symantec's Report on Winfixer: 
McAfee's Report on Winfixer: 
Kaspersky also has it listed as mal-ware: 
Sophos' Report: 

A possible fix?: 


WinFixer's claim:

WinFixer 2005 is a useful utility to scan and fix any system, registry and hard drive errors. It ensures system stability and performance, frees wasted hard drive space and recovers damaged Word, Excel, music and video files.

In truth, WinFixer does none of these things.

 How it infects .
There are several ways in which WinFixer can infect a computer. Users using Internet Explorer are most susceptible, although users of other browsers, such as Firefox and Opera can also be infected, but are more resistant to the program. One infection method that  is browser-independent involves the trojan Trojan.Emcodec.E, a fake codec that exists in numerous versions.

 Typical Infection .
The infection usually occurs during a visit to a distributing web site (not necessarily winfixer.com) using Internet Explorer. A message appears in a Dialog Box, asking the user if they want to install WinFixer.



When the user chooses any of the options or tries to close this dialog (by clicking 'Ok' or 'Cancel' or by clicking the corner 'X'), it will trigger a pop-up window and WinFixer will download and install itself, regardless of the user s wishes. Because this is a dialog box related to the Internet Explorer application, it does not appear in the Windows Task Manager list (Ctrl+Alt+Del).  However, the user may be able to avoid installing the program either by using the Alt+f4 command or by disconnecting from the internet before closing the dialogue box.

WinFixer is able to stop a computer's optical drive from working.

Trial offer of WinFixer. 
A free, trial offer of this program is sometimes found in pop-ups.  If the trial version is downloaded and installed, it "locates" a couple of alleged Trojans and viruses, but does nothing else.  To obtain a quarantine or removal, WinFixer requires the purchase of the program.  Some reviewers believe the alleged unwanted bugs to be bogus, only serving to induce the owner to buy the program. If the WinFixer program is found, it usually will not go away without the use of Anti-Virus software. It tends to keep popping up in windows on the user's screen until removed with said software.

 WinFixer Application .
Once installed, WinFixer frequently launches pop-ups and prompts the user to follow its directions. Because of the intricate way in which the program installs itself into the host computer (including making dozens of registry edits), successful removal may take a fairly long time if done manually. When running, it can be found in the Task manager and stopped, but before long it will re-install and start up again.

 Firefox Popup .
The Mozilla Firefox browser is less vulnerable than Internet Explorer (yet not totally immune) to initial infection by WinFixer. However, once installed, WinFixer is known to exploit the SessionSaver extension for the Firefox browser. The program causes popups on every startup asking the user to download WinFixer, by adding lines containing the word 'WinFixer' to the prefs.js file.

 Non-Windows systems .
It is difficult, if not impossible, for WinFixer to install itself on a non-Windows system. The most obvious cue is its "scan" of Microsoft Windows, which demonstrates that the program is fraudulent because it runs the program like it is running a Windows program. In addition, it includes obviously "fake" browser windows that do not even match those of most non-Windows systems.

 Pop-up windows .
When a user browses the Internet and receives an alert message, it will trigger a set of 3 pop-up windows, regardless of the software type. WinFixer, ErrorSafe, or WinAntiVirus will alert the user about possible ongoing attacks. In this case, WinFixer prompts the user to use their software to scan the computer for possible worms, viruses and Trojans, etc. If the user clicks the 'X' or Cancel it will launch another pop-up, telling the user that they have not completed the scan. If the user selects any of the options, WinFixer will install itself. If the user disconnects from the Internet before clicking an option, they will get the dialog boxes, but nothing will happen.



 Avoid infection .
If the initial dialog box is shown, disconnecting from the Internet before closing it may prevent the download prompt and, therefore, the risk of infection. Shutting down all browser windows using Windows Task Manager also seems to be effective. Do not simply close the browser windows using the 'X', as it will often still auto-download - use Task Manager instead (this may not be as effective for users of a Windows OS older than 2000, however 2000 and XP users can close iexplore.exe or firefox.exe without the install taking place).

Switching to a browser other than Internet Explorer may reduce vulnerability to this and other online Trojan threats. Most malware is targeted at Internet Explorer, due to its widespread use, and thus is written to take advantage of any flaws and loopholes in its programming.

Blocking the site www.winfixer.com in your firewall will prevent the typical infecting download. However, there may be other means by which the program installs itself.

 Removing WinFixer .
There are several other products to be found on the Web that claim to have the ability to stop and uninstall WinFixer. Many of these 'solutions' are WinFixer clones.

WinFixer will prompt the user to purchase a licensed copy of the WinFixer software. Making this purchase may solve the problems caused by the application, without removing it. There is no proof that the program works, even after purchasing the license. Some users report that purchasing and installing the Winfixer program causes additional serious operating problems.

Symantec has published procedures for removing WinFixer manually. This is a manual process involving registry editing. As of January 2006, the better-known antivirus and antispyware software packages do not detect or remove WinFixer infections automatically.

McAfee's WinFixer information indicates that WinFixer may be classified as legitimate software, however, McAfee's Vundo information may aid a user in removing WinFixer. This removal process makes use of Sysinternals's Process Explorer (download here) to suspend infected critical system processes. (Vundo is malware intended to automatically install WinFixer on your machine)

Several free reputed anti-spyware programs can detect and remove WinFixer, such as Spybot - Search & Destroy and Ad-Aware.

 Domain Ownership .
The company that makes WinFixer, Winsoftware Ltd., claims to be based in Liverpool, England (Stanley Street, postcode: 13088.)  However this has been proven false .  See more on the WinSoftware page.

The domain WINFIXER.COM on the whois database shows it is owned by a void company in Ukraine thus making the company exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
. According to Alexa Internet the domain is owned by Innovative Marketing, Inc., 1876 Hutson St, Honduras.

According to the public key certificate provided by GTE CyberTrust Solutions, Inc., the server secure.errorsafe.com is operated by ErrorSafe Inc. at 1878 Hutson Street, Belize City, BZ.

 Miscellaneous and Technical Information .
 Technical .
WinFixer is closely related to Aurora Network's Nail.exe hijacker/spyware program. In worst-case scenarios, it may embed itself in Internet Explorer and become part of the program, thus being nearly impossible to remove. The program is also closely related to the Vundo and Virtumonde viruses.  - Note: The database entry for the Virtumonde Trojan and WinFixer itself are down as of late February 2006), however, a great number of forum members on on-line technical support forums and blogs believe that WinFixer is associated with the Vundo Trojan.


It puts "DllRunning" in the registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and a randomly named dll file into C:\WINDOWS\system32. For example; "ptnuscsd.dll"

 Program Name .
It is speculated that the name WinFixer is derived from the old Microsoft Windows abbreviation "Win" joined with the word fixer, thus implying it is "Windows Fixer". Because of the name association with the operating system, a hypothetical situation could occur in which a user may possibly think that they are downloading a Windows related program, when, in fact, they are not.

 Identical Programs .

Other programs have appeared on the internet under different names with advertisements similar to WinFixer's, including ErrorSafe, SystemDoctor, SysProtect, PrivacyProtector, DriveCleaner, WinAntiSpyware, ECsecured and WinAntiVirus. The popups give the same warning as WinFixer and also refuse to be ignored. In addition, their websites also share a resemblance to WinFixer's website.

 Class Action Lawsuit .
On September 29, 2006, a San Jose woman filed a lawsuit over WinFixer and related "fraudware" in Santa Clara County Superior Court.

John Brooks Henderson (November 16, 1826   April 12, 1913) was a United States Senator from Missouri and the author of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Born near Danville, Virginia, he moved with his parents to Lincoln County, Missouri, studied on his own while a farm hand, taught school, was admitted to the bar in 1844, and practiced. He was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives in 1848-1850 and 1856-1858, and was active in Democratic politics.  He was commissioned a brigadier general in the State militia in 1861.

On January 17, 1862, Henderson was appointed to the U.S. Senate as a Unionist to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of Trusten Polk.  Later that year, Henderson was elected to a full six year term in the U.S. Senate.  As a United States Senator representing a slave state, Henderson authored and sponsored the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution permanently prohibiting slavery in the United States.  Henderson's amendment was approved by the U.S. Congress on January 31, 1865, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln the following day.  Lincoln was assassinated before the amendment was ratified by the State of Georgia on December 6, 1865.

While in the Senate, Henderson was chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (Thirty-ninth Congress) and a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs (Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Congresses).  Henderson was not a candidate for reelection to the Senate in 1868 and left the U.S. Senate on March 3, 1869.

Henderson was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Missouri and later U.S. Senator.  In 1875 he was special United States attorney for prosecution of the Whiskey Ring at St. Louis. In 1877 he was appointed a commissioner to treat with hostile tribes of Indians. 

Henderson moved to Washington, D.C. in 1888, was a writer, and resided in the capital until his death in 1913. Interment was in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

Joel Barnett, Baron Barnett, PC (born 14 October 1923), is a Labour member of the House of Lords.  
Barnett was educated at Manchester Central High School. He worked as an accountant. He was elected a councillor on Prestwich Borough Council 1956-1959 and was treasurer of Manchester Fabian Society. 

Barnett stood in Runcorn in 1959 without success.
He was elected Member of Parliament for Heywood and Royton in 1964. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from January 1966.

Barnett served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, from 1974 to 1979 gaining a seat in the cabinet from 1977 onwards and was Dennis Healey's right hand man in the Callaghan Government. During this time he oversaw the devising of what is known as the Barnett Formula by which public spending is apportioned between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.   He has since joked about the strange and unexpected form of immortality that has been accorded to him by 'having his own Formula'.

Having been seen as very much to the right wing of the Callaghan Labour Party he is very much "Left Wing" in the Blair New Labour Party.. the irony being that his politics has remained constant whereas the Party has moved dramatically to the right.   

In 1983 he was made a life peer as Baron Barnett, of Heywood and Royton in Greater Manchester.

(1972) - "Man is so intrinsically related to nature that when he sins against God, nature suffers; and when he obeys God, nature rejoices"

Garrosh Hellscream is the son of Grom Hellscream, the great warchief of the Warsong clan who freed the orcs from their demonic curse by killing the Pit Lord Mannoroth. Garrosh is now an important chief among the Mag'har, the uncorrupted orcs settled in Garadar, a stronghold in Nagrand. He is also aided by Jorin Deadeye, son of the Bleeding Hollow clan's warchief, Killrogg Deadeye. Apparently, Garrosh is now in deep depression because of the illness of Greatmother Geyah, the current leader of the Mag'har, and Warchief Thrall's grandmother. Garrosh is said not to be similar to his father in the spirit... At least not yet. But then again, he didn't drink Mannoroth's Blood, the factor which made his father such a fierce warrior.

The Fernmeldeturm Nürnberg, the tallest structure in Bavaria, is the Nürnberg telecommunication tower, also called the Nuernberger Ei (Egg of Nuremberg) because of its egg-shaped tower basket in 185 metres, is 292 metres high and was built between 1975 and 1977. The tower basket accommodates transmission mechanisms for FM and radio relay link and - unfortunately closed since 1991- a rotating restaurant and a prospect platform. Responsible operator is the DFMG German radio tower GmbH, a subsidiary of  Deutsche Telekom based in Münster. From 22 January 2003 to 4 April 2003 the Nürnberg telecommunication tower also served for the spreading of the program of megaradio on mediumwave frequency 945 kHz. For this a wire antenna was strung along the tower shaft, from the top of the tower to the roof of an operating building near the tower.

Eurostar Italia is a network of Italian inter-city trains, operated by Trenitalia (a major Italian railway company)  on the routes connecting the main Italian cities and towns. Several types of high-speed trains belonging to two major families carry out the service. Trenitalia states that there are 130 train journeys per day.

The first type is the "Pendolino"; this is an EMU (Electric Multiple Unit) built by FIAT Ferroviaria (now Alstom). The first ETR 450 entered service in May 1988 and various versions are now in service such as ETR 460 and ETR 480. All of these trains are capable of speeds up to 250 km/h and are provided with tilting systems that allow fast speeds on old tracks. These Pendolinos are blocked composition trains used on medium traffic routes; they carry up to 480 passengers.



For the main routes Trenitalia uses the ETR 500 trains. These trains can carry 590 or more passengers and are capable of speeds up to 300km/h, although the service is presently limited to 250km/h because of the characteristics of the railway infrastructure. The ETR 500 is an 11-12 carriage train with double symmetrical traction units. This configuration allows the modification of the composition in response to varying service requests. 

Currently, the only lines on which the trains travel at high speed are Florence - Rome - Naples and Novara - Turin. However, currently over 600km of new railway lines are under construction; these new lines will be usable at speeds up to 300km/h. These new lines will alleviate congestion on the existing lines and thus allow better schedules between the major cities. The lines under constructions are Milan - Venice and Milan - Bologna - Florence.

The name Eurostar is used under license from Iveco, which owns the trademark and used the name for one of their trucks. Despite the name similitude, there is no relation between this service and the Eurostar railway service running in the Channel Tunnel.

Service patterns.
As of July 2006, the Eurostar Italia website state they operate the following routes in Italy:

Hourly frequency.
Milan-Bologna-Florence-Rome-Naples;

Bi-hourly frequency.
Turin-Milan-Verona-Venice;
Venice-Bologna-Ancona-Bari;
Venice-Bologna-Florence-Rome;

Put Kids First is a non-profit organization whose goal is to keep kids safe through community involvement, education and legislation.

It is a group that was started by Chris Danielson after the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl from Chris' neighborhood on October 1, 2000. A month later the little girl was found murdered.

Since its beginning, Put Kids First members and volunteers have petitioned for a sex offender registry (in Canada), have attended and organized community events to bring awareness to the issues regarding children's safety, making appearances at offenders' court dates, speaking out and fighting for changes to the law.

Recently Canada's Conservative Government has started motions to change the age of sexual consent from the current 14 years up to 16 years old. Put Kids First supports this action.

<doc id="430735" title="Flint-Worcester Tornadoes" nonfiltered="323" processed="320" dbindex="1500328">


The Flint-Worcester Tornadoes were two tornadoes, one occurring in Flint, Michigan on June 8, 1953, the other in Worcester, Massachusetts on June 9, 1953. These tornadoes are among the deadliest in United States history and were caused by the same storm system that moved east across the nation. The tornadoes are also related together in the public mind because for a brief period it was debated in the U.S. Congress whether recent atomic bomb testing in the upper atmosphere had caused the tornadoes.  Congressman James E. Van Zandt (R-Penn.) was among several Members of Congress who expressed their belief that bomb testing created the tornadoes. They demanded a response from the government. Meteorologists quickly dispelled such an assertion, and Congressman Van Zandt later retracted his statement.

The Flint-Worcester tornadoes were the most infamous storms produced by a larger outbreak of severe weather that began in Iowa and Wisconsin, before moving across the Great Lakes states, and then into New York and New England.  Other F3 and F4 (see Fujita scale) tornadoes struck other locations in Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire and Ohio.



The Flint tornado.


An F5 tornado hit Flint, Michigan on June 8, 1953 .  The tornado moved east-northeast 2 miles north of Flushing, Michigan and devastated the north side of Flint and Beecher. The tornado first descended about 8:30 p.m. on a humid evening near a drive-in movie theater that was flickering to life at twilight time.  Motorists in the drive-in began to flee in panic, creating many auto accidents on nearby roads.  The tornado dissipated near Lapeer, Michigan. Nearly every home was destroyed on both sides of Coldwater Road. Multiple deaths were reported in 20 families. It is, as of this writing, the last single tornado to kill more than 100 people. One hundred and sixteen were killed, making it the ninth deadliest tornado in U.S. history. It is also one of only three F5 tornadoes ever to hit in Michigan. Another F5 would hit in Hudsonville on April 3, 1956.

The Worcester tornado.
The storm system that created the Flint tornado moved east. As radar was relatively primitive in 1953, this led to inadequate severe weather predictions. The Weather Bureau in Buffalo, New York, merely predicted thunderstorms and said that "a tornado may occur." The Weather Bureau in Boston feared that the word "tornado" would strike panic in the public, and refrained from using it. Without warning, an F4 tornado struck central Massachusetts in the late afternoon hours on June 9, 1953.  The tornado descended over the Quabbin Reservoir in Petersham, Massachusetts at 4:25 P.M., witnessed by boaters on the reservoir. It then slammed into the rural towns of Barre and Rutland, followed by suburban Holden, before killing 60 in heavily populated northern Worcester. Ironically, residents of Massachusetts were coming home at that hour of the day to pick up their evening newspapers with front page headlines of the tornado that had struck in Michigan the previous day.  Some wondered if it was the exact same tornado that was now impacting them.  Two visitors from Pittsburgh died when a tree crushed their car. Shrewsbury and Westborough each suffered numerous fatalities. The tornado did its final destruction at the Fayville Post office on Route 9 in Southborough, and dissipated nearby over the Sudbury Reservoir, eighty-four minutes after it formed. Ninety-four people in total were killed.

This tornado was on the ground for nearly an hour and a half. In that period it traveled 46 miles, reached one mile in width and injured 1,300 people. Barre suffered the first 2 fatalities. The tornado then renewed its vigor in Rutland center with 2 more deaths. The funnel widened to 1/2 mile in Holden, where 9 were killed, the worst-hit areas being Winthrop Oaks and Brentwood. 

At 5:08 P.M., the tornado entered Worcester and grew to a width of one mile. Damage was phenomenal in Worcester, which is the second largest city in Massachusetts, and in some areas equalled the worst damage seen in the history of U.S. tornadoes. Hard-hit areas included Assumption College, where a priest and two nuns among the faculty were killed.  The Burncoat Hill and Great Brook Valley neighborhoods were leveled, with houses simply vanishing and debris swept clean from their original sites. A bus was picked up, rolled over several times, and thrown against an apartment building, resulting in the deaths of two passengers.  The Brookside Home Farm, a city-operated dairy facility and laundry, sustained total damage, with six men and most of its 80 Holstein cows killed. Wrecked houses and bodies were blown into Lake Quinsigamond. According to John O'Toole's book (see references), at least one victim definitely perished when suction from the tornado ripped open his chest due to his lungs rapidly expanding. Airborne particles of debris were strewn eastward, reaching an observatory 35 mi (56 km) away, and even out over Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.

This storm maintained a 1-mile width throughout much of Shrewsbury, and was still doing maximum damage when it moved through downtown Westborough, where it began curving towards the northeast in its final leg. Coincidentally, around the time it ended in Southborough at 5:45 P.M., a tornado warning was issued, although by then it was too late.  A separate weaker tornado also descended roughly about the same time in the nearby communities of Franklin and Wrentham in Massachusetts, injuring about 17 persons.  Another tornado did minor damage in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.

The Worcester tornado was a milestone in many regards, not only because of its enormous size and unusual geographic location, but also due to the fact it was the nation's costliest tornado in raw dollars at the time, and its 1300 injuries still stands as the 4th worst in U.S. history. In terms of fatalities, it is the last tornado (as of December 2006) to kill 90 or more people, making it the 20th worst on record. 

The severity of this epic storm remained in dispute for a long period within the meteorological community. Observations classified this tornado as F4 in many communities, but damage was inflicted consistent with an F5 tornado in some locales.  As a result of this debate, the National Weather Service convened a panel of weather experts during the spring of 2005 to study the latest evidence on the wind strength of the Worcester tornado.  The panel considered whether or not to raise the designation of the storm to F5, but finally decided to keep the official rating at F4 during the summer of 2005.  The reasoning for this was that many of the destroyed homes were of recent postwar construction, making them less able to withstand high winds than older homes.

1953 tornado season in perspective.
Even though the 1953 tornado season only saw 422 tornadoes (which is half the nationwide average), the year saw some of the deadliest tornadoes, which included the Waco Tornado that hit on May 11.

How did a tornado hit in Massachusetts?.
Massachusetts is part of the New England tornado alley which extends from central Massachusetts up through Vermont. Massachusetts has had an average of about 2.9 tornadoes yearly since 1950. The New England "Tornado Alley" is most active in July.

Trivia.
The Worcester Tornadoes, an independent league baseball team, are named for the event.

The Furongian (which represented approximately the old notions of Late Cambrian, Merioneth, Croixian, or Potsdamian) is the third and final geological epoch of the Cambrian Period. It spans the time between 501 ± 2 Ma and 488.3 ± 1.7 Ma (million years ago). It has been proposed to divided it three ICS stages, of which only the first (Paibian) is actually defined. Rocks of the Late Cambrian epoch are referred to as Upper Cambrian strata. During the Furongian, trilobites proliferated; they serve as useful index fossils.

Thomas Carleton, (c. 1735   2 February 1817), was born in Ireland to Christoper Carleton and his wife Catherine Ball. He was the younger brother of Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. As part of a military family, Thomas joined the British Army at a young age. In 1753, he was an ensign in the 20th Regiment of Foot and saw action with his regiment during the Seven Years' War. 

In 1776, now a Lt. Col., he arrived in Quebec City to relieve his brother, Gen. Guy Carleton, the Governor General of Canada, who was besieged in the city by the Continental Army forces during the early days of the American Revolutionary War. With the death of Lt. Col. Patrick Gordon on July 25, 1776, Col. Carleton was promoted to command the 29th Regiment of Foot. In 1777, Thomas Carleton's nephew Christopher Carleton joined the 29th regiment. as a major and served under his uncle's command for the rest of the war. Col. Thomas Carleton did not get along very well with his new commander, Frederick Haldimand, who took over for Guy Carleton as Governor General of Canada so Thomas left for England.

In 1784, with his brother's recommendation, Col. Thomas Carleton was appointed as the 1st Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. Here, he helped to re-settle the many Loyalists leaving the United States. Col. Thomas Carleton would serve as Governor of New Brunswick until his death on February 2, 1817, though from 1805 he lived in England. 

Mount Carleton, the tallest mountain in New Brunswick, is named for him.

Pet sitting is a job taking care of a pet in their own home during the absence of their owner.

The professional pet sitting industry is growing rapidly because many pet owners feel there are advantages to using pet sitters instead of other pet care options.  Some of the attractive benefits of using a pet sitter include:

 Possible reduced stress on pets because pets are cared for in their own home;
 No "travel trama" to pets because they do not need to be transported anywhere.  ;
 Exposure to illnesses and parasites of other animals is minimized.  ;
 Required vaccinations are often less restrictive then those necessary at a kennel;
 Pets also stay on their regular routines.  ;
 Pets do not need to adapt to a new environment.
 No inconveniencing neighbors, friends, or family members.  ;

Pet sitting service includes special services for client homes, including watering plants, putting out trash, and other tasks that give a client's home a lived-in look to deter crime while the client is away.

During vacation services a sitter may visit a client home as frequently as four times a day or as infrequently as once every other day depending on the needs of the resident pets and the pet sitter's business policies.  The exact length of visit is determined by both pet owners and pet sitters, but on average pet sitting is 15 to 45 minutes per session.  Visits are generally scheduled in agreed upon time slots.

Pet sitters also provide professional dog walking services.  These services most often used by people who spend long hours at work during the day, and for clients who do not have the time to exercise their pets regularly each day.  Disabled clients and the elderly also often hire pet sitters to exercise and care for their pets when they are unable to do so.

Most professional pet sitters charge by visit.  There may also be an extra charge for multiple pets, long travel times, and some special tasks.

Professional pet sitters are most often licensed as required by their area, and insured for liability including care, custody, and control of the pet(s) within their care.  Many pet sitters are also bonded or insured for theft.  Many pet sitters will have some training, such as pet first aid certification and animal husbandry classes.  There are a number of major online forums, message boards, associations, and training centers that pet sitters frequent in order to learn more about how to grow their businesses and better their services.

Some questions clients may consider while choosing a pet sitter:  

 Do they have availability that fits my needs?
 Are they a member of professional organizations?
 Are they insured, including care, custody, and control of the pet(s) in their care?
 Do they have employees, and are employees bonded or insured for theft?
 Do they have a good reputation with other clients & area pet businesses?
 What kind of experience and qualifications do they have?
 Do they have references?
 Do they have a backup in case of emergencies or personal illness?
 Do they carry a pet first aid kit with them?
 Do they have experience or training in pet first aid?
 Are you comfortable with their payment and refund policies?
 Did they seem comfortable with your pets during the consultation in your home?
 Did they ask many questions and write down detailed care information during the consultation?
 Did you sign a contract for service, as well as a release in case the pet needs emergency vet care?

The above summary was created by members of a pet sitting organization based on pet sitter experience & surveys taken by pet sitters on the Yahoo pet sitting message board AboutPetSitting.

Bacúrov (; ) is a village and municipality of the Zvolen District in the Banská Bystrica Region of Slovakia

History.
The earliest written reference of Bacúrov dates from 1255 when the village was known as Villa Bochorou (Wasseraw in old German). Historical background of Bacúrov reflects the geographical location of the village. Situated near well known historical mining towns of Banská ¦tiavnica, Banská Bystrica and Kremnica, the village was in the spotlight of many historical events. In mid 16th century during Turkish invasions, the local villagers were responsible for road guarding. Tatars were also threatening the existence of the village. In late 16th century, they used to camp just on the outskirts of Bacúrov and Ostrá Lúka.

<doc id="191246" title="New Romantic" nonfiltered="329" processed="326" dbindex="1500335">

New Romantic was a New Wave music genre and fashion movement that occurred primarily in England during the early 1980s. The genre emerged after the London punk scene had come to an end, with former members of the movement splintering into Hardcore punk, the New Romantic, Gothic rock and postpunk movements. The term was coined by Richard James Burgess, producer for the band Spandau Ballet.
Origins.
The genre's genesis took place largely through clubs such as Billy's in Dean Street, London, which ran David Bowie and Roxy Music nights in the aftermath, evolving into the highly successful and elitist Blitz Club in Great Queen Street and later Hell, which were hosted by Steve Strange who was also the doorman and Rusty Egan who was the DJ and in many ways defined the sound of the movement. Boy George was the cloakroom attendant. The club spawned a hundred suburban spin-offs in, around and outside London, among which were Croc's in Rayleigh, Essex, and The Regency in Chadwell Heath, where Depeche Mode and Culture Club had their debut gigs as fledgling bands, the movement rapidly spread as far as Barbarella's Club in Birmingham, while it was still underground, shaping the newly formed Duran Duran.

History.
The New Romantic phenomenon was similar to that of glam rock during the early 1970s, in that (male) New Romantics dressed in effeminate clothing, often with frilly "fop" shirts, and wore cosmetics. David Bowie was an obvious influence and interestingly his 1980 single "Fashion" was influenced by and was simultaneously considered to be something of an anthem for the New Romantics, as were Brian Eno and Roxy Music. However as with many art school-based youth movements, by the time this 'anthem' was pronounced, the movement itself, although successfully projecting many new stylish futuristic ideas and visions (with lots of various references to sci-fi), had been seized upon by commercial forces, and watered-down versions were being cheaply reproduced for the High Street.

Despite the movement's ties to glam rock, the moods and themes explored by the New Romantics differed sharply from those examined by their supposed forefathers - compare Slade's screeching "Coz I Luv You" to Visage's more languorous "Fade to Grey".

The main difference from glam, however, was that instead of guitar rock, the music was largely synthesiser-based electropop music. Japanese electronic-music pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra were a significant influence in this regard, as were German electronic innovators such as Kraftwerk and Can. Major British influences included the futuristic sounds of computer-synthesiser experimenters such as Landscape and Ultravox intelligently introducing plenty of innovative and experimental sounds. Rhythm machines were introduced into wide use by this movement largely due to the experiments of drummers Richard James Burgess (Landscape), Warren Cann (Ultravox) and Rusty Egan (Visage). 

Jim Fouratt of Danceteria, NYC spotted the burgeoning movement in London and was an early champion for what would become the second British invasion. Spandau Ballet visited New York in 1981 for a landmark performance at the Underground. By the mid 1980's the genre had its feet firmly planted in America. On the west coast of California its moniker saw a slight shortening and "New Ro" (pronounced newro) became a trend among teens looking for a synthetic medium between the surf and ska inspired "Mod" category, and the rougher guitar-based Punk scene.

New Romantic bands and artists.
List of New Romantic bands;
The main musical and stylistic proponents of the New Romantic movement were Spandau Ballet, ABC,Visage, Ultravox, Landscape, Adam & The Ants, and Duran Duran especially during the period from mid-1979 to mid-1982. Other bands of the era which were later associated with the New Romantic movement include Japan, Depeche Mode, Simple Minds, Soft Cell, The Human League, Eurythmics, OMD, Tears for Fears, A Flock of Seagulls, Classix Nouveaux and Talk Talk.
In the mid-1990s, New Romantic was briefly revived in England as a movement called Romo in clubs like Club Skinny.  Orlando is generally seen to have been the most successful Romo group.

Ambrogio Borgognone (also known as Ambrogio da Fossano or Ambrogio Stefani da Fossano or as il Bergognone, c. 1470s - 1523/1524) was an Italian Renaissance painter of the Milanese school.

Biography.
While he was nearly contemporary with Leonardo da Vinci, but painted in a style more akin to the pre-Renaissance, Lombard art of Vincenzo Foppa and Bernardino Zenale. The dates of his birth and death are unknown; he is said to have been born at Fossano in Piedmont, and whose appellation was due to his artistic affiliation to the Burgundian school.

His fame is principally associated with his work at the Certosa di Pavia complex, composed of the church and convent of the Carthusians. It is unlikely he designed, in 1473, the celebrated facade of the Certosa itself. He worked there for eight years starting in 1486, when he furnished the designs of the figures of the virgin, saints and apostles for the choir-stalls, executed in tarsia or inlaid wood work by Bartolomeo Pola, till 1494, when he returned to Milan. Only one known picture, an altar-piece at the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, can with probability be assigned to a period of his career earlier than 1486.

For two years after his return to Milan he worked at the church of San Satiro in that city. From 1497 he was engaged for some time in decorating with paintings the church of the Incoronata in the neighboring Lodi. Documentation of him thenceforth is scant. In 1508 he painted for a church in Bergamo; in 1512, his signature appears in a public document of Milan; in 1524 - and this is our last authentic record - he painted a series of frescoes illustrating the life of St. Sisinius in the portico of San Simpliciano at Milan. Borgognone considered a modestly talented painter with marked individuality. He holds an interesting place in the most interesting period of Italian art.

The National Gallery, London, has a number or his works: the separate fragments of a silk banner painted for the Certosa, and containing the heads of two kneeling groups severally of men and women; and a large altar-piece of the marriage of St Catherine, painted for the chapel of Rebecchino near Pavia.

But to judge of his real powers and peculiar ideals, his system of faint and clear coloring, whether in fresco, tempera or oil; his somewhat slender and pallid types, not without something that reminds us of northern art in their Teutonic sentimentality as well as their fidelity of portraiture; the conflict of his instinctive love of placidity and calm with a somewhat forced and borrowed energy in figures where energy is demanded, his conservatism in the matter of storied and minutely diversified backgrounds to judge of these qualities of the master as they are, it is necessary to study first the great series of his frescoes and altar-pieces at the Certosa, and next those remains of later frescoes and altarpieces at Milan and Lodi, in which we find the influence of Leonardo and of the new time mingling with, but not expelling, his first predilections.

Bernardino Luini is said to have been one of his pupils.

<doc id="2152" title="All Quiet on the Western Front" nonfiltered="333" processed="330" dbindex="1500339">


For the film, see All Quiet on the Western Front (film).

All Quiet on the Western Front is a novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I, about the horrors of that war and also the deep detachment from German civilian life felt by many men returning from the front. The book was first published in German as Im Westen nichts Neues in January 1929. It sold 2.5 million copies in twenty-five languages in its first eighteen months in print. In 1930 the book was turned into an Oscar-winning movie of the same name, directed by Lewis Milestone. 

It is often considered the best war book ever written.

Title and translation.
The 1929 English translation by A. W. Wheen gives the title as All Quiet on the Western Front.  The literal translation is in fact "Nothing New in the West", with "West" being the war front, which was in fact a routine dispatch used by the German Army.  This title in German adds to the terrible irony of the actual situation.  In English the phrase would be unclear, whereas "All Quiet..." does sound like the English used for such matters.  

Brian Murdoch's 1994 translation renders the phrase as "there was nothing new to report on the western front" within the narrative.  Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:

Although it does not match the German exactly (there is a different kind of irony in the literal version...), Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.

Separately, the phrase "all quiet on the western front" later became popular slang for a lack of action (in reference to the Phony War in World War II's Western Front).  

Plot summary.

The story follows the experiences of Paul Bäumer: a soldier whose teacher inspires him to join the German army shortly after the start of the war. He arrives on the Western Front with his friends (Tjaden, Müller, Kropp and a number of other characters) and meets Stanislaus Katczinsky, known as Kat. The older Kat soon becomes Paul's mentor and teaches him about the realities of war. Paul and Kat swiftly become almost brothers, bonded by the hardships of the war.

Paul and his friends have to endure day after day of non-stop bombardment. Eventually it all becomes clear to him: war is entirely pointless. All his friends say that they are fighting the war for a few national leaders whom they have never met and most likely never will. They are the only people that can gain anything from this war, not Paul and his friends.

The book focuses not on heroic stories of bravery as do so many other war stories, but rather gives a realistic view of the hell in which the soldiers found themselves. The monotony, the constant artillery fire, the struggle to find food, and the overarching role of chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers, all are described in detail. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally depleted and hardened. "We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces."

Paul receives a period of leave from the army, and returns home temporarily. He finds it difficult to understand people at home anymore. While all the soldiers at the front wish for nothing more than peace, knowing that they are losing the war, civilians back home talk about marching on Paris. He is also indifferent to the significance of any of the battles. Battles have no names. Rather, one after another they offer a chance for him to be killed. Battle seems to be waged only to gain pitifully small pieces of land.  He returns to his school where his teacher is still encouraging young men to enlist.  Asked to what the war is like, he tells them the truth and is shouted out of the classroom.

Main Characters.

Paul Bäumer.

Paul Bäumer is the narrator. He is convinced to enlist in the German Army for WWI by his long-time teacher Kantorek, who promises that Paul will have a sense of satisfaction having done something with himself. 

He's 18 years old when he goes to war.

Erich Remarque uses Paul Bäumer to magnify some of the experiences he viewed himself as a WW I veteran.

He is kind hearted and always willing to lend a hand.

His deeds include: giving his remaining cigarettes to Russian prisoners and replacing the new recruits saw blade bayonets with shovels, catching a goose to cook with Kat in an intimate lean-to, visiting his dying mother with whom he has little relationship, stabbing a French soldier in a shell hole, and spending the night with the dead body.

Along with others of his group, he teaches the basics of war to the new recruits, but in their excitement, they do everything wrong.

In the film adaptations, he was shown killed whilst reaching for a butterfly (film) or bird (television movie).

Paul is also used to describe the highly heightened sense of war, and the remorse when killing the French soldier mentioned above.  He goes through the man's pockets, learns about his life and family and (briefly) dedicates himself to their welfare.

The day on which Paul is finally killed was otherwise militarily uneventful, with the German army dispatches merely noting Im Westen nichts Neues, which, as noted above, translates literally to Nothing new in the West. This brings home that Paul's death - being only one among millions - is nothing special.

Albert Kropp.
Perhaps Paul's closest friend, Kropp was in his class at school, and is described as the smartest of the group. Paul mentions that in the middle of battle, Kropp mutters physics problems to himself. Kropp is wounded near the novel's conclusion, and he has an amputation, but since he was supposed to go home soon after Paul leaves him, it can be assumed that he is the only main character of the story to survive the war. * It is also suggested that Kropp committed suicide after leaving Paul as he had threatened to do if his leg was amputated, which it was.

Tjaden.
A skinny locksmith of Paul's age and the biggest eater of the company, Tjaden did not volunteer for the war. Labeled as a "piss-a-bed", Tjaden received unfair treatment from Corporal Himmelstoss for urinating in his sleep; This system of 're-education' involved hunting up another bedwetter, who was quartered in the same bunk as Tjaden. The man on top would urinate at night, and the fellow below would be switched from bottom the next night so that he could retaliate. He was a very greedy young man who always found time to eat a good hearty meal.

Leer.
A close friend to Paul, Albert and the others, Leer was in their graduating class, and was the first  to have sexual intercourse. He is the most sexually suggestive of all the characters in the story. Leer dies after being shot shortly before the conclusion of the novel. After he bleeds to death, Paul can only remark of Leer, "What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician at school."

Müller.
The most pragmatic of the group, he is most noted for grilling his comrades with questions about what they're going to do after the war, he is the one most trying to hold onto their past. He is also the inheritor of Kemmerich's boots, for which he fervently begs whilst Kemmerich is dying, showing how the war turns a man from an individual into a heap of supplies which they might as well make use of. The boots are later passed on to Paul after Muller's agonizing death.

Haie Westus.
Haie is described as being tall and strong, and Paul identifies him as being slightly older than he, and a peat-digger by profession. Haie also has a good sense of humor. He receives a wound in the back during a battle, large enough for Paul to see his lung when he breathes, and he dies soon after.

Stanislaus Katczinsky.
Also known as Kat.
Of an older age than Paul Baumer and his younger comrades, Katczinsky worked as a cobbler in civilian life. As an elderly figure, Kat serves as a leadership figure for Paul and his friends, as well as a literary model showcasing the differences between the younger and older soldiers, the latter whom Paul describes as being connected to their former life, whereas he and the men his age have their parents, schooling, and a few, a girl. When he is killed, it is as though a great hero has died.

Kat is also well-known for his ability to scrounge nearly any necessary item, above all food. Examples of this are provided throughout the book; for instance, one night Paul and his company of men are quartered in a factory without rations nor comfortable bedding; Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the wire bedding. Later, to cure the hunger of some of his men, Kat retrieves bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt, and a pan in which to cook the food.

He was wounded in the end of the story, just before Paul himself is killed. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover when he arrives at the medics that a shell fragment pierced Kat in the head during the journey, and that he had died. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle (for it can be assumed that Albert Kropp lived above), and it is his death that finally demoralizes Paul to point that he does not care if he dies or not, as he says that he can face the rest of his life without fear, that the coming years "...can take nothing from me. They can take nothing more..." 

Only a few lines of text later, Paul is dead, and he is described as having a look of relief on his face at the moment he passed away.

Minor Characters.

Kantorek.
Kantorek served as Schoolmaster to Paul and his friends, including Haie Westhus, Tjaden, Leer, and Muller. Acting "in a way that cost  nothing," Kantorek is a proponent of the war and convinces Baumer and the rest of his class to join the war effort. Out of twenty enlistees, this includes one Joseph Behm, the first of the class to fall - Ironically, Behm was the only fellow that did not want to fall in line.

Also ironic, Kantorek is later called up as a Territorial, only to be grilled by one of the same students he convinced to enlist.

He was tortured by Mittelstaedt who "copied him to perfection". Mittelstaedt would imitate his snobbiness. 
"Inadequate, Kantorek, quite inadequate."
"Territorial Kantorek, do you call those buttons polished?"
"Look at Boettcher now, there's a model for you to learn from."
"Territorial Kantorek, we have the good fortune to live in a great age, we must embrace ourselves and triumph over hardship."

Bertink.
Lieutenant Bertink, often referred to as The Company Commander, is the leader of Paul's company. His men have a great respect for him. He is shown to carry a great fondness for his men. He lets them eat the extra rations for men that died while the chef argues that they may only eat their share, and is shown as being shocked when so few of his men survive an engagement. Bertink kills a flamethrower team that would have killed all of the protagonists, but is killed by a bullet that richochets and hits and kills Leer as well.

Himmelstoss.
Easily stirring the hatred of the reader, Himmelstoss is a power-hungry corporal with a special dislike of Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of soldiers inferior in rank.   Baumer and his friends mercilessly whip Himmelstoss the night before they board trains to go to the front. After Himmelstoss later joins them on the front, he is a coward who hides and claims that he is wounded because he has a scratch on his face. Paul beats him and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, he joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to Paul after he is wounded. Later he asks for forgiveness from his old students. He was to become the new staff cook. He brings two packets of sugar for Paul and one pound of butter for Tjaden to prove his alliance.

Detering.
He was a farmer who loved his farms. He went mad when he saw a cherry blossom, which reminded him of home too much and urged him to leave. He was found and set before a "field tribunal", but is never heard of again. He was especially fond of horses and was angered at those who used horses in the war.
"It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war."

Josef Hamacher.
Hamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are staying. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a "shooting license," certifing him as sporadically not responsible for his actions, though all evidence points to his being quite sane.

Franz Kemmerich.
A lifelong friend of Baumer and his comrades, Kemmerich is wounded at the beginning of the book.  Later he had his foot amputated, and afterwards died of an infection in his wounds.  He was in possession of some yellow knee-high boots salvaged from a British aircraft pilot.  These are later referred to as "Kemmerich's Boots",  and change hands as Paul and his comrades are killed.

Major themes .

There are many central themes in the book. Among them is that war is total nonsense. For example, none of the characters has ever seen a Frenchman before the war, much less have reason to kill them, but that is now what they are forced to do. Some of the soldiers ponder how the war was started, why it was declared, and whom it benefits. Nobody has any answers.
There are also other themes that include: comradeship/friendship, the humanity of the "enemy", the hypocrisy of authority figures, loss of hope for the future, animal instincts or how war reduces men to animals and many others such as loss of innocence.

The Horror of War.
The main theme of All Quiet on the Western Front is the brutality of war. The archetypical war novel romanticizes war and extolls the heroes of the story, however this book shows a vivid, realistic, and hellish portrait of war. World War I saw the development of many new destructive innovations such as poison gas, machine guns, airplanes and tanks; all of which made killing easier and even more impersonal. The novel shows these weapons being used for butchery on a grand scale; for instance, battles lasting for four months. 

Paul describes the horrors of war throughout the book. The trenches and fortifications are shelled continually, poison gas blankets the battlefield, snipers shoot at anyone with their head above ground. Paul even sees the horrible results from the trench mortars which literally blows men out of their clothes. Finally, the American troops come and the German lines disintegrate. Vivid descriptions are presented throughout the book, combined with gritty little details that could only come from personal experience (Paul explains at one point why a shovel with sharpened edges is so much better in close-up combat than a bayonet.) Nothing short of being there could show the sheer numbers of dead and wounded every day in the war.

Effect On Soldiers.
The physical and mental hardships pressed on soldiers during times of war can be absolutely astounding, and in trench warfare these hardships were ever-present. Bullets, bombs, mortars, and disease easily destroy men by the tens of thousands, while those who live to fight another day are subject to dealing with the mental anguish of the violent deaths of their comrades and the separation from civilian life.

Tying into one of the central themes of the book, Remarque says at the beginning, "This book is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure for those who stand face to face with it. It will simply try to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped the shells, were destroyed by the war."

The book also emphasises that the war was worst for the 'lost generation', those who went straight from school or college into the trenches, as the narrator had done.
The older men still have firm ties to their earlier lives - they have property, wives, children, jobs and interest, and these bonds are all so strong that the war can't break them.  But for us twenty-year-olds there are only our parents, and for some of us a girlfriend.  That isn't much, because at our age parental influence is at its weakest, and the girls haven't really taken over yet.  (Chapter 2);
We are like children who have been abandoned and we are as experienced as old men, we are coarse and superficial - I think we are lost.  (Chapter 6);

 Nature .
The landscape on the front is barren, but when Paul goes on leave, he sees nature. Nature represents escape, it is beautiful and pure. When traveling by train, Paul describes the beautiful mountains and plains of Germany. He wonders why this nature is being destroyed on the front; he wants to preserve this beauty, not destroy it. Also, when he sees the French countryside, he sees it is not different from the German countryside; why should he destroy this either? A disturbing incident involving a group of army horses, terribly wounded in a bombardment and screaming with pain, demonstrates the war's violation of innocent nature.

The author uses nature as a tool to change the tone of his writing to a more reflective and peaceful one, in contrast to the rest of the book.  To temporarily escape from the horrors of war, Paul and his friends swim across a canal late at night for a relaxing evening with several French women who live on the other side. Also, after a particularly violent battle, Paul observes birds flitting tranquilly about the shell-torn fields, and sees two butterflies, miles from any vegetation, perching on the teeth of a skull. He notes that he has seen birds successfully raise their young in the midst of the trenches. This highlights the human absurdity of the war, and also hints at nature's reassuring capacity to go on about its business despite the surrounding turmoil.

Animal Instinct.
In many parts of this book, through Paul Bäumer, Erich Remarque expresses the human spirit transition into a more beastial nature. It is apparent that Erich Remarque believes that the nature of war is so barbaric, that human nature must be lowered to match the level of barbaric war. 

There are many examples of Paul Bäumer reverting to animal instincts. One such time is when he finds himself stuck in a shell hole, surrounded by enemy soldiers. He realizes that if any of the enemy were to join him in the hole, it would mean instant death for him, unless he could act without thinking, and stab instantly. He waits in the hole, hoping that it would not happen. As time goes by, a Frenchman jumps into the shell-hole. Paul stabs the man instinctively --only realizing afterwards that he has killed another human being. Later the barbarity of war leaves his spirit and he experiences guilt, then remorse, and only returns to rationality when he is able to leave the hole and the body within it.

Presence of Death.
Constantly throughout the book, the soldiers are followed by the frightful presence of death. Every time that they go to battle, they pass by their own graves, something that would send chills down any average person's back

Relations to Other Books.
Romeo and Juliet "He buries his face and his limbs in her... She is his only friend, his brother, his mother;... new-won life... he would now be a heap of mangled flesh... that has thrown us to the ground and saved us... there would not be one man alive"(54-55).
This can refer to the famer's soliloquy in Romeo and Juliet:
"The Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her buring grave, that is her womb"(Act IV, Scene III, v 9-10). 
Soldiers fall to the ground for protection--this can be viewed as being reborn, just similarly to a mother's womb protecting her helpless child, continuing the story's Loss Of Innocence theme. A soldier can also drop to the ground after being shot or otherwise killed, thus making the earth his tomb as bodies and dirt pile up on his corpse. 
Homer's Odyssey In All Quiet, hope is presented as a major key to surviving the horrors of war. Homer's epic describes an occasion upon which Odysseus returned home and received a bag. He was instructed not to open it, but during the night one of his crew members did so, thus discovering that hope was the sole remaining item contained within. Remarque also portrayed hope as dangerous, because it allows one to believe, for better or worse, that all will somehow turn out well in the end, regardless of how improbable or impossible such a notion seems.   
 


Film, TV, and Theatrical Adaptations.
 Film .

In 1930, an American film of the novel was made, directed by Lewis Milestone. The screenplay was by Maxwell Anderson, George Abbott, Del Andrews, C. Gardner Sullivan, with uncredited work by Walter Anthony and Milestone. It stars Louis Wolheim, Lew Ayres, John Wray, Arnold Lucy and Ben Alexander.

The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1930 for its producer Carl Laemmle Jr., and an Academy Award for Directing for Lewis Milestone. It was the first all-talking non-musical film to win the Best Picture Oscar. It also received two further nominations: Best Cinematography, for Arthur Edeson, and Best Writing Achievement for Abbott, Anderson and Andrews.

TV film.
In 1979, the film was remade for television by Delbert Mann, starring Richard Thomas of The Waltons as Paul Bäumer.

 The Road Back .


The Road Back, another book written by Erich Maria Remarque, is about a different group of soldiers trying to cope with postwar Germany: dealing with the defeated German society after the war, trying to go to school, and trying to live a normal life.

The book was banned during Nazi rule, the film's content was watered down to avoid a German boycott, and Remarque was stripped of his German citizenship in 1938.

The Abundant Life Church is a large church based in Bradford, England. It is led by Senior Pastor Paul Scanlon, who has written a number of books on the Christian lifestyle. Services each Sunday regularly draw 2,500 attendees.

The church has also opened a second location in Belfast, under the title of "one church, two locations". Abundant Life Church Belfast is led by Pastors Christian and Jelena Allsworth, and has been operating since September 2005.

The four-part mission statement of the church is to "reach the lost, establish the church, equip the saints, and disciple the nations".

History.
The church was formerly a part of Covenant Ministries, but it withdrew from the organisation in 1997. They perceived the church to be of a comfortable and "safe" form of Christianity, and started "crossing over" to a more radical, 21st-century-style church. Although the church greatly grew in numbers following the move, the period in which the change happened was a struggle for those in leadership, as many former core members withdrew their support. In January 2000, the church opened a new 2,500-seater auditorium, now used every Sunday.

Ministries.
The church has an active social outreach programme. Its Community Action Teams (known for short as C.A.T.), headed up by Pastor Matt Stockdale, work with under-privileged families in Bradford. Another outreach division of the church, Mercy Ministries UK, works with women from the red light districts of Bradford.

The church also runs a leadership academy. The academy is led by Associate Pastor Steve Matthew, and students choose from one of two electives - worship, music and creative arts or pastoral leadership. Students take either the one year certificate programme or the two year diploma programme. There are currently around 70 students in the academy. Many of these want to train as pastors, although other Christians take the course for leadership skills.

Rocknations is the youth ministry of the church. It was founded in 1999 by youth pastor Steve Gambill under the name Rock the Nations, later shortened to Rocknations. The ministry has a band named RPM, who play at all youth events as well as some special church events. In early 2005 they released their first album, , which made it to number one in the UK Christian Music Charts in October of that year. A second album, I Surrender All, was recorded in late 2005 and was released in the church shop and on the church website in March 2006, although the general release was not until July 2006.

Wildfire is a the youth group of Bradford's Abundant Life Church led by Wildfire Pastor Tim Staples. Wildfire is the ministry to teens (yrs 7 -9) enjoying great activities like Sk8city, Cheerleading, Street Dancing, Football, Basketball and more followed by Live Bands, Loud Music, and Life empowering messages.

Music.
The Abundant Life Church has produced several worship albums. The music of worship leaders Lara Martin and Mark Stevens, the latter originally from Hillsong Church in Australia, is well-known in the Christian music industry. Pop Idol runner-up Gareth Gates also formerly attended the church and sang on the album Divine Exchange.

Conferences.
Every year the church runs a number of conferences: Build The House (for leaders), Lift (for youth leaders) Devoted (worship and creative arts), Cherish (for women), Rocknations (for young people), Stronger (for the whole church) and Xcel (for men). The conferences are attended by delegates from around the world.  Speakers that have appeared at conferences in the past include Brian Houston, Bobbie Houston, Tommy Barnett, Kevin Gerald, Matthew Barnett, Donna Crouch, Leon Fontaine and Casey Treat.  Visiting bands and artists have included Hillsong United, Delirious?, Natalie Grant, YFriday, Titus, Tree 63 and Electralyte. Switchfoot - the current best-selling Christian band in the world - are due to perform in February 2007. Joyce Meyer preached at the church in November 2006.

Lucia Cammeniti is a fictional character in the Network Ten soap opera Neighbours, portrayed by actress Maria Mercedes. The character made recurring appearances in 2004 and 2005 and returned in 2006.

Character.
The wife of mafia boss Rocco Cammeniti (Robert Forza), Lucia was used to getting her own way, both in her business and personal lives. When Rocco was jailed for his various crimes, Lucia kept control of the family businesses. She then brought her youngest daughter, Carmella (Natalie Blair), back from school in Italy to stand in for her as head editor of All Her magazine.

Carmella s return to Erinsborough saw her reunite with her ex-boyfriend, Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey). As the relationship became more serious, Carmella introduced Connor to Lucia. Although things went reasonably well, Lucia had reservations when she found out that Connor had a baby daughter, Maddy (Madison Lu), from a previous relationship with Lori Lee (Michelle Ang). When Carmella decided to move in with Connor, Lucia secretly made a pact with him to challenge his worth. The first challenge saw him forced to turn $500 into $1000 overnight. When a man named Dan Stevens (Jason Buckley) entered the pub and asked about the secret recipe for O'Neill's Beer, Connor sold him a recipe, albeit a fake one, thus completing his first challenge.

Lucia soon arrived to see Connor and gave him a suitcase. She told him that it contained sensitive information, which could hurt Carmella should she find out, before instructing him to take it to the family s solicitor across town. Unfortunately, a mix-up with recently-blinded Stuart Parker (Blair McDonough) saw the suitcase get mixed up with Stu s work case. As Connor scrambled to stop his friend from opening Lucia s case, he arrived just in time to grab it, but it fell open at his feet. Inside, he found a note from Lucia, saying that she knew that he d open the case. Later that day, as he tried to explain to her exactly what had happened, Lucia told Connor that he d passed with flying colours, as any loving boyfriend would want to find the information inside and prevent his girlfriend from getting hurt. Satisfied with Connor, Lucia left town.

Lucia returned to Ramsay Street after her daughter Rosetta moved into a share house at number 30. She tried to convince Rosetta to move back home and go through with her arranged marriage to wealthy Johnny Brown, who Lucia had selected.

Northern Dancer (May 27, 1961 - November 16,1990) was a Canadian-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and the most successful sire of the 20th Century. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association calls him "one of the most influential sires in Thoroughbred history."

A bay colt, Northern Dancer was by Nearctic-Natalma, by Native Dancer. In 1952, Edward P. Taylor, Canadian business magnate and owner of Windfields Farm, had attended the December sale at Newmarket, England where he purchased Lady Angela, a mare in foal to Nearco. Two years later she was bred again with Nearco, producing a colt named Nearctic who was voted the 1958 Sovereign Award for Horse of the Year. From Nearctic and the mare Natalma, a daughter of the great Native Dancer, came Northern Dancer.

Racing career.
Northern Dancer was ridden by Ron Turcotte in his first victory as a two-year-old at Fort Erie. Before the running of the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky, trainer Horatio Luro asked jockey Bill Shoemaker to make a commitment to ride either Northern Dancer or the more promising colt Hill Rise.  Shoemaker went with the unbeaten Hill Rise, believing the colt represented his best chance for a win at the prestigious Kentucky Derby. As a result of Shoemaker's decision, Bill Hartack became Northern Dancer's permanent jockey, guiding him to his best season in 1964 at age 3 when he won the Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby, Blue Grass Stakes, Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Queen's Plate. He was also named the Eclipse Award champion 3-year-old of 1964.

In his two years of racing, Northern Dancer won 14 of his 18 races and never finished worse than third. In The Blood-Horse ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Northern Dancer was ranked #43.

A sire of champions.
Northern Dancer stood at stud at Taylor's Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario until 1969 when he was moved to Windfields Maryland farm where he remained until his death. Northern Dancer was the most successful sire in thoroughbred horse-racing in the 20th Century. His offspring have earned more money and won more major stakes races than those of any other sire up until the 1990's era of shuttle stallions, including North American, Japanese, Australian and European champions. He sired 146 stakes winners including the great Nijinsky II, winner of England's Triple Crown, as well as The Minstrel, Shareef Dancer, Secreto, El Gran Senor, Fanfreluche and multiple champion sire Sadler's Wells.

An exceptional sire, he was named the 20th century's best sire of sires. Others have given the 'title' to Phalaris, but Phalaris did nothing as a sire when not mated to daughters of Chaucer. In the 1983 Keeneland auction, one of Northern Dancer's colts named Snaafi Dancer became the first $10 million yearling.

Although he has been dead for more than fifteen years, there are more Northern Dancer line Breeder's Cup winners than any other horse.

Honors.
Northern Dancer won the American Eclipse Award as Three-Year Old Male Champion of 1964 and the Sovereign Award for Horse of the Year. In 1965, he became the first horse to ever be voted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, an honour he held for thirty-one years and now shares with Canadian Equestrian Champion Big Ben (inducted 1996). On its formation he was part of the first group of inductees into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1976. He was retired from stud (breeding) on April 15, 1987 at the age of 26. He died in 1990 and is memorialized at Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. In 1999, Canada Post honored the horse with his image placed on a postage stamp. A residential street was named after the horse on the former site of the Greenwood Race Track in east-end Toronto. There is also a life size bronze statue of the horse outside Woodbine Race Track in northwest Toronto.

During the past forty years, a number of books have been written about Northern Dancer with the latest two editions coming out in 2006. One, by respected pedigree authority Avalyn Hunter, author of "American Classic Pedigrees (1914-2002)," recounts how Northern Dancer and his sons have established a royal dynasty that has profoundly dominated the international bloodstock market.

Northern Dancer has his own blog.

<doc id="4681924" title="Helian Bobo" nonfiltered="353" processed="350" dbindex="1500359">


Helian Bobo (    ) (381-425), né Liu Bobo (   ), courtesy name Qujie (  ), formally Emperor Wulie of Xia (    ), was the founding emperor of the Chinese/Xiongnu state Xia.  He is generally considered to be an extremely cruel ruler, one who betrayed every benefactor that he had, and whose thirst for killing was excessive even for the turbulent times that he was in.  He built an impressive capital for his state at Tongwan (  , in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) that remained difficult to siege, even hundreds of years later during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period.  (Confusingly, the Book of Wei refers to him as Helian Qugai (    ), based on a derogatory term that Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei used to refer to him.)

 Early life .

Liu Bobo was born in 381, when his father Liu Weichen (   ) was an important Xiongnu chief and a vassal of Former Qin.  It is not known whether his mother Lady Fu was Liu Weichen's wife or concubine.  He was one of Liu Weichen's younger sons.  After Former Qin collapsed in light of various rebellions after its emperor Fu Ji n's defeat at the Battle of Fei River in 383, Liu Weichen took control of what is now part of Inner Mongolia south of the Yellow River and extreme northern Shaanxi, and while he nominally submitted to both Later Qin and Western Yan as a vassal, he was actually a powerful independent ruler.  However, in 391, he sent his son Liu Zhilidi (    ) to attack Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui, and Tuoba Gui not only defeated Liu Zhilidi, but crossed the Yellow River to attack Liu Weichen's capital Yueba (  , in modern Ordos, Inner Mongolia), capturing it and forcing Liu Weichen and Liu Zhilidi to flee.  The next day, Liu Weichen was killed by his subordinates, and Liu Zhilidi was captured.  Tuoba Gui seized Liu Weichen's territory and people and slaughtered his clan.

However, Liu Bobo escaped and fled to the Xuegan (  ) tribe, whose chief Tai Xifu (   ) refused to turn him over despite Northern Wei demands.  Instead, Tai delivered Liu Bobo to the Xianbei tribal chief Mo Yigan (   ) the Duke of Gaoping, a Later Qin vassal, and Mo Yigan not only gave Liu Bobo refuge but also married one of his daughters to Liu Bobo.  Liu Bobo, from that point on, became highly dependent on his father-in-law.  (Meanwhile, in 393, Tuoba Gui, because of Tai Xifu's refusal to deliver Liu Bobo to him, attacked Tai and slaughtered his people, although Tai himself escaped and fled to Later Qin.)  Little is known about Liu Bobo's life during the following years.  In 402, Tuoba Gui's brother Tuoba Zun (   ) the Prince of Changshan attacked Mo's homebase of Gaoping (  , in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and Mo was forced to flee to Later Qin, abandoning his own people, who were scattered about, although later Later Qin recaptured Gaoping and gave that city back to Mo.

Sometime before 407, Liu Bobo, who had become known for being handsome, ability to speak well, alertness, and intelligence, came to the attention of Later Qin's emperor Yao Xing.  Yao Xing was so impressed by Liu Bobo's abilities when he met Liu Bobo that he wanted to make him a major general to defend against Northern Wei.  Yao Xing's brother Yao Yong (  ), however, spoke against it, believing Liu Bobo to be untrustworthy, stating:

 Liu Bobo is arrogant toward his superiors and elders.  He is cruel to his subordinates and associates.  He is also greedy, treacherous, lacking in love, and inattentive to friendships.  He changes his attitude quickly and abandons things quickly.  If you overly trust and favor this type of person, he will surely create a disaster.;

Yao Xing initially, at Yao Yong's counsel, did not give Liu Bobo a commission, but eventually was so seduced by his talent that he made him a general and the Duke of Wuyuan, giving him the responsibility of defending Shuofang (  , in modern Ordos as well).

In 407, after suffering a number of losses against Northern Wei, Yao Xing decided to make peace with Northern Wei.  Upon hearing this, Liu Bobo became angry, because his father had been killed by Northern Wei, and he planned rebellion.  He therefore forcibly seized the horses that Yujiulü Shelun (     ), the khan of Rouran, had recently offered to Yao Xing as a tribute, and then made a surprise attack on his father-in-law Mo Yigan, capturing Gaoping and killing Mo, seizing his troops.  He then declared himself a descendant of Yu the Great, the founder of Xia Dynasty, and named his state Xia.  He claimed the title "Heavenly Prince" (Tian Wang).

 Early reign .

Despite Liu Bobo's stated hatred for Northern Wei, however, he concentrated his efforts on undermining Later Qin, continually harassing Later Qin's northern territories and draining Later Qin's resources.  He therefore did not settle in a capital city; rather, he roved about with his mobile cavalry, constantly looking for Later Qin cities to pillage.

Also in 407, Liu Bobo sought marriage with a daughter of the Southern Liang prince Tufa Rutan, but Tufa Rutan refused.  In anger, Liu Bobo launched a punitive raid against Southern Liang but then retreated. Tufa Rutan gave chase and, believing that he greatly outpowered Liu Bobo, was careless in his military actions. Liu Bobo led him into a canyon and then blocked the exit with ice and wagons, and then ambushed him -- and the defeat was such that it was said that 60% to 70% of Southern Liang's famed officials and generals died in the battle. Tufa Rutan barely escaped capture.

In 408, Yao Xing sent his general Qi Nan (  ) to launch a major attack on Liu Bobo.  Liu Bobo initially withdraw to let Qi believe that he feared Qi, and Liu Bobo made a surprise counter-attack and captured Qi.  Subsequently, much of Later Qin's northern territories fell into Xia hands.

In 409, Yao Xing himself launched an attack on Liu Bobo, but when he reached Ercheng (  , in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi), he was nearly trapped by Liu Bobo, and escaped only after major casualties.  This defeat forced Yao Xing to cancel a mission, commanded by his general Yao Qiang (  ), to try to save Southern Yan from being destroyed by Jin.  (Without Later Qin aid, Southern Yan fell in 410.)  For the next several years, Xia and Later Qin forces battled constantly, often inconclusively, but with the wars becoming much more costly to Later Qin than Xia, with Southern Liang and Western Qin no longer being willing to be Later Qin vassals as a result.  In 412, when Western Qin's prince Qifu Gangui was assassinated by his nephew Qifu Gongfu (    ), Liu Bobo considered attacking Western Qin despite its status as an ally, but at the counsel of his advisor Wang Maide (   ) did not do so.

By 413, Liu Bobo finally resolved to build a capital -- one that he wanted to make absolutely impenetrable.  He commissioned his cruel general Chigan Ali (    ) as the chief architect of the capital, which he named Tongwan (  , in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) -- because, as he stated, he wanted to unite China and be the lord of 10,000 states.  ("Tong" means "unite," while "wan" means 10,000.)  Chigan ordered that the soil used in constructing the wall be steamed, so that it would be hardened and difficult to attack, and he often tested the walls during its construction; if an iron wedge were able to insert even one inch deep into the wall, the workmen who were in charge of that section of wall would be executed, and their bodies would be stuffed into the wall.  Further, Liu Bobo himself ordered that when weapons and armors are made, that some of the metalsmiths would be executed -- because his orders were, for example, that arrows should be shot at armors; if the arrows could penetrate the armors, the smiths who forged the armors would be executed, and if the arrows could not penetrate the armors, then the smiths who made the arrows would be executed.  As a result of this bloodshed, however, Tongwan became a highly defensible city, and the weapons and armors that he had were all of exceedingly high quality.

Also in 413, Liu Bobo believed that his family name should be changed -- since his ancestors took on the Liu family name from the Han Dynasty imperial house, believing that one of their female ancestors was a Han princess, but Liu Bobo believed this to be improper.  He therefore changed his family name to Helian -- intending it to mean that his might was so great that it would, alas (  hè) be connected (  lián) to the heavens.  He also ordered the nobles to change their family name to Tiefa (  ), intending it to mean that they were as strong as iron (  ti ) and be able to attack (  fá) others.

In 414, Helian Bobo created his wife Lady Liang "Heavenly Princess."  (No further reference to the fate of his wife, Lady Mo, was recorded in history, after he killed her father.)  He created his son Helian Gui (   ) crown prince, and created his other sons dukes.

In 415, Helian Bobo entered into an alliance with Juqu Mengxun, the prince of Northern Liang.

In 416, with Later Qin, now under the rule of Yao Xing's son Yao Hong, under a major attack by the Jin general Liu Yu, Helian Bobo believed that Later Qin would fall to Jin, but that Jin would not be easily able to hold Later Qin's capital region -- Guanzhong.  He therefore intensified his own attacks on Later Qin as well, and preparing to use the opportunity of Later Qin's destruction to seize more territory.  As Later Qin neared destruction, Helian Bobo seized its western territory, centering Anding (  , in modern Pingliang, Gansu), and then prepared for an eventual confrontation with Jin forces, which destroyed Later Qin in 417 and captured its capital Chang'an.

In winter 417, Liu Yu, intent on wanting to seize the Jin throne, left Chang'an under the command of his 11-year-old son Liu Yizhen (   ), and while he left several able generals to assist Liu Yizhen, those generals soon conflicted with each other and were killing each other -- and eventually, LIu Yizhen, believing that the main assistant Liu Yu left him, Wang Xiu (  ), to be about to rebel, had Wang executed.  Meanwhile, Helian Bobo sent his crown prince Helian Gui, another son Helian Chang, and Wang Maide to command armies south, not initially engaging Jin forces but isolating Chang'an from the rest of Jin territory -- a task made easier when Liu Yizhen recalled Jin forces near Chang'an all to Chang'an.  Liu Yu, hearing this, sent his general Zhu Lingshi (   ) to replace Liu Yizhen and recalled Liu Yizhen, but as soon as LIu Yizhen and his troops left Chang'an, they were intercepted and crushed by Xia forces under Helian Gui.  Liu Yizhen barely escaped, but the vast majority of the army was captured.  Helian Bobo stacked the skulls of the Jin dead into a hill-like structure.  Meanwhile, the people of Chang'an, who were angry that Liu Yizhen's forces pillaged the city before leaving, expelled Zhu, allowing Helian Bobo to enter Chang'an easily.  Helian Bobo then claimed the title of emperor.

 Late reign .

Most of Helian Bobo's officials suggested that he move the capital to Chang'an, but he, believing that Tongwan was in a better position to defend against Northern Wei, refused and kept his capital at Tongwan, leaving Helian Gui in charge of Chang'an as viceroy.

The campaign against Jin showcased Helian Bobo's abilities, but at this time, he also grew increasingly cruel.  He was described by traditional historians in this way:

 He was arrogant and cruel, treating the people like wild plants and mustard greens.  He often climbed up towers with bows and arrows, and whenever he had a sudden thought of distrust, dislike, or anger at a person, he would kill that person personally.  If any of his officials looked at him in a gazing manner, he would gouge out their eyes.  Anyone who laughed frivolously would have their lips sliced open with knives.  Anyone who dared to offer a contrary opinion would first have his tongue cut out and then head cut off.;

In 424, for reasons lost to history, Helian Bobo decided to depose Crown Prince Gui and create another son, Helian Lun (   ) the Duke of Jiuquan crown prince.  Upon hearing this news, Helian Gui commanded his troops north from Chang'an and attacked Helian Lun.  Their forces met at Gaoping, and Helian Gui defeated and killed Helian Lun.  However, Helian Lun's brother Helian Chang then made a surprise attack on Helian Gui, killing him and seizing his troops, leading them back to Tongwan.  Helian Bobo was pleased and created Helian Chang crown prince.

In summer 425, Helian Bobo died.  Helian Chang succeeded him.

<doc id="3352973" title="Pederasty in ancient Greece" nonfiltered="369" processed="365" dbindex="1500375">


See also Pederasty for situations other than Ancient Greece;

Greek pederasty, as idealized by the Greeks from Archaic times onward, was a relationship and bond between an adolescent boy and an adult man outside of his immediate family, and was constructed initially as an aristocratic moral and educational institution. As such, it was seen by the Greeks as an essential element in their culture from the time of Homer onwards.

The term derives from the combination of pais (Greek for 'boy') with erast s (Greek for 'lover'; cf. eros). In a wider sense it referred to erotic love between adolescents and adult men. The Greeks considered it normal for any man to be drawn to the beauty of a boy - just as much if not more than to that of a woman. What they disagreed upon was whether and how to express that desire.

Pederasty is closely associated with the customs of athletic and artistic nudity in the gymnasia, delayed marriage for gentlemen, symposia and seclusion of women. It is also integral to Greek military training, and an important factor in the deployment of troops.

Analogous relations between Greek women and adolescent girls have been reported by Plutarch, Xenophon and others. See Lesbian for details.

 History .


Possible beginnings.
The ancient Greeks were the first to describe, study, systematize, and establish pederasty as an institution. The origin of that tradition has been variously explained. One school of thought, articulated by Bernard Sergent, holds that the Greek pederastic model evolved from far older Indo-European rites of passage, which were grounded in a shamanic tradition with roots in the neolithic.

Another explanation, articulated by Anglophone scholars such as William Percy, holds that pederasty was formalized in ancient Crete around 630 BC as a means of population control, together with delayed age of marriage for men of thirty years. 

The earliest Greek texts, specifically the works attributed to the Ionian poet Homer, do not overtly document formal pederastic practices. A number of theories attempt to explain that lack. A largely held view is the Dorian hypothesis first established by K.O. Müller in the 1800s.  According to this theory pederasty was brought in by the Dorian warrior tribes who conquered Greece around 1200 BC.  They settled most of the Peloponnese along with the islands Crete, Thera, and Rhodes.  This forced the Ionian Greeks towards Asia Minor but left important cities in Attica and Euboea. Another explanation is that the epic style excluded discussion of certain topics, among them pederastic relations. Nevertheless, Homer's works hint at homoerotic relationships obliquely, as in the mentions of the myth of Zeus and Ganymede in the Iliad and the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.

Alternative forms.
Pederasty was constructed in various ways. In some areas, such as Boeotia, the man and boy were formally joined together and lived as a couple. In other areas, such as Elis, boys were persuaded by means of gifts, and in a few, such as Ionia, such relations were forbidden altogether. The Spartans however were said to practice chaste pederasty. Where allowed, a free man was usually entitled to fall in love with a boy, proclaim it publicly, and court him as long as the boy in question manifested the traits prerequisite to a pederastic relationship: he had to be kalos (), "handsome" and agathos (), good, brave, just, and modest. The boy was expected to be circumspect and not let himself be easily won. Generally, the role of the lover had many of the characteristics of that of legal guardian, similar to the role of male relatives of the boy.

Poets such as Theognis and Anacreon self-identify as pederasts, each thus presenting a persona embodying his own ideals for the tradition. In the case of Theognis, pederasty is political and pedagogical   the elite male's method of passing on his wisdom and loyalties to his beloved. Anacreon's values are erotic and Dionysiac, which is to say sensual and spiritual, and no less ideal than those of Theognis. Vase iconography of the period is consistent with this interpretation: the gifts offered, and the context of the palaestra speak of pedagogic values, while the repeated inscriptions of "KALOS" idealize the beauty and physical attraction of the er menos (the beloved boy).

Problematics.
Foucault declared that pederasty was "problematized" in Greek culture, that it was "the object of a special   and especially intense   moral preoccupation" focusing on concern with the chastity/moderation of the er menos (the term used for the "beloved" youth). Foucault's conclusions however are now thought to hold true only of Classical Athenian texts, while in Archaic Greece pederasty, rather than being problematized, was variously associated with the highest ideals.

The study of Greek pederasty is complicated by the fact that the pederastic record has been subject to systematic destruction since antiquity. Of all the Greek works dealing principally with love between people of the same sex, none has survived, suggesting to at least one historian that "queer works were deliberately suppressed and destroyed rather than merely lost during the passage of time," though in general only a small percentage of ancient literature has been preserved. Nonetheless, there are some conspicuous exceptions to the general picture such as the Paidik  Mousa of Strato and the Er tes of Pseudo-Lucian.

Evolution and extinction.
Greek pederasty went through a series of changes over the millennium from its entry into the historical record and its final demise as an official institution. In some areas, such as Athens, the construction of the relationship seems to have gone from greater modesty in the early days to a freer physicality and lack of restraint in classical times, followed by a return to a more spiritual form in the early fifth century. Its formal end resembled its beginning, in that it came by official decree   that of emperor Justinian, who also put an end to other institutions that sustained ancient culture, such as Plato's Academy and the Olympic Games.

 Philosophical discourses .
Main article: Philosophy of Greek pederasty;



Socrates, Plato, Aeschines Socraticus, and Xenophon described the inspirational powers of love between men though decrying its physical expression.  Upon the death of Plato the presidency of the Academy passed from lover to lover.  Of the Stoics, Chrysippus, Cleanthes, and Zeno fell in love with young men. The topic of pederasty was the subject of extensive analysis. Some of the principal dilemmas discussed were:

Which form should pederasty take, chaste or erotic?
Is pederasty right or wrong?
Is pederasty better or worse than the love of women?

Socrates, as represented in Plato's writings, appears to have favored chaste pederastic relationships, marked by a balance between desire and self-control. By setting aside the sexual consummation of the relationship, Socrates essentialized the friendship and love between the partners. He pointedly criticized purely physical infatuations, for example by mocking Critias' lust for Euthydemus by comparing his behavior towards the boy to that of "a piglet scratching itself against a rock". That, however, did not prevent him from frequenting the boy brothels, from which he bought and freed his future friend and student, Phaedo, nor from describing his erotic intoxication upon glimpsing the beautiful Charmides' naked body beneath his open tunic.

Socrates' love of Alcibiades, which was more than reciprocated, is held as an example of chaste pederasty. Plutarch and Xenophon, in their descriptions of Spartan pederasty, state that even though it is the beautiful boys who are sought above all others (contrary to the Cretan traditions), nevertheless the pederastic couple remains chaste.

Male relationships were represented in complex ways, some honorable and others dishonorable.  But for the vast majority of ancient historians for a man to have not had a youth for a lover presented a deficiency in character.  Plato, in his early works (the Symposium or in Phaedrus), does not question the principles of pederasty and states, referring to same-sex relationships:

For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning in life than a virtuous lover, or to a lover than a beloved youth.  For the principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honor, nor wealth, nor any motive is able to implant so well as love.  Of what am I speaking?  Of the sense of honor and dishonor, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work  And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonor and emulating one another in honor; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that when fighting at each other s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. ;

Later, however, in his Laws, Plato spoke up against the decadence into which traditional Athenian pederasty was sinking, blamed pederasty for promoting civil strife and driving many to their wits' end, and recommended the prohibition of sexual intercourse with boys, laying out a path whereby this may be accomplished. 

Other writers, often under the guise of "debates" between lovers of boys and lovers of women, have recorded other arguments used for and against pederasty. Some, like the charge that the practice was "unnatural" and not to be found among "the lions and the bears," applied to all relationships between men and youths. Others' charges do not involve traditional pederasty, but practices devised for the sexual satisfaction of the strong at the expense of the weak. Chief among these is denouncement of the castration of captive slave boys. As Lucian has it, "Effrontery and tyrannical violence have gone as far as to mutilate nature with a sacrilegious steel, finding, by ripping from males their very manhood, a way to prolong their use.""Erotes" text at Diotima

 Social aspects .


The erastes-eromenos relationship was fundamental to the Classical Greek social and educational system, had its own complex social-sexual etiquette and was an important social institution among the upper class. Pederastic relationships were dyadic mentorships. These mentorships were sanctioned by the state, as evidenced by laws mandating and controlling such relationships. Likewise, they were consecrated by the religious establishment, as can be seen from the many myths describing such relationships between gods and heroes (Apollo and Hyacinth, Zeus and Ganymede, Heracles and Hylas, Pan and Daphnis) and between one hero and another (Achilles and Patroclus, Orestes and Pylades). (It is interesting to note that the Greeks tried to project a semblance of pederasty (read: propriety) onto these last two pairs, despite a great deal of evidence that the two myths were originally intended to symbolize egalitarian relationships.) In general, the pederasty described in the Greek literary sources is clearly an aristocratic institution.

Historical as well as mythographical materials suggest that pederastic relationships required the consent of the boy's father. In Crete, in order for the suitor to carry out the ritual abduction, the father had to approve him as worthy of the honor. Among the Athenians, as Socrates claims in Xenophon's Symposium, "Nothing what concerns the boy is kept hidden from the father, by a noble lover." This is consistent with the paramount role of the Greek patriarch, who had the right of life and death over his children. It is also consistent with the importance that a son would have had for him. Besides the bond of love between them, a son was the only hope for the survival of a Greek man's name, fortune and glory. In order to protect their sons from inappropriate attempts at seduction, fathers appointed slaves named pedagogues to watch over their sons. However, according to Aeschines, Athenian fathers would pray that their sons would be handsome and attractive, with the full knowledge that they would then invariably attract the attention of men and "be the objects of fights because of erotic passions"

Boys entered into such relationships in their teens, around the same age that Greek girls were given in marriage   also to adult husbands many years their senior. There was a difference between the two types of bonding: boys usually had to be courted and were free to choose their mate. Girls, on the other hand, were used for economic and political advantage, their marriages contracted at the discretion of the father and the suitor.

The function of the relationship seems to have been the introduction of the young man into adult society and adult responsibilites. To that end the mentor was expected to teach the young man or to see to his education, and to give him certain appropriate ceremonial gifts (in Crete, an ox, a suit of armor, and a chalice (from kylix, Greek for wine cup), signifying his empowerment in agriculture, war and religion). The bond between the two participants seems to have been based in part on mutual love and desire   usually sexually expressed   and in part on the political interests of the two families. A great deal of importance was placed on the friendship between the two, as shown by a contemporary proverb, A lover is the best friend a boy will ever have. The relationships were open and public, and became part of the biography of the person. Thus when Spartan historians wrote about a personage they would usually indicate whom it was that he had heard or whom it was that he inspired.

For the youth   and his family   one important advantage of being mentored by an influential older man was an expanded social network. Thus, some considered it desirable to have had many older lovers / mentors in one s younger years, both attesting to one's physical beauty and paving the way for attaining important positions in society. Typically, after their sexual relationship had ended and the young man had married, the older man and his protégé would remain on close terms throughout their life. For those lovers who continued their lovemaking after their beloveds had matured, the Greeks made allowances, saying, You can lift up a bull, if you carried the calf.

Pederasty was the idealized form of an age-structured homoeroticism that, like all social institutions, had other, less idyllic, manifestations, such as prostitution or the use of one s slave boys. However, certain forms were prohibited, such as slaves penetrating freemen, or paying free boys or young men for sex. Free youths who did sell their favors were generally ridiculed and later in life were prohibited from performing certain official functions.

A prosecution by an Athenian politician, Aeschines, in 346 BC, Against Timarchus, is an example of how these regulations were used to political advantage. In his speech, Aeschines argues against further allowing Timarchus, an experienced middle-aged politician, his political rights, on account of his having spent his adolescence as the kept boy of a series of wealthy men. Aeschines won his case, and Timarchus was sentenced to atimia. But Aeschines is careful to acknowledge what seemingly all Athens knows: his own dalliances with beautiful boys, the erotic poems he dedicated to these youths, and the scrapes he has gotten into as a result of his affairs, none of which   he hastens to point out   were mediated by money.

Even when lawful, it was not uncommon for the relationship to fail, as it was said of many boys that they "hated no one as much as the man who had been their lover".  See Death of King Philip II of Macedon Likewise, the Cretans required the boy to declare whether the relationship had been to his liking, thus giving him an opportunity to break it off if any violence had been done to him.

Synergy with sports.
The institution of pederasty was inseparable from that of organized sports. The main venue for men and boys to meet and spend time together, and for the men to educate the boys in the arts of warfare, sports, and philosophy was the gymnasium, which was preeminently the training ground for these disciplines, and one of the principal venues for pederastic relationships. In particular, the practice of exercising nude was held to be of the utmost importance in the cult of beauty and eros which permeated pederastic societies. "The cities which have most to do with gymnastics", is the phrase which Plato uses to describe the states where Greek love flourished.  "Gymnastics" in this instance conveys not only the sense of athletic discipline but also, from the Greek gymnos, "nude", the fact that all these exercises were taken by men and boys who were naked, and thus especially liable to be excited by physical beauty.

The beauty and erotic power of the naked body was highlighted by the custom of oiling one's body for exercise. The provision of oil for such decoration was the greatest expense of a gymnasium, and had to be heavily subsidized by the public coffers or private donors. The practice itself varied over time: in the early days it was said that modesty prevented the boys from drawing attention to their sexuality by oiling themselves below the waist. Such restraint was presumably cast by the wayside by Plato's time.

The relationship between a trainer and his athletes often had an erotic dimension, and the same place which served as training ground served equally for erotic dalliances, as can be seen from the many scenes of seduction and lovemaking depicting implements found at palaestras, such as sponges and strigils.

 Educational and military aspects .


Ancient writers, as well as modern historians such as Bruce Thornton, hold that the goal of paiderastia was pedagogical, the channeling of Eros into the creation of noble and good citizens. The various mythographical materials available suggest religious training (see story of Tantalus, Poseidon, and Pelops) as well as military training (Hercules and Hylas). The theme of learning to drive a war chariot occurs repeatedly (Poseidon and Pelops, Laius and Chrysippus). Apollo is said to have taught Orpheus, one of his beloveds, to play the harp. And Zeus had Ganymede serve nectar, a theme with religious connotations. It is thus plausible to assume that even as the loves of the gods paralleled and symbolized those of the mortals, their pedagogy pointed to aspects of the educational process that took place between a lover and his beloved.

In talking about the Cretan rite, the historian Ephorus informs us that the man (known as philetor, befriender) took the boy (known as kleinos, "glorious") into the wilderness, where they spent several months hunting and feasting with their friends. If the boy was satisfied with the conduct of his would-be comrade, he changed his title from kleinos to parastates (comrade and bystander in the ranks of battle and life), returned to the philetor and lived in close bonds of public intimacy with him. Ephorus' account does not discuss the educational aspects of the sojourn. However, this is clearly a coming-of-age rite culminating in a major ceremony upon the return of the pair from the mountains, and a process of acculturation into male society is implied. (See  for Athenian practices and philosophy)

 Military function .
Military training is inseparable from the other educational aspects of pederasty since the times of the Ancient Greeks were marked by continuous warfare, both internal and external. Martial prowess was held in the highest esteem, and one of the principal functions of pederastic relationships was the cultivation of bravery and fighting skills.



 Sexual aspects .
Ancient sources suggest a range of sexual activity. Cicero, describing Spartan customs, suggests that relations were expected to stop short of consummation, "The Lacedaemonians, while they permit all things except outrage  in the love of youths, certainly distinguish the forbidden by a thin wall of partition from the sanctioned, for they allow embraces and a common couch to lovers." On the other hand, one Athenian term for sodomy was "to do it the Lacedemonian way." Literary sources are a lot more risqué, especially ancient comedy. For example, Aristophanes, in 'Peace', his parody of Ganymede riding on the back of Zeus in eagle form, has his character ride to Olympus on the back of a dung beetle, a scatological pun on anal sex. Some modern historians, such as Thornton, conclude that whether the relationship was consummated or not probably depended on the partners.

The majority of ceramic paintings depict the older partner importuning the younger, in a variation of the Greek gesture for pleading. Normally the supplicant embraced the knees of the person whose favor he sought, while grasping the man's chin so as to look into his eyes. Pederastic art usually shows the man standing, grasping the boy's chin with one hand and reaching to fondle his genitals with the other. The boys are shown in varying degrees of rejecting or accepting the man's attentions. Less frequently, intercrural intercourse is depicted, where the erastes is shown inserting his penis between the thighs of the younger one. Only very rarely is anal sex suggested or shown. A number of sources suggest it was seen as shameful. Among these is a fable attributed to Aesop which tells that Aeschyne (Shame) consented to enter the human body from behind only as long as Eros did not follow the same path, and would fly away right off if he did. Other literary and epigraphic indications, such as the Theran grafitti suggest it was more common.

All this was claimed to be endured by the youth without physical excitement. K. J. Dover states that the eromenos was not "supposed" to feel desire for the erastes, as that would be unmanly. More recent evidence suggests that in actual practice (as opposed to theory) there was, in fact, reciprocation of desire. As Thomas Hubbard points out in a critique of David Halperin's contention that boys were not aroused, some vases do show boys as being sexually responsive, and "Fondling a boy's organ (cf. Aristophanes, Birds 142) was one of the most commonly represented courtship gestures on the vases. What can the point of this act have been unless lovers in fact derived some pleasure from feeling and watching the boy's developing organ wake up and respond to their manual stimulation?" 

The theme of mutuality of desire was a topic of discussion in ancient times as well. While the passive role was seen as problematic, to be attracted to men was often taken
as a sign of masculinity, and it was thought that the boys who most sought the company and affections of men were the most likely to be successful in life.

 Religious aspects .


Myths provide more than fifty examples of young men who were the lovers of gods. Poets and traditions ascribe Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Orpheus, Hercules, Dionysus, Hermes, and Pan to such love.  All the main gods of the pantheon except Ares had these relationships.

Mythographic material suggests that the initiate experienced ecstatic states of spirit journey leading to mystic death and transfiguration, analogous to practices still reported today in shamanic work. If so, by the fifth century the Greeks had forgotten the connection. In 476 BC, the poet Pindar, in his Olympian Ode I, claims to be horrified by suggestions that the gods would eat human flesh   in this context, an obvious shamanic metaphor. An opposite theory (discussed by Murray in his Homosexualities) gives credence to the texts that credit (or blame) the Cretans with its origination (Aristotle et al.) and notes the anomaly of an apparent path of diffusion radiating from Crete, while the areas (in the north of Greece) closest to the Indo-European sources are not known to have institutionalized the practice.

Myths also were a vehicle for conveying a set of moral standards for such relationship. In the myth of Zeus and Ganymede, when Zeus sends gifts and assurances to Tros, king of Troy and father of Ganymede, the ancients were reminded that even the king of Heaven must show consideration to the father of the eromenos. Many of the other pederastic myths likewise incorporate the presence of the father, suggesting an essential role for the father in these relationships. The myths also spoke directly to the youths, as is shown by a recently discovered version of the Narcissus myth. This, a more archaic version than the one related by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, is a moral tale in which the proud and unfeeling Narcissus is punished by the gods for having spurned all his male suitors.

 Political aspects .
The state benefitted from these relationships, according to the statements of ancient writers. The friendship functioned as a restraint on the youth, since if he committed a crime it was not he but his lover who was punished. In the military the lovers fought side by side, with each vying to shine before the other. Thus, it was said that an army of lovers would be invincible, as was the case until the battle of Chaeronea with the Theban Sacred Band, a battalion of one hundred and fifty warriors pairs, each lover fighting beside his beloved.

Pederastic couples were also said to be fundamental to democracy and feared by tyrants, because the bond between the friends was stronger than that of obedience to a tyrannical ruler. Athenaeus states that "Hieronymus the Aristotelian says that love with boys was fashionable because several tyrannies had been overturned by young men in their prime, joined together as comrades in mutual sympathy." He gives as examples of such pederastic couples the Athenians Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who were credited (perhaps symbolically) with the overthrow of the tyrant Hippias and the establishment of the democracy, and also Chariton and Melanippus. Others, such as Aristotle, claimed that some states encouraged pederasty as a means of population control, by directing love and sexual desire into non-procreative channels, a feature of pederasty also employed by other cultures.

Political leaders Solon, Peisistratus, Hippias, Hipparchus, Themistocles, Aristides, Critias, Demosthenes, and Aeschines of Athens; Pausanias, Lysander, and Agesilaus of Sparta; Polycrates of Samos; Hieron and Agathocles of Syracuse; Epaminondas and Pelopidas of Thebes; and Archelaus, Philip II, and Alexander of Macedon were recorded to have had same-sex relationships.

Regional characteristics.

The structure of pederastic practices varied from one polis to another, differences that often became the basis of competition or denigration between the cities. For example, the character of Pausanias in Plato's Symposium unfavorably compares regions such as Elis and Boeotia, where men are "unskilled in speech" and boys are permitted to yield uncritically, or Ionia, where boys are forbidden to yield, to the superior pederasty of Athens and Sparta, where men are well versed in the art of rhetoric and boys relate critically to their suitors, choosing only the most persuasive.

Athens .

The founder of the pederastic tradition in Athens is said to be the lawgiver Solon, who also composed poetry praising the love of boys. The lover was known as the erastes, and his young partner as the eromenos or paidika.. High society generally encouraged the erastes to pursue a boy to love. At the same time, the boy and his family were expected to be selective and not yield too easily. 

Pederastic affairs were the butt of jokes for the commoners. Athenian philosophers, around the end of the fifth century, prompted by a discomfort with the lack of self-restraint and crude sexuality of some pederastic relationships, elaborated a philosophy of pederasty that valorized chaste pederastic relations.

Chalkis.
Chalkis was also known in Greece as one of the centers of pederasty, leading the Athenians to jocularly use the verb chalkidizein for "sodomize". In talking about the origin of the Ganymede myth, Athenaeus claims that "the Chalcidians assert that  Ganymede was carried off by Zeus in their own country, and they point out the place, calling it Harpagion." Initially the Chalcidians were said to have frowned on pederasty. However, being in military straits in a war against the Eretrians, they called for the aid of a warrior named Cleomachus.  Cleomachus brought his eromenos along. In sight of the boy he displayed great bravery, leading the Chalcidian charge against the Eretians, bringing victory to the Chalcidians at the cost of his own life. The Chalcidians erected a tomb for him in their marketplace and from that time on began to honor pederasty.  Aristotle attributed a popular local song to the event:
Ye lads of grace and sprung from worthy stock
Grudge not to bravemen converse with your beauty
In cities of Chalcis, Love, looser of limbs
Thrives side by side with courage.

Crete.


The Cretans, a Dorian people described by Plutarch as renowned for their moderation and conservative ways, practiced an archaic form of pederasty in which the man enacted a ritual kidnapping of a boy of his choosing, with the consent of the boy's father. 

Aristotle states that it was king Minos who established pederasty as a means of population control on the island community. This custom was highly regarded, and it was considered shameful for a youth to not acquire a male lover. These same Cretans were credited with introducing the myth of Zeus kidnapping Ganymede to be his lover in Olympus   though even the king of the gods had to make amends to the father.

Ionia and Aeolia.
Most of the early pederastic elegiac poets, with the exception of Theognis and Tyrtaeus, were of Aeolian and Ionian descent. Unlike the warlike mainland Greeks, these were sailors and merchants. They seem to have transformed the compulsory Doric pederasty of martial apprenticeship into an elective, intellectual undertaking, and indulged in it extensively.

Their tradition featured poets such as Anacreon, and Alcaeus, a man also reputed for his bravery and political skills, who composed many of the sympotic skolia that were to become later part of the mainland tradition. Unlike the Dorians, where a lover would usually have only on eromenos, in the east a man might have several eromenoi over the course of his life. From the poems of Alcaeus we learn that the lover would customarily invite his eromenos to dine with him.   However, once Ionia was annexed by the Persians, the practice was outlawed. This was regarded as reflecting moral weakness. On one hand it revealed the rulers' greed for power - thus their suppression of customs likely to lead to strong friendships and inquisitive minds, the product of love. On the other, it revealed the cowardice of the subjects.

Megara.
One of the first cities after Sparta to be associated with the custom of athletic nudity, Megara was home to the runner Orsippus who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the Olympic games and "first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked."

Megara was also the home of the poet Theognis, among whose works are many pederastic compositions, often addressed to his beloved Cyrnus. In his work he associates naked athletics with pederasty: Happy is the lover who works out naked
And then goes home to sleep all day with a beautiful boy.
Many critics hold that his is not the work of a single poet but represents "several generations of wisdom poetry."  The poems are "social, political, or ethical precepts transmitted to Cyrnus as part of his formation into an adult Megarian aristocrat in Theognis' own image."

It has been noted that in the seventh century, when pederasty is postulated to have first been formalized in Dorian cities, Megara cultivated good relations with Sparta, and may have been culturally attracted to emulate Spartan practices.

Another poet, Theocritus, describes a local kissing contest for boys:
    And ye Megarians, at Nesaea dwelling,
   Expert at rowing, mariners excelling,
    Be happy ever! for with honors due
    Th' Athenian Diocles, to friendship true
    Ye celebrate. With the first blush of spring
    The youth surround his tomb: there who shall bring
    The sweetest kiss. whose lip is Purest found,

    Back to his mother goes with garlands crowned.
    Nice touch the arbiter must have indeed,
    And must, methinks, the blue-eyed Ganymede
    Invoke with many prayers a mouth to own
    True to the touch of lips, as Lydian stone
    To proof of gold which test will instant show
    The pure or base, as money changers know. 

Sparta.

Sparta, another Dorian polis, is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and one of the first to formalize pederasty. The Spartans believed that the love of an older, accomplished aristocrat for an adolescent was essential to his formation as a free citizen. The agoge, the education of the ruling class, was thus founded on pederastic relationships required of each citizen.

Many ancient writers held that Spartan pederasty was chaste, though still erotic. Plutarch also describes the relationships as chaste, and states that it was as unthinkable for a lover to sexually consummate a relationship with his beloved as for a father to do so with his own son. Aelian goes even farther, stating that if any couple succumbed to temptation and indulged in carnal relations, they would have to redeem the affront to the honor of Sparta by either going into exile or taking their own lives.

The lover was responsible for the boy's training. Pederasty and military training were intimately connected in Sparta, as in many other cities. The Spartans, claims Athenaeus  sacrificed to Eros before every battle.

Thebes.


In Thebes, the main polis in Boeotia, renowned for its practice of pederasty, the tradition was enshrined in the founding myth of the city. In this instance the story was meant to teach by counterexample: it depicts Laius, one of the mythical ancestors of the Thebans, in the role of a lover who betrays the father and rapes the son. Another Boeotian pederastic myth is the story of Narcissus.

Theban pederasty, was instituted as an educational device for boys, in order to "soften, while they were young, their natural fierceness", and to "temper the manners and characters of the youth".   The Sacred Band of Thebes, a battalion made up of 150 pairs of lovers, was unbeatable until its final battle against Phillip II at Chaeronea in 338 BC.

Influence on literature and the arts.


Poets write of pederasty from the earliest eras to the end of the Hellenistic era.  Five philosophical dialogues debate its ethical implications.  Notable scholars and writers such as Plato, Xenophon, Plutarch, and pseudo-Lucian would discuss the topic.  Tragedies on the theme became very popular. Aristophanes made comical theater about sexual relationships between men and youths. 

The famous poets Alcaeus, Ibycus, Anacreon, Theognis, Pindar and of course Sappho all wrote of pederastic love.  Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides made plays on the subject.

Vases portray numerous homoerotic depictions with hundreds of inscriptions celebrating the love of youths.  Famous politicians, warriors, artists, and writers would enjoy these relationships.  Such idealized relationships held an honored place in their culture from at least 600 BC to 400 AD. (Dialogues)

The sculptor Phidias even memorialized his lover Pantarces in marble by inscribing his name on the finger of a colossal statue of Zeus.  During the Hellenistic era (332 BC   400 AD) Plutarch, Athenaeus, and Aelian traced the history of Greek homosexuality to its beginning.

 Ceremonies and proverbs .
 Oath of loyalty at the tomb of Iolaus in Thebes; rite undertaken by lovers to consecrate the relationship. ;

 The Iolaeia, a yearly athletic festival in Thebes, consisting of musical, gymnastic and equestrian events (agones). It was held in the gymnasium of Iolaus in honor of Heracles, and lasted several days. The winners were awarded brass tripods.;

 The Hyacinthia festival in Sparta, honoring Hyacinth, the mythical young prince of Sparta and beloved of Apollo. The festivities continued for three days, with the first mourning the death of Hyacinthus and the last two celebrating his rebirth. It has been suggested that the cycle symbolizes the development of a youth in such relationships, in which he dies as a child in order to be reborn as an adult.

 Gymnopaedia; Spartan dances by naked boys, attendance restricted to married men.

 The Diocleia festival at Megara in honour of Diocles, lover of Philolaus; A kissing contest was held in which the boys would kiss a male judge, with a wreath awarded to the one with the best kiss. ;

A lover is the best friend a boy will ever have. ;

You can carry a bull, if you carried the calf. Also in Ancient Rome, as Taurum tollet, qui vitulum sustulerit. Said to excuse men's relations with "boys" who were no longer adolescents.;

 Modern scholarship .

The ethical views held in those societies (such as Athens, Thebes, Crete, Sparta, Elis, and others) on the practice of pederasty have been explored by scholars only since the end of the nineteenth century. One of the first to do so was John Addington Symonds, who wrote his seminal work A Problem in Greek Ethics in 1873, but had to wait twenty eight years to be able to publish it (in revised form) in 1901 . Edward Carpenter expanded the scope of the study, with his 1914 work, Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk. The text examines homoerotic practices of all types, not only pederastic ones, and ranges over cultures spanning the whole globe. In Germany the work was continued by classicist Paul Brand writing under the pseudonym Hans Licht, who published his Sexual Life in Ancient Greece in 1932.

Mainstream Ancient Greek studies however had historically omitted references of the widespread practice of homosexuality. In 1910 a book called Maurice by E. M. Forster made reference to this "code of silence" by having a Cambridge professor employing  Omit: a reference to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks.  Four decades later in the 1940s:  This aspect of Greek morals is an extraordinary one, into which, for the sake of our equanimity, it is unprofitable to pry too closely , by H. Michell. It would not be until 1978 when an English book on this topic, titled Greek Homosexuality, was published by K. J. Dover.

Dover's work triggered a number of debates which still continue. At the most basic level, there is strong resistance among modern Greeks to the portrait of ancient Greece painted by modern scholarship   that of a culture which integrated and valorized some aspects of same sex love for a period lasting close to one thousand years. See discussion of controversy

A modern line of thought leading from Dover to Foucault to Halperin holds that the eromenos did not reciprocate the love and desire of the erastes, and that the relationship was factored on a sexual domination of the younger by the older, a politics of penetration held to be true of all adult male Athenians' relations with their social inferiors   boys, women and slaves   a theory propounded also by Eva Keuls. From this perspective, the relationships are charcterized and factored on a power differential between the participants, and as essentially asymmetrical. 

Other scholars point to artwork on vases, poetry and philosophical works such as the Platonic discussion of anteros, "love returned," all of which show tenderness and desire and love on the part of the eromenos matching and responding to that of the ersates. Critics of Dover and his followers also point out that they ignore all material which argued against their "overly theoretical" interpretation of a human and emotional relationship and counter that "Clearly, a mutual, consensual bond was formed," and that it is "a modern fairy tale that the younger eromenos was never aroused."

Halperin's position has been criticized as a "persistently negative and judgmental rhetoric implying exploitation and domination as the fundamental characteristics of pre-modern sexual models" and challenged as a polemic of "mainstream assimilationist gay apologists" and an attempt to "demonize and purge from the movement" all non-orthodox male sexualities, especially that involving adults and adolescents.

The Cassar-Torreggiani family was one of the most powerful families of the 19th and early 20th centuries whom rose from peasants to intermarring with the Maltese nobility.
Antonio Cassar Torreggiani (1882-1959) received his education at St Ignatius' College, St Julians, before starting on a short period in the Royal Malta Army. During Wold War I he also served as a member of the food control board.

For many years Cassar Torreggiani was head of the Cassar Company Ltd which owned the St Georges's Flour Mills at Marsa. These premises were bombed and repaired no less than seven times during World War II.

Cassar Torreggiani was also prominent as a banker, serving on the boards of the Banco di Malta and the Anglo-Maltese Bank. When,on the night of 29 April 1941, the premises of both banks were bombed, he housed them for seven months in his own private office in Kingsway, Valletta. In January 1946 these two banks were amalgamated into the National Bank of Malta, and he became the new bank's first chairman.

Cassar Torreggiani was a philantropist with a great heart. In Zejtun, he joined forces with Bishop Galea to set up the Istituto Nazareno per gli Orfani. In the annals of Maltese sport he is remembered as the creator of one of Malta's most prestigious football competition, the Cassar Cup, proceeds from which were annually directed to local charities. Close to Lm 50,000 were donated during its first thirty years.

Between 1924-26 Cassar Torreggiani was elected as one of the two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in the Senate. He is recorded as having made contacts with the Argentine Minister of Agriculture in that period regarding facilities for Maltese migrants to that country.

He was also very prominent and active in the Chamber of Commerce. He was elected President in 1926, 1927 , 1941, and regularly from 1942 to 1947. In 1948 he was elected honorary President for Life.

He was survived by his two sons and his two daughters., dying 1978.
The family occupied much of the industrial companies in Malta that brought wealth and many donations to churches, the poor and their employees. They intermarried with much of the rising names of the 19th century, such as Cali, Caruana Dingli, and then into much of the nobility.

<doc id="1597853" title="Xanadu House" nonfiltered="376" processed="372" dbindex="1500383">



The Xanadu Houses were a series of experimental homes, built to showcase examples of computers and automation in the home in the United States. The architectural project began in 1979, and during the early 1980s three houses were built in different parts of the United States: one each in Kissimmee, Florida; Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin; and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The houses included novel construction and design techniques, and became popular tourist attractions during the 1980s.

The Xanadu Houses were notable for being built with polyurethane insulation foam rather than concrete, for easy, fast, and cost-effective construction. They were ergonomically designed, and contained some of the earliest home automation systems. The Kissimmee Xanadu, designed by Roy Mason, was the most popular, and at its peak was attracting 1000 visitors every day. The Wisconsin Dells and Gatlinburg houses were closed and demolished in the early 1990s; the Kissimmee Xanadu House was closed in 1996 and demolished in October 2005.

History.    


Bob Masters, who conceived the Xanadu House concept, was an early pioneer in creating and living in houses built of rigid insulation. Before creating Xanadu House, Masters designed and created inflatable balloons to be used in the construction of the house. He was inspired by the Kesinger House in Denver, by architect Stan Nord Connolly, one of the earliest homes built from insulation. Masters built his first home in 1969 in two-and-a-half days during a blustery snowstorm, using the same methods later used to build the Xanadu houses. Masters was convinced that these dome-shaped homes built of foam could work for others, so he decided to create a series of show homes around the country. Masters s business partner Tom Gussel chose the name "Xanadu" for the homes, a reference to Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan s summer residence Xanadu, which is prominently featured in Samuel Taylor Coleridge s famous poem Kubla Khan. "Xanadu" is also the name of the palace in the movie Citizen Kane.

The first Xanadu House was located in Wisconsin Dells. It was designed by architect Stewart Gordon in 1979, and was created by Bob Masters. It was 4,000 square feet in area, and featured a geodesic greenhouse. In its first summer, 100,000 people visited the new attraction.

The most popular Xanadu house was the second house, designed by architect Roy Mason. Masters had met Mason at a futures conference in Toronto in 1980. Mason had worked on a similar project prior to his involvement in the creation of the Kissimmee Xanadu House   an  experimental school  on a hill in Virginia which was also a foam structure. Both Mason and Masters were influenced by other experimental houses and building concepts which emphasized ergonomics, usability, and energy efficiency. These included apartments designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa featuring detachable building modules and more significant designs including a floating habitat made of fiberglass designed by Jacques Beufs for living on water surfaces, concepts for living underwater by architect Jacques Rougerie and the Don Metz house built in the 1970s which took advantage of the earth as insulation. Fifty years before Xanadu House, another "House of Tomorrow" at the Century Progress Exposition in Chicago introduced air conditioning, forced air heating, circuit breakers, electric eye doors, and other innovative features.

Mason believed Xanadu House would alter people's views of houses as little more than inanimate, passive shelters against the elements. "No one's really looked at the house as a total organic system," said Mason, who was also the architecture editor of The Futurist magazine. "The house can have intelligence and each room can have intelligence." The estimated cost of construction for one home was $300,000. Roy Mason also planned a low cost version which would cost $80,000, to show that homes using computers do not have to be expensive. The low cost Xanadu was never built.

Disney opened the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow in Florida on October 1 1982 as the EPCOT Center. Masters and Mason decided to open a Xanadu House several miles away in Kissimmee. It eventually opened in 1983, after several years of research into the concepts Xanadu would use. It was over 6,000 square feet in size, considerably larger than the average house because it was built as a showcase. At its peak in the mid 1980s, more than 1,000 people were visiting the new Kissimmee attraction every day. A third Xanadu House was built in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Shortly after the Xanadu Houses were built and opened as visitor attractions, tourism companies began to advertise them as the "home of the future" in brochures encouraging people to visit.

By the early 1990s, the Xanadu houses began to lose popularity because the technology they used was quickly becoming obsolete, and as a result the houses in Wisconsin and Tennessee were demolished, while the Xanadu House in Kissimmee continued to operate as a public visitor attraction until it was closed in 1996. It was consequently put up for sale in 1997 and was sold for office and storage use. By 2001 the Kissimmee house had suffered greatly from mold and mildew throughout the interior due to a lack of maintenance since being used as a visitor attraction, it was put up for sale again for an asking price of US$2 million. By October 2005, the last of the Xanadu houses had been demolished, following years of abandonment and use by the homeless. A condominium is planned for the Xanadu tract.

Design.
Xanadu House was ergonomically designed, with future occupants in mind. It used curved walls, painted concrete floors rather than carpets, a light color scheme featuring cool colors throughout, and an open-floor plan linking rooms together without the use of doors. The modular exterior was reminiscent of a UFO, because of the domes built by spraying polyurethane foam onto removable molds. Xanadu House featured white painted walls, a communications pole, an outside public toilet, and a lake. It had at least two entrances, and large porthole-type windows. The interior of Xanadu was cave-like, featuring cramped rooms and low ceilings. The interior used a cream color for the walls, and a pale green for the floor. At the center of the house was the living room, in which a large false tree supported the roof, and also acted as part of the built-in heating system.

Construction of the Xanadu house in Kissimmee, Florida, began with the pouring of a concrete slab base and the erection of a tension ring 40 feet in diameter to anchor the domed roof of what would become the "Great Room" of the house. A pre-shaped vinyl balloon was formed and attached to the ring, and then inflated by air pressure from large fans. Once the form was fully inflated, its interior surface was sprayed with quick-hardening polyurethane plastic foam. Spraying from the inside permitted work to continue even in wet or windy weather. The foam, produced by the sudden mixture of two chemicals that expand on contact to 30 times their original volume, hardened almost instantly. Repeated spraying produced a five-to-six-inch-thick structurally sound shell within a few hours. Once the foam cured, the plastic balloon form was removed to be used again. Once the second dome was completed and the balloon form removed, the two rooms were joined together by wire mesh which was also sprayed with foam to form a connecting gallery or hall. This process was repeated until the house was complete. Window, skylight, and door openings were cut and the frames foamed into place. Finally, the interior of the entire structure was sprayed with a 3/4 inch coating of fireproof material that also provided a smooth, easy-to-clean finish for walls and ceilings. The exterior was given a coat of white elastomeric paint as the final touch.

Interior.
The Xanadu Houses used an automated system controlled by Commodore microcomputers. The houses had 15 rooms each, of these the kitchen, party room, health spa, and bedrooms all used computers and other electronics equipment heavily in their design. For example, the bath could be filled with water at a set temperature on a specific date and time. The automation concepts which Xanadu House used are based on original ideas conceived in the 1950s and earlier. The Xanadu Houses aimed to bring the original concepts into a finished and working implementation. As visitors followed an electronic tour guide of the house, featuring constantly changing computer-graphics art shows on video screens in the family room, they learned about the different advantages and features of the Xanadu House including the security and fire systems.

 
 


The main features of the Xanadu House design included an "electronic hearth" featuring a television, games console, sound system, VCR and other electronics equipment, an automated kitchen including tele-shopping and housekeeping capabilities, a family room with several television sets to watch multiple channels at once, a telecommunications antenna, computer-controlled heating and computer-controlled electricity and gas usage.

Xanadu House's kitchen was automated by "autochef", an electronic dietitian which planned well-balanced meals. Meals could be cooked automatically at a set date and time. If new food was required, it could either be obtained via tele-shopping through the computer system or from Xanadu's own greenhouse. The kitchen's computer terminal could also be used for the household calendar, records, and home book keeping.

The Xanadu homes also suggested a way to do business at home with the office room and the use of computers for electronic mail, access to stock and commodities trading, and news services.

Computers in the master bedroom allowed for other parts of the house to be controlled. This eliminated chores such as having to go downstairs to turn off the coffee pot after one had gone to bed. The children's bedroom featured the latest in teaching microcomputers and "videotexture" windows, whose realistic computer-generated landscapes could shift in a flash from scenes of real places anywhere in the world to imaginary scenes. The beds at the right of the room retreated into the wall to save space and cut down on clutter; the study niches were just the right size for curling up all alone with a pocket computer game or a book.

The "great room" was the largest room in the entire Xanadu home, and included a fountain, small television set, and a video projector. Nearby was the dining room, featuring a glass table with a curved seat surrounding it; behind the seats was a large window covering the entire wall. The family room featured television monitors and other electronic equipment covering the walls. The builders called the entertainment center an "electronic hearth". It was planned as a gathering place for family members and relatives, just as is a traditional hearth with a fireplace.

In the spa, people could relax in a whirlpool, sun sauna, and environmentally-controlled habitat, and even exercise with the help of spa monitors. One of the advantages of using computers in the home includes security. In Xanadu House, a HAL-type voice would speak when someone entered to make the intruder think someone was home.

Disadvantages.
An initial concern was that the cost of electricity would be excessive, since several computers would be running all day, all year. However, Mason figured that a central computer could control the energy consumption of all the other computers in the house. Many believed using computers in the home was a disadvantage, because if the computer failed, occupants would be restricted from getting food, having a bath, and even leaving the house if doors are locked. Many also resisted the concept of computers in the home because of concerns people would become less social. Those in favor argued that computers improved security and helped get household chores such as cleaning done quickly.

While the majority of people who visited a Xanadu House felt at ease because of the organic design, others felt that the concept was not viable because it was badly affected by the weather. Other architects and designers saw Xanadu House as an unprofessional architectural design because of the materials used, and the odd use of colors and shapes inside the home. Designers continued to build conventionally-shaped homes, dismissing Xanadu House as an unsuccessful concept. Many disliked Xanadu House as a practical home because of its low ceilings, curved walls, and cramped rooms.

Xanadu in print.


A book about Xanadu House entitled Xanadu: The Computerized Home of Tomorrow and How It Can Be Yours Today! and written by Roy Mason, Lane Jennings and Robert Evans was published by Acropolis Books in November 1983. The book explains how computers can be used in the home, including many concepts in use today such as integrated media centers, televisions and sound systems; it also describes how the Xanadu Houses were designed and constructed, including interviews with Bob Masters. The book includes several photos of the Xanadu Houses, and discusses several other similar examples of architecture that used rigid insulation or an automated computer system.

Trivia.
 The episode title is a slight change of the premiere episode's title, Something Wicca This Way Comes, which in itself is a pun of Something Wicked This Way Comes.
 Seemingly the last episode of the series, but a late renewal from The WB resulted in a season eight during the autumn of 2005.
 An alternative ending was written by Brad Kern, he pitched both the alternate ending and the ending that aired on the episode to the writers and cast. They all agreed that the alternate ending wasn't a good one because it involved the deaths of the Charmed Ones, leading it to close after seven seasons.
 Zankou states that they cannot use their powers to uncover the Nexus for it is neither good nor evil and will see them as a threat. However, when Phoebe was possessed by the Shadow of the Nexus in Is There A Woogy In The House?, she turned evil due to the fact that the Nexus was persuaded to evil (or it tapped into her dark side).
 In this episode Phoebe and Piper are discussing ideas to vanquish Zankou, in their conversation they mention events from the past. These include: The confidence spell Piper casted on one of the guys working at Quake. The switching body spell Phoebe had cast on herself. The love spell casted by Phoebe and Piper to make men fall for them. And the spell that turned everyone at P3 into an animal in the episode. Piper also mentions that they could turn Phoebe into a Banshee so she can kill Zankou.
 This is the last time the Nexus is ever mentioned or referred to in the Charmed series.
 The Cleaners, magical beings who cover up magic used in front of mortals, did not appear in this episode. Yet they should've, since their job is to keep magic a secret from humans and magic was exposed in this episode.
 When the book was stolen from the sisters in the episode Witch Trial they used the first spell in order to call it back. Even if they couldn't do it again from afar because Zankou protected the book, it seems logical that this is the spell they need to get it back.
 Leo explains that Prue taught him how to astral project before she died. This could definitely be so, given the fact that she had already developed the ability as a second power in the second season, and died at the end of the third season. However, the episode "Witch Way Now?" also suggest that it's implied Prue taught Leo the astral projection spell which he in turn taught to the sisters, allowing them to temporarily replicate the power.
 Zankou thinks he is the first demon to see Magic School but actually in the episode Styx Feet Under a demon had previously entered the school. Also on season eight, it is revealed that there are Noxon demons hidden in the dungeon. Leo trapped them there to be used for the advanced combat classes.
 Paige, as a half Whitelighter, has been shown to glamour without the use of a spoken spell, which falls into true Charmed continuity. However, in this episode Piper and Phoebe also possess this ability even though they are not part Whitelighter and previously had to speak a spell to do so. However, the episode "Hyde School Reunion" suggests there is a spell to temporarily grant a witch the power to glamour which is never heard or used on screen. Also in the season two episode "Morality Bites" there was a spell in the book to glamour ones' self.
 There is an appearance by vampires that are led by a new Vampire Queen. This probably implies that there are different vampire covens. But, it was explained in the season four episode Bite Me, that vampires are immune to witches powers, yet Piper is able to kill vampire bats with her powers, which could mean that this is a weaker coven or Piper's powers have grown in the last three years to be able to vanquish novice vampires.
 The 'Power of Three' spell allows the Charmed Ones to get their confidence back and allowed them to touch the Book of Shadows.
Zankou takes Phoebe and Piper's power in this episode to gain access to the Book Of Shadows.
 When the sisters attempt to destroy the nexus Zankou flames into the room and throws them into a wall in the basement. When the camera first shows Phoebe she has on open toed sandals. When they get up Phoebe has on tennis shoes.
 Paige is able to use her powers in astral form, when Prue was never able to before her death. However, Prue was known to have been learning how to use her powers in astral mode. This would probably be the lesson that Phoebe was referring to when she said that Prue was protective of the astral projection spell.
 This is the last episode that Darryl Morris is in.

<doc id="2501903" title="Ten-bell salute" nonfiltered="381" processed="377" dbindex="1500388">
In professional wrestling, a ten-bell salute is given to honor a wrestler that has died, especially when that wrestler is a current member of the promotion or a distinguished former member of the promotion.

It is typically given at the beginning of a card, with the current members of the promotion either in the entranceway, in the ring or around the ring.  Both wrestlers and audience observe a moment of silence during the tolling of the bell.

Honorees.
World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment.
In World Wrestling Entertainment (and its predecessor, the World Wrestling Federation), several such salutes have been televised over the past ten years. Some of the honorees have included:

 André the Giant (1993, heart failure).
 Brian Pillman (1997, heart failure).
 Owen Hart (1999, ring accident).
 Gorilla Monsoon (1999, heart failure).
 "The British Bulldog" Davey Boy Smith (2002, heart attack).
 Lord Alfred Hayes (2005, complications from a stroke).
 Eddie Guerrero (2005, heart failure).

A ten-bell salute was also given at WWF events following the September 11, 2001 attacks, to honor those who were killed.

Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.
The most remembered instance of this honor in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling is the salute given to Chris Candido at TNA Hard Justice in May 2005.  He had died of a blood clot, a complication of leg surgery, on April 28 of that year.

Extreme Championship Wrestling.
In ECW, at their Cyber Slam 1998 event, the Ten-bell salute was given in rememberance of Louie Spicolli who died from an accidental drugs overdose on February 15, 1998.

In boxing.
The ten-bell salute is also used in boxing to honor a departed boxer, where it is known as the "fi
