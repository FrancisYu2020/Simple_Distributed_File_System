<doc id="79195" title="History of Sumer" nonfiltered="1" processed="1" dbindex="450000">

The history of Sumer, taken to include the prehistoric Ubaid and Uruk periods, spans the 5th to 3rd millennia BC, ending with the downfall of the Third Dynasty of Ur around 2004 BC, followed by a transition period of Amorite states before the rise of Babylonia in the 18th century BC.

The Sumerians claimed that their civilisation had been brought, fully formed, to the city of Eridu (possibly from Dilmun, later identified with Bahrain) by their god Enki or by his advisor or Abgallu (from Ab=water, Gal=great, Lu=man), Adapa U-an (the Oannes of Berossus).  This claim may be in part based upon fact, as Eridu was then on the coastline of the Persian Gulf, and was the oldest city of southern Mesopotamia.

The list of Sumerian kings contains a traditional list of the early dynasties; however much of it is likely mythical, and only a few of the early names have been authenticated through archaeology. The best-known dynasty, that of Lagash, is not listed there at all.

Earliest city-states.
It is difficult to identify what, other than the development of irrigation, may have inspired urban settlement. The centres of Eridu and Uruk, two of the earliest cities, had successively elaborated large temple complexes built of mudbrick. Developing as small shrines with the earliest settlements, by the Early Dynastic I period, they had become the most imposing structures in their respective cities, each dedicated to its own respective god.  From south to north, the principal ones were

 Eridu - Abzu Temple - Enki;
 Ur -  E-Nunmah Temple - Nanna (moon);
 Uruk - Eanna Temple - Inanna;
 Lagash - E-Ninnu temple - Ningirsu;
 Nippur - Ekur Temple - Enlil;
 Shuruppak - ? - Ninlil (wife of Enlil);
 Marad- ? - Ninurta;
 Kish - ? - Ninhursag;
 Sippar - ? - Utu (sun);
 ? - E-Kishnugal - Dumuzi;

Historians until recently agreed that before 3000 BC the political life of the city was headed by a priest-king (ensi) and based around these temples, but some more recent authors have asserted that the cities had secular rulers from the earliest times. The development of a sophisticated system of administration led to the invention of writing of numbers about 3500 BC, pictographic writing about 3100 BC, and syllabic writing about 2600 BC.

Early Dynastic period.



Archaeologists divide the Early History of Sumer into three periods - 

 Early Dynastic I (dated to the period before ca. 3000 BC);
 Early Dynastic II (ca. 3000 - 2560 BC);
 Early Dynastic III (ca. 2560 - 2320 BC);

No inscriptions have yet been found verifying any names of kings that can be associated with the Early Dynastic I period.  The Sumerian king list portrays the passage of power over time from the south to the north of the country, before finishing with a description of a universal flood.  Archaeologists have confirmed the presence of a widespread layer of riverine silt deposits, shortly after the Priora oscillation, interrupting the sequence of settlement, centred on the city of Shuruppak, and extending as far as Kish. 

1st Dynasty of Kish.


Inscriptions have been found bearing some Early Dynastic II names from the King List.  After the flood, Kingship is said to have resumed at Kish, under the reign of a king Etana. This first name on the list accompanied by any additional detail is that of Etana, whom it calls "the shepherd, who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries".  He was estimated by Roux to have lived approximately 3000 BC.  Of the 11 kings that followed over a period assumed to have been about 350 years, a number of Semitic Akkadian names are recorded, suggesting that these people made up a sizable proportion of the population of this northern city. The first monarch on the list whose historical existence has been independently attested through archaeological finds is Enmebaragesi of Kish (ca. 2700 BC), 22nd king of that dynasty, said to have conquered Elam and built the temple of Enlil in Nippur.  
His successor, Agga, is said to have fought with Gilgamesh of Uruk, the 5th king of that city.  From this time, for a period Uruk seems to have had some kind of hegemony in Sumer.  This illustrates a weakness of the Sumerian kinglist, as contemporaries are often placed in successive dynasties, making reconstruction difficult.

1st Dynasty of Uruk.

Meshkiagkashar is listed as the first King of Uruk.  He was followed by Enmerkar, claimed by David Rohl as having been Nimrod the Hunter, mentioned in the Bible as founding Erech.  The epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta tells of his voyage by river to Aratta, often considered an early form of the name Urartu, but believed by some Iranian archaeologists to have been a reference to the newly-discovered Jiroft civilization although it cannot be reached by river from Sumer.  Amongst the kings of Uruk who followed are Dumuzi the Shepherd, who also appears in mythology as the husband and consort of Inanna of Uruk, goddess of that city.  He was followed by a Lugalbanda.

The most famous monarch of this Dynasty was Gilgamesh, hero of the Epic of Gilgamesh, copies of which have been found in Hattusas in Anatolia, Megiddo in Israel and Tell el Amarna in Egypt.

1st Dynasty of Ur. 

Meskalamdug is the first recorded King (Lugal from Lu=man, Gal=Great) of the city of Ur.  Another king named on the list, Mesannepada of Ur, seems through archaeological evidence to have succeeded his grandfather, Meskalamdug, and father, Akalamdug.  Mesannepada is recognised as the first king of Early Dynastic III phase, defeating Lugalkildu of Uruk (ca .2560 BC) and Mesilim of Kish, founder of the short-lived 2nd Dynasty of that city. Mesannepada thereafter assumed the title "King of Kish" for himself, a title that seems to have been used by most kings of the preeminent dynasties for some time afterward.

En-hegal, is recorded as the first known ruler of Lagash, being tributary to Uruk.  His successor Lugal-Shag-Egur was similarly tributary to the first Dynasty of Ur.  Mesalim, founder of the 2nd Dynasty of Kish, achieved some kind of independence of these Dynasties.  Mesilim was also mentioned in some of the earliest monuments from Lagash that claim he arbitrated a border dispute between Lugal-shag-engur, high priest of Lagash, and the high priest of their traditional rival, the neighbouring town of Umma.

The Sumerian records also show Nin-Kasalsi, as the first ruler of the city of Adab, at about this time.  Like the later "King" of the 3rd Dynasty of Kish, Nin-Kasalsi was a woman.  Shortly thereafter Sumerian records begin for a dynasty of rulers of the city of Mari, far to the north.

Dynasty of Lagash.
Ur-Nina.
At about 2494 BC, Ur-Nina (also called Ur Nanshe), the new high priest of Lagash, achieved independence from A-annepadda, son of Mesannepada of Ur, and made himself king, founding a dynasty. He succeeded Lugal-Shag-Ekur as high priest. In the ruins of a building attached by him to the temple of Nina, terra cotta bas reliefs of the king and his sons have been found, as well as lions' heads in onyx reminiscent of Egyptian work and onyx plates. These were "booty" dedicated to the goddess Bau. One inscription states that ships of Dilmun (Bahrain) brought him wood as tribute from foreign lands.  He was succeeded by his son Akurgal in about 2465 BC.

Eannatum.



Eannatum, grandson of Ur-Nina, made himself master of the whole of the district of Sumer, together with the cities of Uruk (ruled by Enshakushanna, of the King List), Ur, Nippur, Akshak, and Larsa. He also annexed the kingdom of Kish; however, it recovered its independence after his death. Umma was made tributary - a certain amount of grain being levied upon each person in it, that had to be paid into the treasury of the goddess Nina and the god Ingurisa.

The so-called "Stele of the Vultures," now in the Louvre, was erected as a monument of the victory of Eannatum of Lagash over Enakalle of Umma. On this, various incidents in the war are represented. In one scene, the king stands in his chariot with a curved weapon in his right hand, formed of three bars of metal bound together by rings, while his kilted followers, with helmets on their heads and lances in their hands, march behind him. 

Eannatum's campaigns extended beyond the confines of Sumer. He overran a part of Elam, took the city of Az on the Persian Gulf, and exacted tribute as far as Mari; however many of the realms he conquered were often in revolt. During his reign, temples and palaces were repaired or erected at Lagash and elsewhere; the town of Nina --that probably gave its name to the later Niniveh-- was rebuilt, and canals and reservoirs were excavated.

En-anna-tum.
He was succeeded by his brother, En-anna-tum I. During his rule,  Umma once more asserted independence under Ur-Lumma, who attacked Lagash unsuccessfully.  Ur-Lumma was replaced by a priest-king, Illi, who also attacked Lagash.  Akshak too achieved independence with a line of rulers extending from Puzur-Nirah (2420-2400), Ishu-Il (2400-2360) and Shu-Sin (c2360), son of Ishu-Il, before being defeated by the rulers of Kish.

Entemena.
His son and successor Entemena (ca 2455-2425 BC) restored the prestige of Lagash. Illi of Umma was subdued, with the help of his ally Lugal-kinishe-dudu of Uruk, successor to Enshakushanna and also on the king-list.  This Lugal-kinishe-dudu seems to have been the predominant figure at the time, since he also claimed to rule Kish and Ur.

A tripod of silver dedicated by Entemena to his god is now in the Louvre. A frieze of lions devouring ibexes and deer, incised with great artistic skill, runs round the neck, while the eagle crest of Lagash adorns the globular part. The vase is a proof of the high degree of excellence to which the goldsmith's art had already attained. A vase of calcite, also dedicated by Entemena, has been found at Nippur.

After Entemena, a series of weak, corrupt priest-kings is attested for Lagash. The last of these, Urukagina, was known for his judicial, social, and economic reforms, and his may well be the first legal code known to history.

Empire of Lugal-anne-mundu of Adab.
Following this period, the region of Mesopotamia seems to have come under the sway of a Sumerian conqueror from Adab, Lugal-anne-mundu (ca. 2400-2330 BC), ruling in Uruk, Ur and Lagash.  According to inscriptions, he ruled from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and up to the Zagros Mountains, including Elam. However, his empire fell apart with his death.

His power may have been limited, however, as his reign seems to have been  contemporaneous with the Third Dynasty of Kish, inaugurated by Ku-bau or Ku-baba (ca .2400-2360 BC), unique in the fact that she was the only woman ever to reign as "king".  Before overthrowing the rule of En-shukash-anna of the 2nd Uruk Dynasty and becoming monarch, the king-list says she was a tavern-keeper.  In later centuries she was worshipped as a minor goddess, achieving important status in the Hurrian and Hittite periods, when she was identified with the Hurrian goddess Hannahannah.  In the post-Hittite Phrygian period she was called Kubele (Latin Cybele), Great Mother of the Gods.

Empire of Lugal-zage-si of Umma.
Urukagina was overthrown and his city Lagash captured by Lugal-Zage-Si, the high priest of Umma. Lugal-zage-si also took Uruk and Ur, and made Uruk his capital. In a long inscription that he caused to be engraved on hundreds of stone vases dedicated to En-lil of Nippur, he boasts that his kingdom extended "from the Lower Sea (Persian Gulf), along the Tigris and Euphrates, to the Upper Sea" or Mediterranean.  His empire was finally overthrown by Sargon of Akkad, who founded the first Semitic Empire.

Akkadian Empire.


Gutian period.

Following the fall of Sargon's Empire to the Gutians, a brief "dark ages" ensued; however, one prominent Sumerian ruler of this time was Gudea of Lagash.

"Sumerian Renaissance" (3rd Dynasty of Ur).


The Gutians were finally driven out by the Sumerians under Utu-hegal of Uruk   who was in turn defeated by Ur-Nammu of Ur, who founded what is known as the 3rd dynasty of Ur.  Although the Sumerian language ("Emegir") was again made official, Sumerian identity was already in decline, as the population became continually more and more Semiticised.  

After this 'Ur-III' dynasty was destroyed by the Elamites in 2004 BC, a fierce rivalry developed between the city-states of Larsa, more under Elamite than Sumerian influence, and Isin, that was more Amorite (as the Semitic speakers had come to be called).  The Semites ended up prevailing in Mesopotamia by the time of Hammurabi of Babylon, who founded the Babylonian Empire, and the language and name of Sumer gradually passed into the realm of antiquarian scholars (although their influence on Babylonia and all subsequent cultures was indeed great).  A few historians assert that some Sumerians managed to preserve their identity in a sense, by forming the Magi, or hereditary priestly caste, noted among the later Medes.

Archaeologically, the fall of the Ur III dynasty corresponds to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age.

Reiko Ike (    - Ike Reiko) born May 25 1953 in Tokyo, Japan, is a Japanese actress, singer, and entertainer.  She is best known for her roles in the genre of action/erotic movies known as "pink films."  Ike also released an album of songs in 1971, Kôkotsu No Sekai.  After a drug-related arrest, and another arrest for illegal gambling in the 1970s, Ike dropped out of the entertainment business.
Life and career.
Ike's career was launched with the fourth entry in Toei's Hot Springs Geisha series, Hot Springs Mimizu Geisha (1971). A media frenzy erupted following the release of this film when Ike claimed to have lied about her age to gain a part in the movie. Claiming to have in fact been sixteen years of age when she starred in this softcore sex film, Ike caused a scandal. The publicity only served to make the film one of Toei's most profitable films of the 1970s. 

In her third film, director Norifumi Suzuki's Modern Porno Tale: Inherited Sex Mania (1971), Ike co-starred with French erotic actress, Sandra Julien. Eirin, the Japanese film-rating board, objected to the graphic lesbian scenes between the two actresses, and this film had to be severely cut before it could be released theatrically. Ike decided to stop performing in nude scenes after this film, concentrating instead on films in the delinquent girl sub-genre of S&M films.  Ike starred in five of of Toei's seven Sukeban (girl delinquent boss) films made between 1971 and 1974. Patrick Macias describes this series as, "bare-chested, shotgun-packing chicks Miki Sugimoto and Ike Reiko getting into one catfight after another."  She also starred in all four of Toei's Terror Female High School films made in 1972 and 1973. Ike's later films would include appearances in Kinji Fukasaku's Battles Without Honor and Humanity series and Graveyard of Honor, and the second sequel to Sonny Chiba's The Street Fighter.

Yuko Mihara Weisser calls Ike one of the "icons of Pinky Violence," and in a review of Sex and Fury (1973), DVDManiacs.net called Ike, "the very epitome  the cinematic bad girl, playing her role with a sense of collected cool and tough attitude that can rival that of even better known North American tough gals such as Tura Satana from Faster Pussycat  Kill! Kill! or Pam Grier in Foxy Brown."

<doc id="556305" title="Konx om Pax" nonfiltered="4" processed="4" dbindex="450003">


'Konx Om Pax: Essays in Light is a publication by British occultist Aleister Crowley, first published in 1907.  The name Konx Om Pax is a phrase purportedly used in the Eleusinian Mysteries. Its companion is Khabs Am Pekht, which in the Egyptian language means roughly "Light in extension" or "Light rushing out in a single ray", used pointedly in the Golden Dawn Vernal and Autumnal Equinox ceremonies.

 Contents .
 Introduction .

A barrage of syncretic materials introduce the work:

 the Arabic for Sura 112, al-Ikhlas, from the Qur'an;
 Ave: in John Dee and Edward Kelley's Enochian language;
 the Egyptian hieroglyphs for the Stele of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu;

Three full pages of quotations introduce this work, signaling the syncretic intention of the author.  Many sacred texts and sources such as Dante, Catullus, and Jesus are quoted.

 Dedication and Counter-Dedication .

The Dedication and Counter-Dedication are perhaps the features of this work that will best interest the casual reader who is not a student of Crowley or ancient languages.

 The Wake World .

The Wake World is a disturbingly simple allegory and should inspire any Zelator, and is appropriately called 'a Tale for Babes and Sucklings.' It mocks bad early biologists that ruined the human race ("German" biochemistry) by at one point mentioning roast babies stuffed with sausage and olives. It is also a love story, and should make sinners lament.

 Ali Sloper and the Forty Liars, or a Christmas Diversion .

After Dedication and Counter-Dedication and The Wake World (Liber XCV) - Class C
there is: Ali Sloper, 'containing an essay on AMTh' (Hebrew for "truth"). It is a play format philosophical essay, and the characters take on an important role in this format. There is even a Mr. "W"... as a character called Bones, and as the Walker family owned the Coca Cola Corporation in the 1800's and that corporation was responsible for the red and white bearded modern day image of Santa, which it started in the 30's, it is indeed an important book.

 Thien Tao (Liber XLI) .

Crowley described this as a "Political Essay- Class C".  It purports to retell a Japanese legend of some sort; it veers off characteristically into something more or less grotesque by apparently (?!) attempting to palm off Victorian morality onto Crowley's idea of the Other? It has much to do with the Knights of Malta, and their role in the destruction of bad masonic lodges. This is meant to relate to the thing in Asian organized crime called the Red Dragon, which is like a bad lodge that needs to be shut down.

 Stone of the Philosophers Which is Hidden in the Mountain of Abiegnus .

This discusses the philosopher's stone; it contains La Gintana, a love poem. 

Study of this book is recommended chiefly to serious students of Crowley's thought. Others may find it difficult and obscure.

Alan Hawkshaw is a composer and performer, particularly of themes for movies and television programmes. He is also the father of dance artist Kirsty Hawkshaw.

In the 1960s, he was a member of rock and roll group Emile Ford and the Checkmates. He also formed the Mohawks band with some session musicians. In the 1970s, he played in The Shadows; he worked for Olivia Newton-John as a musical director, arranger and pianist; and he was a keyboard player for Cliff Richard. He composed all the music for the Mysterious World series by Arthur C. Clarke. Hawkshaw also composed 'Best Endeavours', which has been the theme for Channel 4 News since its inception in 1982, and 'Chicken Man', which was the theme for Grange Hill from its start in 1978 until 1990. The Countdown "Chimes" jingle used on Channel 4's Countdown game show was also composed by Hawkshaw.

In the United States, he also scored a number 1 single on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with "Here Comes That Sound Again" as part of Love De-Luxe With Hawkshaw's Discophonia in 1979.

 The Mohawks .

The Mohawks were a band formed from session musicians and fronted by the undisputed king of Library music composers, Alan Hawkshaw. Possibly The Mohawks were never actually a 'touring' band, but rather it was just a clever idea of some guy at KPM music in the 60's who decided to release a LP of incredibly groovy and funky library music tracks and package it under the name "The Champ".

<doc id="8054572" title="King Harry Ferry" nonfiltered="6" processed="6" dbindex="450005">

The King Harry Ferry is a vehicular chain ferry which crosses the Carrick Roads reach of the estuary of the River Fal in the United Kingdom county of Cornwall. The ferry crosses between the villages of Feock and Philleigh, roughly half way between the city of Truro, the lowest bridging point on the estuary, and the town of Falmouth, at the estuary's mouth. The ferry is owned and operated by the King Harry Steam Ferry Company Ltd. The current ferry boat, named No. 7, was built in 2006 and can carry up to 34 cars.

It is likely that there has been a ferry of some description at the King Harry Passage for centuries, but there are conflicting stories about the origins of the name. One such story is that King Henry VIII spent his honeymoon with Anne Boleyn at St Mawes, and signed a charter for the ferry on this site. A more likely origin lies in the fact that a small chapel formerly stood on the Philleigh side of the passage. All that remains of this today is a small pile of stones, but is mentioned in 1528 as "The Chapel of St. Mary and King Henry", commemorating King Henry VI, murdered in 1471. 

The King Harry Steam Ferry was initiated in 1888 as a submerged chain ferry, using a steam engine to pull the ferry along the chains, and replacing a manually propelled barge that was previously used on the route. As its name suggests, the current ferry is the seventh vessel to be used since 1888. Although the owning company has retained the words Steam Ferry in its name, all ferries since 1956 have used diesel-electric propulsion. The company is now owned by a syndicate of five local families. 

The crossing of the River Fal has been voted one of the ten most scenic ferry trips in the world by The Independent, alongside the Staten Island Ferry in New York and the Star Ferry in Hong Kong. The Feock terminal of the ferry is adjacent to the renowned Trelissick Gardens.

Paul Dumbrell (born 1st September 1982), is an Australian V8 Supercar driver.

Background.
He currently resides in Melbourne, Australia, and races for the Jack Daniels Racing Team in the AVESCO V8 Supercar series. He was educated at Xavier College in Kew, Melbourne.

Racing History.
His first race was in karts in 1996 and by the end of 1997 Paul was looking to further his racing. He competed in the Australian Sprint Kart National Championships in April 1998 and then went to England to the Jim Russell International School of Racing.  During the course Paul had his first taste of a racing car, a Formula Vauxhall. Even though at age 15 he was the youngest and fastest graduate from the school, he was ineligible for the final race, for which drivers had to be 16.

On returning to Australia he looked to do a couple of races in Formula Ford but broke his hip when hit by a car while training on his mountain bike. This put him out for 8 weeks and put an end to any chance of running a Formula Ford.  At the end of 1998 he entered his first Touring Car race, the GT Production three-hour at Bathurst in a Subaru WRX, but luck was not on his side as his race ended with mechanical failure.  For the 1999 season he drove a Formula Holden in the Australian Drivers Championship, and had his first taste of the V8 Supercar series in August 1999 at Symmons Plains, Tasmania.

After a full year's experience in a Formula Holden, Paul had the chance to test a Formula 3000 car with Mark Webber for Paul Stoddart's Arrows Team, driving 20 laps in the car at Donington. When he returned back to Australia he fell into a permanent driving spot in Konica V8 Supercar Series.

2001 saw Paul running consistently at the front in the Konica Series with Race Wins, Pole Positions and the title well within his grasp - however 2001 was his bridesmaid year as preparation for winning the Konica V8 Supercar Development Series Championship in 2002.

2002 saw Paul Dumbrell picked up by Castrol Perkins Racing's Team Owner Larry Perkins as his co-driver in the Castrol Perkins Holden Commodore at both the Queensland 500 and Bathurst 1000.  At Bathurst that year, Perkins and Dumbrell finished a surprise 5th position overall. That 5th placing helped Dumbrell secure a lucrative 2-year deal with the Castrol Perkins Motorsport Team for 2003 and 2004. 

In 2005, Paul achieved his best-ever round result at Symmons Plains, Tasmania - the home of his first ever V8 Supercar start - ending the round in 5th place. 2005 also saw his best ever Driver's Championship placing, finishing in 20th, after placing 29th in 2003 and 24th in 2004. 

2005 also saw Paul nominated for Cleo Bachelor of The Year.  While he undoubtedly had the number 1 vote for Holden fans everywhere, it wasn't quite enough to secure him the title - but probably a few dates!

Current Standings.

So far in 2006, Paul has had an exemplary start to the season - driving the number 11 VZ Holden Commodore to 10th in the current championship standings... for this 24 year old, it would seem that the best is yet to come.

Paul had an excellent drive at the Bathurst 1000, finishing 5th, unlucky not to stand on the podium in the Great Race because of mechanical problems, but is definitely showing the form of an up and coming champ with some great drives so far in the 2006 season. It has been confirmed that Dumbrell will replace Greg Murphy at Super Cheap Auto Racing. But will stay in the Perkins "family" as Perkins Motorsport makes engines for Super Cheap Auto Racing.

Televerket was the name of the Swedish and Norwegian government agencies for telecommunications.

1 July 1993, the Swedish Televerket was in accordance with the Swedish parliament, Riksdagen's, decision made into a corporation, Telia AB, thus making Sweden the first European country to deregulate its telecom market. However, it shall be noted that Telia maintained their monopoly on the Swedish telecom market for many years to come. The name Televerket is nowadays used, by supporters of the deregulated system, in a degrading way when referring to Telia. Worth of notice is that old telephone poles and such are still marked with the Televerket logo. Telia has since merged with the Finnish Sonera, and is now known as TeliaSonera.

In 1994, the Norwegian Televerket was turned into a state owned joint stock company. It changed its name to Telenor the following year. In 1998 the telecom market was completely opened and deregulated. Following this, Telia created a Norwegian division and became one of Telenor's competitors. It wasn't until 2000 that Telenor was partly privatized.

It is interesting to note that a fusion between Telenor and Telia was planned in the latter half of the nineties, but this merge was cancelled 16 December 1999.

The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco is located in San Francisco, California, United States. It has one of the most comprehensive collections of Asian art in the world.

Until recently housed at the de Young in Golden Gate Park, the Asian Art Museum re-opened on March 20, 2003 in the former San Francisco city library building opposite the San Francisco Civic Center, renovated for the purpose under the direction of Italian architect Gae Aulenti of Musée d'Orsay fame.  The collection has over 15,000 works of art and artifacts from all major Asian countries and traditions, some of which are as much as 6,000 years old.  Major galleries are devoted to the arts of India, China, western Asia (including Persia), South-East Asia, Korea and Japan. There are 2,500 works on display in the permanent collection.

The museum owes its origin to a donation to the city of San Francisco by Chicago millionaire Avery Brundage, who was a major collector of Asian art. The Society for Asian Art, incorporated in 1958, was the group that formed specifically to gain Avery Brundage's collection. The museum opened in 1966 as a wing of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park. Brundage continued to make donations to the museum, including the bequest of all his remaining personal art collection on his death in 1975. 

In total, Brundage donated more than 7,700 Asian art objects to San Francisco, i.e. just over half the museum's current collection.  In 1995, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Chong-Moon Lee made a $15 million donation to launch the funding campaign for a new building for the museum.

The museum has become a focus for special and travelling exhibitions, including: the first major Chinese exhibition to travel outside China since the end of World War II (in 1975); an archaeological exhibition which attracted 800,000 visitors over an eight week period; an exhibition on Wisdom and Compassion opened by the Dalai Lama in 1991; and a display of the famous terra-cotta warriors of China's ancient city of Xi'an.

Beretta Model 93R is a selective-fire machine pistol. The "R" stands for "Raffica" which means burst in Italian. It was designed in the 70s and meant for police and military use, offering extra firepower in a small package. It is perfect for concealed carry purposes such as VIP protection, or for close quarters fighting such as room-to-room searches. 

A selector switch and the foldable foregrip allows the pistol to fire three round bursts with each pull of the trigger for a potential cyclic rate of 1100 rpm. The designers limited it to three round bursts to allow it to be more easily controlled. The 93R is basically a Beretta 92 series pistol (the Beretta 92FS is designated "M9" by the US military, and is the standard issue pistol for the US Army). But the 93R is single action and outfitted with a muzzle brake, an optional detachable shoulder stock and a 20-round magazine that also allowed for a firmer grip. It is currently out of production.

Hanare Kirishitans are Christians who, after the Roman Catholic Church was allowed back into Japan in the 1800's during the Meiji Restoration, did not rejoin the church and continued to practice their "hidden" version of Christianity. The Hanare Kirishitans have their roots in the Kakure Kirishitan's who were Christians that continued to practice Christianity during the 1600's and 1700's. The exact number is not known but shrines, called so because of fear of being called church, are still maintained. It has been suggested that Hanare Kirishitans can be classified as Protestant due to the fact that they did not rejoin to the Catholic Church and maintain their traditional beliefs.

William Stevens Fielding, PC (Halifax November 24, 1848-June 23, 1929 Ottawa) was a Canadian journalist, politician, and Premier of Nova Scotia. Fielding became leader of the anti-confederation Nova Scotia Liberal Party. In 1884, he became Premier and won the 1886 election on a pledge to remove Nova Scotia from confederation. When he failed to do this, he turned to economic matters including developing the coal industry. 

In 1896, he left provincial politics to become Minister of Finance in the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In 1910, he negotiated a reciprocity or free trade agreement with the United States which led to the government's defeat in the 1911 general election. Fielding lost his seat, and became editor of the Daily Telegraph of Montreal. 

Fielding supported the Unionist government of Sir Robert Borden during the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and returned to the House of Commons as a Liberal-Unionist member. Fielding had widely been seen as Laurier's successor but his betrayal of the party over the conscription issue cost him  the 1919 Liberal leadership convention where he lost to William Lyon Mackenzie King by 38 votes. He served again as minister of finance in King's first government formed after the 1921 election. He retired from politics in 1925.

In 1923, Fielding was sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom allowing him to be styled as Right Honourable, a rare privilege among Canadian politicians who have not been Prime Minister.

The "Tomahawk Buzzcut" is a shaving of the Atlanta Braves tomahawk logo and/or the word "Braves" into the hair of the back or side of a usually male head. It was an early 1990's fad of Atlanta Braves fans. The Braves' fans are well-known for their die-hard attitude as well as their creative ways of showing their attitude.

'Rockstar Ate My Hamster' is a management strategy computer game developed by Codemasters in 1988 and originally released on their full-price Gold label for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST. The game was written by Colin Jones, later to become known as author/publisher Colin Bradshaw-Jones.

The name of the game was inspired by a 1986 Sun headline - 'Freddie Starr ate my hamster', which served as a focal point for mid-1980s tabloid culture and helped further the career of the comic in question.

 Synopsis .
Desperate to get out of the circus theatrics business, Cecil Pitt and his sidekick, Clive, turn to the world of Rock Management with the help of a £50,000 inheritance.

 Objective .
To win the game, one must select a band, record an album and earn 4 gold discs within the space of a year.  If you fail to meet this target, go bankrupt or have no musicians left, the game is over.

 Gameplay .
The game is almost entirely menu driven with options that allow you to select your current decision.

Your first task as manager is to pick musicians for your band (see below), and then whether you'll buy them brand new equipment or, get some dodgy gear off the back of a lorry.  

Once in the main game, you have the option to:
 Practice - Lock your band away for up to 5 days so they can practice.
 Gig - Go on tour. This is the primary source of moneymaking in the game.
 Publicity - Organise a publicity stunt but be careful - it might just kill off your band members!
 Gifts - Buy your band some gifts to keep them sweet, otherwise they may make some rather costly ultimatums.
 Record - Once you've got a contract, you can choose to record your album.
 Release - Once the album's recorded, you can release it along with any singles.

Along the way, you'll also have to decide:
 Whether or not to play a charity gig. Some of the charities that contact you are real and others bogus.  Either way, you could end up with negative publicity if you snub a genuine charity or get duped by a bogus one.
 Whether or not to accept a sponsorship deal;
 Which recording contract is best for your band.
 What to do if a little organisation in Taiwan is pirating your records. Do nothing, sue them, buy them out or send in the heavies?

Releasing an album or single makes them eligible for the charts. A Top 10 Singles & Albums charts (depending on what you have released) gets displayed on screen every Sunday. The other bands in the Top 10 are also parodies of other rock bands.

 Musicians .
All the musicians you can hire in the game have names that parody real rock stars. Their weekly wage depends on their abilities and fame, ranging from £30,000 for Bill Collins down to just £50 for Sidney Sparkle.

W brze no (, ) is a town in Poland, in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, about 35 km northeast of Toru . It is the capital of the W brze no County.  The population is 13,971 inhabitants (2004).

The town is the birthplace of Walther Nernst, a chemist who in 1920 received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the Nernst equation, which gives the standard electrode potential of an electric cell containing various concentrations of electrolytes.

 History .
At the beginning of the 13th century, a Prussian trade route developed that crossed over an isthmus between two large lakes, the Friedecksee and the Schlosssee (English: Peace Corner and Castle lakes, respectively). A defensive wall was built at this spot, and later, a settlement named Wambrez was constructed there as well. The polish duke Konrad I of Masovia turned possession of the settlement over to the bishop of Che mno. However, this created problems. At the time, the Teutonic Knights were in control of the Che mno Land, and a dispute began between the Bishop of Che mno and the Knights. However, the Pope at the time, Innocent IV was not keen to continue the dispute. He installed the Bishop of Che mno as the rightful ruler of the settlement. This dispute was the first historical mention of the settlement, which at the time was still named Wambrez. In 1251, a large church, St. Simon and Judah, was built in the city. This established the name the Teutonic Knights referred to the city, Friedeck.

At the beginning of the 14th century, a revitalization of the church and the city was begun, lead by the then-current Bishop of Che mno, Herman von Prizna. A wall was also constructed around the city to further its protection, and a castle was constructed in the city's northwestern corner. However, the city, the wall, the surrounding villages, and the castle were all completely destroyed in the Thirteen Years' War between the Teutonic Knights and the Poles. Afterwards, all of these were reconstructed, and the castle at Wambrez served as the official residence of the Bishops of Che mno until 1773.

After the end of the Thirteen Years' war in 1466, which ended with the Peace of Toru , the city became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The city was again totally destroyed, this time in 1655 by Swedes during the second Polish-Swedish war. A major portion of the city also burned down in a devastating fire in 1700. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the city became a possession of the Prussian Kingdom, and between 1807 and 1815, the city was part of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1788, the city was renamed Briesen, which is still referred to in German. Another devastating fire destroyed much of the city in 1792, after which the city's castle was used to supply stones for the rebuilding of the destroyed areas of town.

The residents of Briesen, as it was called at the time, mostly made their living through agriculture and brewing. Industrialization arrived in Briesen in the middle of the 19th century. Industrial development flourished in the city due to its location and its access to railroads. By 1900, the city contained cement factories, as well as automotive and mechanical engineering centers. Along with this the traditional industries of the town were also modernized, with state-of-the-art breweries and creameries taking shape.

On January 20, 1920, Briesen was returned to the newly formed Polish state, and was renamed, W brze no, its current name. It was also made seat of its county. However, the city was invaded by Nazi Germany during World War II, and was a German possession between 1939 and 1945. During this time, nearly 4,000 residents of W brze no and the surrounding communities were sent to concentration camps. The Red army reclaimed the city, but this was hardly an improvement, as the Soviets conducted mass deportations even more extensive than those carried out under the German occupation. The city lost its status as county seat in 1975, but regained in 1999.

<doc id="4254245" title="Jakob Wimpfeling" nonfiltered="25" processed="25" dbindex="450024">
Jakob Wimpfeling (July 25, 1450 November 17, 1528 was a German Renaissance humanist and theologian.

Wimpfeling was born in Schlettstadt, Alsace. He went to the school at Schlettstadt, conducted by Ludwig Dringenberg. In 1464 he became a student at the University of Freiburg, where he received his baccalaureus in 1466; later he went to the University of Erfurt and the University of Heidelberg, where he received his magister in 1471; He then studied Canon law for three years, and finally theology. 

In 1483, he was cathedral preacher at Speyer. In 1498, Philip, the Elector Palatine, called him to Heidelberg as professor of rhetoric and poetry. From 1513, he lived at Schlettstadt, where a circle of pupils and admirers gathered around him. Differences of opinion on Lutheranism broke up this literary society. 

After Martin Luther's excommunication he took part in the attempt to prevail upon the Curia to withdraw the ban. This caused him to be suspected of having written a lampoon on the Curia, Litancia pro Germania, which was probably actually written by Hermann von dem Busche. 

In 1521, Wimpfeling submitted to the church, of which he was ever afterwards a loyal son. In 1524 he added to Jerome Emser's dialogue against Huldrych Zwingli's Canonis missae defensio in an open letter to Luther and Zwingli, in which he exhorted them to examine the scriptures carefully in order to discover for themselves that the Canons of the Mass contains nothing contrary to the doctrines and customs of the early Church. Wimpfeling then retired from the struggle, and was ridiculed by Lutherans as a renegade and a persecutor of heretics.

Wimpfeling's literary career began with a few publications in which he urged the more frequent holding of synods, the veneration of the Blessed Virgin, and an improvement of the discipline of the clergy. The Elegantiarum medulla (1493) is an extract from Valla's books on the elegance of the Latin language. In the Isidoneus germanicus (1496) he presented his pedagogical ideals, and opposed scholasticism. The teaching of grammar should lead to the reading of heathen writers who were not immoral and especially of the Christian writers. He also laid emphasis on learning the practical sciences. 

His most important work, Adolescentia (1500), was intended to supplement Isidoneus. Here he set forth the ethical side of his pedagogical scheme. The troubles of the Church spring from the bad training of the young; consequently, young people must be trained so as to be well-established in morals. He then discusses the details of twenty laws for young men. 

He showed himself a fiery patriot in the Germanic (1501), which involved him in a feud with Murner. His Epitome rerum germanicarum is a short history of the Germans, drawn in some particulars from other historians. In several writings he opposed abuses in the Church.

Yun Tong-ju (December 30 1917 - February 16 1945) was a Korean poet active during the period of Japanese rule.  Known for his writing of lyric poetry as well as resistance poetry, he was born in Hwaryong-hyeon, Gando, in present-day Manchuria, China.

Life.
Yun Tong-ju was the eldest son among the 4 children of his father Yun Yeong-seok and his mother Kim Yong.  As a child he was called "Haehwan" (  ,   ).  On December 27 1941, he graduated from Yeonhui Technical School, which later became Yonsei University.  He had been writing poetry from time to time, and chose 19 poems to publish in a collection he intended to call "Heaven, Wind, Stars, and Poetry" (            ), but he was unable to get it published.

In 1942, he went to Japan and entered the English literature department of Rikkyo University in Tokyo, before moving to Doshisha University in Kyoto six months later.  On July 14 1943, he was arrested as a thought criminal by the Japanese police and detained at the Kamogawa Police Station in Kyoto.  The following year, the Kyoto regional court sentenced him to two years of prison on the charge of having participated in the independence movement.  He was imprisoned in Fukuoka, where he died in Febrary 1945.  The following month, he was buried in Yeongjeong in Gando.

Posthumous activity.

In January 1948, 31 of his poems were published by Jeongeumsa, together with an introduction by Chong Ji-yong; this work was also titled Heaven, Wind, Stars, and Poetry.

In November 1968, Yonsei University and others established an endowment for the Yun Tong-ju Poetry Prize.

<doc id="186546" title="Ch?ya Nakahara" nonfiltered="34" processed="34" dbindex="450033">

 (29 April 1907 - 22 October 1937) was a poet active in early Showa period Japan.

Early life.
Nakahara Ch ya was born in Yamaguchi Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1907, where his father was an army doctor. In his early life, his father was posted to Hiroshima and Kanazawa, returning to Yamaguchi in 1914. In 1915, his younger brother died, and in sorrow he turned to composing poetry. He submitted his first three verses to a local newspaper in 1920, when he was still in elementary school. In 1923, he moved to the Ritsumeikan Middle School in Kyoto. He later graduated from the Foreign Studies Department of Tokyo Imperial University.

Literary career.
Initially, Ch ya favored poetry in the Japanese traditional tanka format, but he was later (in his teens) attracted to the modern free verse styles advocated by Dadaist poet Takahashi Shinkichi and by Tominaga Tar . 

After he moved to Tokyo, he met Kawakami Tetsutaro and Ooka Shohei, with whom he began publishing a poetry journal, Hakuchigun (Idiots). He was befriended by the influential literary critic Kobayashi Hideo, who introduced him to the French symbolist poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine, whose poems he translated into Japanese. The influence of Rimbaud went beyond just his poetry, and Nakahara came to be known for his "bohemian" lifestyle.

Ch ya adapted the traditional counts of five and seven used in Japanese haiku and tanka, but frequently tripped these counts with variations, in order to obtain a rhythmical, musical effect. Several of his poems were used as lyrics in songs, so this musical effect may have been carefully calculated from the start. 

Ch ya's works were rejected by many publishers, and he found acceptance primarily with the smaller literary magazines, including Yamamayu, which he launched together with Kobayashi Hideo, (although on occasion Shiki and Bungakukai would condescend to publish one of his works). He remained close friends with Kobayashi all of his life, despite the fact that his girlfriend left him for Kobayashi shortly after their first meeting. He eventually married and had a daughter who died in infancy, which sent him into a nervous breakdown from which he never fully recovered. Many of his later poems seem like remembrances and attempts to mitigate this enormous pain.

Ch ya died at the age of 30 of cerebral meningitis. Only one of his poetry anthologies, Yagi no Uta (Goat Songs, 1934) appeared while he was alive (in a self-financed edition of two hundred copies). He had edited a second collection, Arishi Hi no Uta (Songs of Bygone Days) just before his death. 

During his lifetime, Ch ya was not counted among the mainstream of poets, but his verses have a wide and increasing following even to this day. Ch ya is now a subject of classroom study in Japanese schools, and his portrait in a hat with a vacant stare is well known. Kobayashi Hideo, to whom Ch ya entrusted the manuscript for Arishi Hi no Uta on his deathbed was responsible for the posthumous promotion of his works, and Ooka Shohei for collecting and editing The Complete Works of Nakahara Ch ya, a collection containing the poet's uncollected poems, his journals, and many letters.

Legacy.
A literary award, the Nakahara Ch ya Prize was established in 1996 by  Yamaguchi city (with the support of publishers Seidosha and Kadokawa Shoten) in Ch ya's memory. The award is presented annually to an outstanding collection of contemporary poetry characterized by a "fresh sensibility" (shinsen na kankaku). The winner receives a cash award of 1 million yen, and the winning collection is also published in an English language translation.

<doc id="350279" title="Iraq Survey Group" nonfiltered="36" processed="36" dbindex="450035">


The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) was a fact-finding mission sent by the multinational force in Iraq after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs developed by Iraq under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Its final report is commonly called the Duelfer Report. It consisted of a 1,400-member international team organized by The Pentagon and CIA to hunt for suspected stockpiles of WMD, such as chemical and biological agents, and any supporting research programs and infrastructure that could be used to develop WMD. 

Formation.

The ISG was made up of more than one thousand Americans, Britons and Australians, with the United States providing the bulk of the personnel and resources for the operation. These people included civilian and military intelligence and WMD experts, as well as a large number people working to provide armed security and support. David Kay, a prominent U.S. scientist who searched for WMD after the first Gulf War, was chosen to head the group. The agency tasked as the head U.S. Government Agency of the ISG was a joint venture of the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency, the DoD counterpart to the CIA which is primarily responsible for inter-agency cooperation)

The Iraq Survey Group was the successor to the United Nations inspections teams, UNMOVIC led by Hans Blix and from the IAEA led by Mohamed ElBaradei, which had been mandated by the U.N. Security Council to search for illegal weapons before the conflict (See Iraq disarmament crisis).

 Organization and Operations .
To make the WMD search more manageable, ISG was operationally divided up into several sectors each with its own Sector Control Point. The three sectors were North, Baghdad and South, with Sector Control Point-Baghdad (also known as SCP-B or "skip bee") being the primary and largest. SCP-B and the core of the ISG staff were located on Camp Slayer at the former Al Radwaniyah Presidential Site on Baghdad International Airport in western Baghdad.

From its founding in the spring of 2003 until disbandment at the end of February 2005, SCP-B was commanded by a series of coalition officers from the U.S. Army, U.S. Marines and Australian Army. Its first commander was U.S. Army Reserve Colonel George Waldroup, who led the group from its founding until the summer of 2004. He was later picked by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to head the Strategic Support Branch of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Following COL Waldroup, USMC COL Frank Johnson was pulled from retirement and took the reigns until October 2004. COL Johnson was followed by Lt Col Carr, an Australian engineer, who was briefly followed by MAJ Peck (now LTC). The final commander of SCP-B was Australian Military Police Major Damien Hick.

SCP-B's missions included not only the search for WMD, but work on counter-terrorism and the ongoing investigation into the fate of U.S. Navy Captain Michael Scott Speicher, who was shot down during the Gulf War of 1991. Initially presumed dead, he was later declared missing when evidence emerged after the war that he had survived the crash of his aircraft.

SCP-B was organized into several Mobile Collection Teams, or MCTs, made up of members of American, British and Australian forces, with Americans providing the vast majority. An MCT generally consisted of a commander -- usually a major or captain (although MCTs were led by lieutenants and full colonels at times) -- and anywhere from ten to twenty other personnel, depending on mission requirements. The majority of SCP-B personnel were mobilized American National Guard or Army Reserve Soldiers (although the United States Navy, Marines and Air Force, as well several coalition forces, were also well represented) as well as some US Army Special Forces Personel. The other key piece of SCP-B were the U.S. Army Military Police crews assigned to the organization. The Military Police provided convoy and site security for the MCTs as well as secure transport for ISG personnel in their travels around Baghdad.  SCP-B also contained other special units, such as dog handlers (who were mostly civilian contractors), explosives ordnance disposal, ground-penetrating radar teams and a WMD transportation and storage group. 

By any measure other than the obvious (actually finding WMD stockpiles), SCP-B was remarkably successful. Acting as an independent entity outside of the normal chain of command (ISG reported directly to Rumsfeld), it surveyed and exploited hundreds of possible WMD sites across the breadth of Iraq with very few problems. Except for two unfortunate incidents, SCP-B's casualty record was exceptional, considering the amount of time its personnel spent on the roads and out among the populace. The first incident was the paint factory explosion of April 26th, 2004, which killed two Soldiers (US Army sergeants Lawrence Roukey, and Sherwood Baker) and injured several more. These were SCP-B's first casualties in over a year of operations. The second was a vehicle-borne IED attack against Charles Duelfer's convoy, which claimed the lives of two of Duelfer's PSD (SSG Clinton Wisdom and SPC Don Clary, both of the Kansas Army National Guard's 130th Field Artillery Regiment).

Throughout the life of ISG and SCP-B, there were only two occasions where chemical weapons were found. The first was a sarin mortar shell which had been reworked into a roadside improvised explosive device by insurgents. The second was a handful of 122-millimeter rocket warheads filled with inert mustard gas that was recovered near Babylon. Both were thought to be remainders from the Iran-Iraq War and were useless as offensive weapons. Both were later destroyed by ISG personnel. In late 2004 the ISG and the MCTs undertook some counter insurgency operations, although many details remain classified. There were other missions and organizations operating within the ISG which are Top Secret and are unlikely to be declassified anytime soon.

Interim Progress Report.
After six months searching for WMD, the ISG issued an Interim Progress Report on October 3, 2003.  The team has found evidence of "WMD-related program activities" but no actual chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. In addition to details of dormant WMD programs, the October 2003 report also includes discoveries of non-WMD programs banned by the U.N. and concealed during the IAEA and UNMOVIC inspections that began in 2002. The discoveries made by the ISG include a "clandestine network of laboratories . . . that contained equipment . . . suitable for continuing chemical biological weapons research" and vials of "live C botulinum Okra B from which a biological agent can be produced." . Lines of enquiry adopted by the ISG include the examination of sites across Iraq, as well as interviewing scientists, truck drivers and other workers with possible knowledge of WMD. The failure to find any stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons has proved a problem for Washington and London, who used intelligence indicating that Iraq did possess WMD stockpiles as one of the primary justifications for the invasion of Iraq. The British government, in particular, placed very heavy emphasis on this intelligence.

David Kay resigns.
On January 23, 2004, the head of the ISG, David Kay, resigned his position, stating that he believed WMD stockpiles would not be found in Iraq. "I don't think they existed," commented Kay. "What everyone was talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last Gulf War and I don't think there was a large-scale production program in the nineties." In a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kay criticized the pre-war WMD intelligence and the agencies that produced it, saying "It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most disturbing." 

Kay told the SASC during his oral report the following, though: "Based on the intelligence that existed, I think it was reasonable to reach the conclusion that Iraq posed an imminent threat. Now that you know reality on the ground as opposed to what you estimated before, you may reach a different conclusion- although I must say I actually think what we learned during the inspection made Iraq a more dangerous place, potentially, than, in fact, we thought it was even before the war."

Kay's team has established that the Iraqi regime had the production capacity and know-how to produce a great deal more chemical and biological weaponry when international economic sanctions were lifted, a policy change which was actively being sought by many United Nations member states. Kay also believed some components of the former Iraqi regime's WMD program had been moved to Syria shortly before the 2003 invasion , though the Duelfer Report Addenda (see below) later reported there was no evidence of this.

On February 6, 2004, Bush convened the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war and the failure to find WMD.  This was shortly followed by the conclusion of a similar inquiry in the United Kingdom, the Butler Review, which was boycotted by the two main opposition parties due to disagreements on its scope and independence .  In 2003, The U.S.-sponsored search for WMD had been budgeted for $400 million, with an additional $600 million added in 2004.

Kay's successor, named by CIA director George Tenet, was the former U.N. weapons inspector Charles Duelfer, who stated at the time that the chances of finding any WMD stockpiles in Iraq were "close to nil."

Duelfer Report.
On September 30, 2004, the ISG released the Duelfer Report, its final report on Iraq's WMD programs. The Key Findings are as follows:

 Saddam totally dominated the Regime s strategic decision making. ;
 Saddam s primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have UN sanctions lifted, while maintaining the security of the Regime.
 The introduction of the Oil-For-Food program (OFF) in late 1996 was a key turning point for the Regime. ;
 By 2000-2001, Saddam had managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support. ;
 Iran was the pre-eminent motivator of desire to rebuild Iraq's WMD capability.
 The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) judged that events in the 1980s and early 1990s shaped Saddam s belief in the value of WMD.
 The former Regime had no formal written strategy or plan for the revival of WMD after sanctions.

Operations Tempo 2004-2005.
Although the search for WMD had been conducted earnestly and fruitlessly during the initial year of the occupation, site exploitation continued through the summer of 2004. In late summer and early fall, the WMD search tempo slowed considerably; all of the most promising sites had been exploited in 2003-2004 and even most of the unpromising sites had been exploited by fall of 2004.

In late September and into October of 2004, the number of site exploitations increased significantly, although most of these were revisits to already-exploited sites - some of which had been altered by Iraqis in the intervening months. For instance: the former Iraqi Chemical Brigade headquarters building in Baghdad was in the midst of being converted to office space when ISG personnel returned for a second visit.

ISG's exploitation operations mostly ceased in early November of 2004. Most MCTs were disbanded and the personnel returned to their parent units and the MP teams that supported them were dispersed to other camps and given other missions.

In January 2005, the group announced the conclusion of its search.  The ISG stated that while it had, "not found evidence that Saddam possessed WMD stocks in 2003," they acknowledged "the possibility that some weapons existed in Iraq, although not of a militarily significant capability." 

March 2005 Report Addenda.
In March 2005 Duelfer added an addenda to the original report, covering five topics:
 Prewar Movement of WMD Material Out of Iraq, stating "ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place" but also acknowledging that "ISG was unable to complete its investigation and is unable to rule out the possibility that WMD was evacuated to Syria before the war.";
 Iraqi Detainees, concluding "the WMD investigation has gone as far as feasible. ... there is no further purpose in holding many of these detainees".
 Residual Proliferation Risks: People, concluding "former WMD program participants are most likely to seek employment in the benign civil sector, either in Iraq or elsewhere ... However, because a single individual can advance certain WMD activities, it remains an important concern".

<doc id="590260" title="Arak (distilled beverage)" nonfiltered="45" processed="45" dbindex="450045">
For the South East Asian liquor, see Arrack;


Arak or araq (Arabic:     IPA ) is a clear, colourless, unsweetened aniseed-flavoured distilled alcoholic drink, produced in the eastern Mediterranean, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel and Iraq.  The word comes from Arabic araq    , meaning "sweat" or "juice".  Arak is not to be confused with the similarly named liquor, arrack.

 Consumption .

Arak is usually not drunk straight, but is mixed in approximately 1/3 arak to 2/3 water, and ice is then added. This dilution causes the liquor to turn an opaque milky-white colour.  Arak is also commonly mixed with teas and juices.  Drinkers may also take arak with a chaser on the side. Arak is usually served with mezza, which could include dozens of small dishes, which many arak drinkers prefer as accompaniment rather than main courses. When the main course of the meal is served, it may hardly be touched, in favour of these smaller dishes. It is also well appreciated with barbecues, along with garlic sauce.

Tradition requires that water is added before ice, because if ice is added directly it results in the formation of an aesthetically unpleasing skin on the surface of the drink. For the same reason, an arak glass should never be refilled directly after being emptied; a clean glass must be used each time. In restaurants, when a bottle of arak is ordered the waiter will usually bring a number of glasses along with it for this reason.

 Preparation . 
It all begins with the vineyards, and the grapevine quality. The vine should be well mature, usually of a golden colour. The vineyards are not sprinkled, they are left to the care of the  Mediterranean climate, natural rain and sun. The grapes are cultivated in late September and October. The grapes are squeezed and put in barrels together with the juice (in Arabic El Mestarr), and left to ferment for three weeks. Occasionally the whole mix is stirred to release the CO2.

Now the first distillation, the goal is to get the alcohol out of the mixture that has fermented for three weeks. The distillation is done using the alembic or el karkeh also al karkeh, made of copper. It's basically three parts. The lower being a container used to boil what's inside (on fire). The middle part collects the vapors coming out of the boiling ingredients. The third part is used to cool the vapor that will be transformed to liquid and collected on its way out, usually in a container of glass. So the mixture of all the fermented and squeezed grapes is put into the lower part and it is boiled at a temperature around 80°C (boiling temperature of alcohol), but below 100°C (boiling temperature of water). The idea is to collect the alcohol in the container without any water.


Now the second distillation, here is made the actual final product. The alcohol collected in first distillation is to be distilled again but this time mixed with aniseed. The whole alembic is washed to remove all the remains of the precedent distillation. The alcohol and the aniseed are mixed together in the lower part of the karkeh (called in Arabic ddessett). The ratio of alcohol to aniseed may vary, it's one of the major factors of the quality of the final product. Another distillation takes place, usually on the lowest possible temperature. The procedure is very slow.

Traditionally a drinking party takes place at the same time. People would gather to help the producer and have a drinking party. This is one of the most prestigious and traditional parties of the Lebanese mountains. It usually takes place in November.

Note: Once the first distillation is done, it's not mandatory to have the second one immediately after.

 Variations .
One of the basic varieties, considered by many to be the prototypical arak, is distilled from grapes and anise.  Numerous varieties of arak are popular in all the countries edging the Mediterranean, and in parts of the Far East. In the Levant, it is distilled from fermented grape juice or, at times, sugar, and is considered by the inhabitants to be greatly superior to similar hard liquors in other countries. The same spirit is called Ouzo in Greece, Mastika in Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria and Rak  (another form of the word arak) in Turkey; they are made from a variety of products like grain, molasses, plums, figs and potatoes. Other similar drinks are the arak of Iraq, made from fermented date juice, and the zibib of Egypt, a peasant-made drink. An Iranian variant, called Aragh-e Sagi (Persian:        , literally dog's sweat), is produced without anise, and has a higher alcohol content than other varieties.  Further west, along the northern shores of the Mediterranean, the Italian anesone, French pastis and Spanish ojén, served as aperitifs or refreshers, are all sweeter versions of arak. Also, in the Far East, a comparable drink known as arrack, distilled from palm sap or rice, is very popular; in Korea it is known as Soju.  

While arak is extremely popular in Syria, the most prized brands are Lebanese, amongst them Ksara and, most famous of all, Massaya. Many Lebanese drinkers, however, themselves distil their own liquor. The quality of home-made arak (arak baladi) is considered far superior to commercial brands. Some restaurants occasionally serve home-made Arak at a very high price.

Many Lebanese towns are well known for their high quality home made Arak, among them Zahle in the Bekaa valley. The best quality can be found in Toula, a village in the Northern Lebanese Mountains. Toula is very well known across the north for its famous home made arak;you can find it in any restaurant in zgharta or ehden two important towns around that area.

The ABV differs from one version to another, with the most alcoholic reaching 80% or even more. The best quality arak is usually between 53% and 60%; when mixed with water it is diluted to 20-30%.

 History .
It is believed that arak was developed by the Christian and Jewish minorities of the Islamic Middle East. Jabir ibn Hayyan, a Muslim alchemist of the early Islamic era, invented the alembic, which facilitated the distillation of alcoholic spirits, the name used in Lebanon is al karkeh or little more formally al kattara. However, Muslims did not use his invention to produce alcoholic beverages since, in Islam, the consumption of alcohol is forbidden. Hence, his discovery was employed to distill perfume from flowers and to produce kohl, a women's eye cosmetic in which a black powder is liquefied, then converted to vapour and allowed to re-solidify. 

The Arabs carried the art of distilling kohl to Spain from where it spread to the remainder of Europe. In these Christian lands, it took on a much different use: the production of alcoholic drinks.  With the utilisation of this method of producing hard spirits, the Arabic name "al-kohl", which became alcohol, was adopted due to the similar method the Arabs used in manufacturing this cosmetic. The words in English relating to the art of distillation, besides alcohol, such as "alchemy", "alchemist", and "alembic" attest to the Arab origin of producing the many intoxicants found in western lands. 

Traditionally, arak was generally of local or village manufacture, but in the last few decades it has increasingly been produced in large manufacturing plants.  It has remained the preference of those who enjoy alcoholic drinks in the Middle East, in competition with the many drinks imported from the West.

Roland "Rollie" Miles (February 16, 1927 - August 17, 1995) was a professional football player for the Canadian Football League Edmonton Eskimos.  Miles played offence (running back),  defence (linebacker, defensive back), and special teams (kickoff/punt returner, punter), during his eleven career with the Eskimos.  Miles is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, and the Edmonton Eskimos Wall of Honour.

 Early life & college career .
Miles was born in Washington, D.C. and attended college at St. Augustine's College (Raleigh) in Raleigh, North Carolina.  At St. Augustine's, Miles excelled in baseball, football and track and field. Miles came to Canada to play baseball in Regina, Saskatchewan, but was convinced by the famed Annis Stukus to play football for the Edmonton Eskimos. He would continue to play semi-professional baseball in Canada during his CFL career.

 Professional football career .
Miles was one of the most versatile players in history of the CFL during his eleven year (1951 to 1961) career with the Edmonton Eskimos. As a defensive player (linebacker and defensive back), Miles intercepted 38 passes for 547 yards.  As a special teams player, Miles returned punts (finishing with 279 punt returns for 2,085 yards) and kickoffs (88 returns for 2,131 yards), and punted on occassion. On offence, Miles was often found in a backfield with such CFL greats as Jackie Parker, Normie Kwong, Johnny Bright, Bernie Faloney and Don Getty, he could run or pass on the option with skill.

Selected as a CFL Western Conference All-Star eight times (three at running back, three at defensive back, two at linebacker) Miles was also named the Eskimos' team Most Valuable Player three times.

Miles played in five CFL Grey Cup championship games, winning three during the Eskimos' dynasty of successive Grey Cup titles in 1954, 1955, and 1956. Miles played in the famous 1954 Grey Cup game with separated ribs, but still helped his underdog team win that classic game.

Miles was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1980.  The Eskimos added Miles' #94 jersey to its Wall of Honour in 1983. The City of Edmonton named the Rollie Miles Athletic Field in his honor.

 Later life and death .
Miles received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alberta in 1956, and began work in the off season with the Edmonton Catholic School Board, where he taught school and organized high school sports.  Miles continued working with the Edmonton Catholic School Board upon his retirement from the CFL in 1961.

Miles and his wife, Dr. Marianne Miles, had seven children: Craig "Tony" Miles, Rolanda Miles, Michelle Miles, Monica Lipscombe, Rollie Miles, Jr. (lineman on the University of Alberta Golden Bears 1980 Vanier Cup national championship football team, and Most Valuable Player of the 1980 Churchill Bowl), Brett Miles (noted singer, songwriter and saxophonist), and Mario Miles  (co-founder of the Millwood Grizzlies Minor Football Association in Edmonton in 1996, and coach from 1996 to 2003). 

Miles' grandson, Mario Miles, Jr. played for the Millwood Grizzlies from 1996 to 1999. Another grandson, Jefferson Lewis Miles, played football for the national champion Okanagan Sun Junior Team in Kelowna, British Columbia.

Miles passed away in 1995 at age 68, in Edmonton, and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The Top 2000 is a radio program on the Dutch radio station Radio 2, and has been broadcast since 1999. It is broadcasted annually at the end of the year, starting from 0:00 on Boxing Day (which the Dutch simply call "the second day of Christmas"), and continuing non-stop until 0:00 at New Year's Eve.

In these 6 days the 2000 most popular songs of all times are played. What those songs are is decided by the show's audience, through internet voting. The number 1 between 1999 and 2004 was the song "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen. In 2005 the Dutch song "Avond" by Boudewijn de Groot reached number 1, but in 2006 Queen retook the number 1 position.

Initiative.
The top 2000 was created in 1999 as part of activities surrounding the passing into the new millennium. The idea was to finish the year 1999, and enter the year 2000, with the 2000 best songs ever made. From the start of 1999, the listeners of Radio 2 were asked to select a song along with any special memories attached to the song, and send it to Radio 2 via mail or email. This way, 2000 so called "Millennium-songs" were collected throughout the year 1999. At the start of November 1999, these songs were placed on a website, and the voting was started. This led to the Top 2000. A sort like Top 2000 (but then filled with music from the nineties and recent music) was held on the Radio station "Radio 538", which featured a much younger audience, but this was a one time happening.

The first broadcast of the Top 2000 was a huge success, probably because of the combination of nostalgia, quality and the different genre's and time-periods of the songs, which all fit perfectly with the mood around the end of the millennium. 
Because of the success of the first broadcast, Radio 2 decided to make the program an annual happening, and each succeeding year the success of the Top 2000 has increased. Since its first broadcast, the program has been the most-listened-to program in the whole of the Netherlands. During the course of the broadcast in 2005, 6,2 million different people have listened to it. This is a huge number, considering that the total population of the Netherlands is about 16,4 million. Polls taken in 2006 showed that at least 9,2 people were planning to listen to the show.

In the years following 1999, the choice of songs for the top 2000 has been expanding rapidly through a new internet voting system where people could propose a new song to be added to the choice-list.

In 2002 a television show was added to the Top 2000, called the Top 2000 a Go-Go, which shows clips of parts of the list, along with interviews and other items. In 2005 the six parts of the show were watched by approximately 7,2 million people 

Since 2003, Radio 2, along with NPS, a public TV-broadcaster, has been organizing the Top 2000 in concert, where famous Dutch artists are invited to sing one of their favorite songs, along with one of their own songs. The concert is usually broadcast on New Year's Eve, right after the top 2000 has ended. The 2005 version was watched by about 3,9 million people.

2005.
In 2005, after 6 years, the Top 2005 received a new number 1. "Avond" by Boudewijn de Groot rose unexpectedly from the fifth place to the first place, driving the usual number 1, "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, to the second place.

Apart from the new number 1, the 2005 list featured a number of other improvements. During the voting, people could now add one song that was not in the list of songs to choose out. This way, a number of new, but also old songs entered the Top 2000 at high places. It was wondered whether certain songs, like "Nine Million Bicycles" by Katie Melua (which had been released only a few months earlier, and entered the charts at 23rd place), deserved to be at such a high place, and if they could hold onto that place in following years.

2006.
In 2005, easily a million votes were cast in the top 2000, but in 2006 this record was shattered when 1,9 million people cast their votes for the list. After the votes were counted, it was revealed that Queen had retaken their number one position, which they had lost in 2005.

<doc id="1167173" title="Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure" nonfiltered="58" processed="58" dbindex="450058">

Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is a video game programmed by Todd Replogle and published by Apogee Software in 1992. It is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game produced for the PC platform, and features 16-color EGA graphics at 320x200 screen resolution. 

Technical implementation.
The game's technology at the time was comparable and in direct competition with that of Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers 3 for the NES (which was released several years prior, but was still selling well at the time). Although Cosmo contained superior graphics capabilities in the form of three-layer masked horizontal parallax scrolling, this feature came at the cost of the game's frame rate. A file contained with the shareware version of the game urged people not to download it if their computers could not handle it.

 Story .
The storyline, intended for smaller children, is about a little alien boy named "Cosmo". Cosmo's parents are taking him to Disney World for his birthday. A comet hits their ship, forcing them to land on an unknown planet and repair the ship. Cosmo goes exploring, and when he returns, his parents are missing. Seeing large footprints, Cosmo thinks that his parents have been captured and sets off to rescue them before they are eaten. There are 3 episodes in the game series in which Cosmo must navigate through either 10 or 11 alien-themed levels.
 
 Endings .



At the end of the first episode, Cosmo unexpectedly gets swallowed by a large alligator-like creature. The story continues in the second episode, where Cosmo ends up in the creature's body and has to find a way out. At the end of the second episode, Cosmo finds the city where he thinks his parents might have been taken. In the final episode, Cosmo finds his parents and has a great time at Disney World for his birthday.



Gameplay.
Enemies and characters.
Many of these are not referred to by any name in the game, and are mentioned here by their appearance.

 Cosmo: The main character in the game, that the player controls around the levels. A special ability of Cosmo's is that his hands are like large suction cups. This allows him to hang onto certain surfaces, although he has a lot of trouble with icy surfaces because they're too slippery for Cosmo to have a firm cling to.
 Eye Plants: Pink stalks that have an eye growing in place of a flower. They appear on the ceiling or floor of a level. If you bomb an eye stalk, you'll get a free bomb returned to you, and if you bomb 15 eye stalks in one level, you will get 50000 points.
 Red aliens that you encounter during your travels, usually in habitable levels. They hurt Cosmo by biting him.
 Blue aliens that usually fall from the sky. They roll about on the floor, moving towards Cosmo, and if he touches one, it will hurt him.
 Aliens that have the look of a bird's head and shoot colorful bullets that can hurt Cosmo.
 Little birds that appear in most of the levels. These fly back and forth trying to peck at Cosmo.
 Worm: These are pink slug-like alien that appears every so often, sometimes from a box that is red with warning stripes (yellow and black) in the middle. It is harmless until you step on it and touch the bubbling puddle it leaves behind.
 Clam Plant: Just like the name suggests, these plants open and close every few seconds. Cosmo is hurt if he touches one when it is open.
 Ghosts that can hurt Cosmo but only advance towards him when his back is turned. They are similar to the Boo character of the Super Mario video game series.
 Robots that appears mostly in the levels of the series that have to do with electronics. The robots shoot bullets.
 Humanoid robots that are only faintly visible. If Cosmo jumps on one three times, it will become visible, and the fourth jump defeats it.
 Plant-like enemies that jump toward Cosmo when he is not looking.
 Plants that bite at you when you walk or jump over it. ;
 Robots with high energy laser beams that shoot upwards.
 Blue plants that grow out of walls and its head spits out a colorful bullet every so often.



 Zonk: The blue alien that you see at the "One Moment..." loading screen when you start the game, and the alien that helped Cosmo's parents to safety as later shown in Episode Three. Originally this was going to be Cosmo's name.
 Duke Nukem: Duke Nukem is found on Level 7, Episode 2 encased in a block of ice. You can bomb the ice to release him, in which case he will give you a cheeseburger (which increases Cosmo's health capacity). He refuses to help Cosmo as he is on a mission (to save the galaxy), but tells Cosmo to watch out for his next game: Duke Nukem II. In earlier versions of the game, Duke's name is displayed as Duke Nukum. See Duke Nukem for more information.



Items.
 Power Up modules: These colorful atom-shaped objects are Cosmo's life force. Collecting one of these restores one health unit.
 Bombs: Bombs can blow up almost everything you encounter.
 Stars: After every two levels you have an opportunity to enter a bonus stage, depending on the number of stars you collected during the levels. Reaching twenty-five stars gets you into one bonus stage; reaching fifty gets you into a different one.
 Hovercraft: allows Cosmo to fly.
 Shield: This cube breaks open and provides a temporary invincibility shield for Cosmo if he touches one.
 Hint Globes: Globules that are held up by a harmless bolt of electricity. These cause a message to be displayed if Cosmo runs into one. Blowing Hint Globes up will give Cosmo 12800 points.



 Cheeseburger: These add one empty health point to your health meter.
 One of them is hidden in Level 5, Episode 1 behind a wall inside a USA Earth satellite.
 Another is hidden in a crate at the end of Level 9, Episode 1.
 One is given to you if you free Duke Nukem in Level 7, Episode 2.
 Another is hidden in Level 9, Episode 2. It is to the far right, just below the exit, in a secret area. Cosmo reaches it by climbing down a wall a bit before.
 In Level 1, Episode 3, there is another in a crate near the start of the level, on top of a plant that raises and lowers.
 There is another in Level 8, Episode 3, but a red door blocks your way. The only way to get it is to find a red switch, which is hidden among flames.

The Reims-Cessna 406 Caravan II is a twin turboprop aircraft manufactured and designed by Reims Aviation in France in cooperation with Cessna. It is essentially a Cessna 404 with two Pratt & Whitney PT-6 turboprop engines and therefore similar to the pressurized Cessna 441. The aircraft first flew in 1983 and is still produced by Reims Aviation, which is now a private French aircraft manufacturer after buying back the shares held by Cessna in 1989.

The 406 is aimed at passenger and small cargo transport and civilian and military surveillance. For extra cargo capacity a cargo pod can be fitted to the belly of the aircraft. The Surpolmar is recent a maritime surveillance version of the aircraft with extra equipment such as a 360 degrees radar. 

Though the two engines make it more expensive to operate as similar aircraft such as the single-engined Cessna 208 Caravan, having two engines does make the aircraft more reliable, which is especially important when flying over rugged terrain or over water.

<doc id="56125" title="Sioux" nonfiltered="64" processed="64" dbindex="450064">





The Sioux (IPA ) are a Native American people. The term can describe any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or any of the nation's many dialects.  The Sioux are often divided into three main groups based on dialect and subculture:
Teton (translation uncertain): the westernmost Sioux known for their hunting and warrior culture. Often referred to as the Lakota.
Isanti ("Knife," originating from the name of a lake in present-day Minnesota): the extreme east of the Dakotas, Minnesota, and northern Iowa.  Often referred to as the Santee or Dakota.
Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana ("Village-at-the-end" and "little village-at-the-end") respectively.  Often referred to as the Yankton-Yanktonai or Nakota.

 Oceti Sakowin .

Today it is popular to refer to the Teton, Isanti, or Ihanktowan/Ihanktowana as either Lakota (otherwise known as the Sioux), Dakota, or Nakota respectively.  In any of the three main dialects, "Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota" all translate to mean "friend," or more properly, "ally".  Usage of either Lakota, Dakota, or Nakota may then refer to the alliance that once bound the Great Sioux Nation together.  The historical Sioux referred to the Great Sioux Nation as the Oceti Sakowin, meaning "Seven Council Fires".  Each fire represented an oyate (ethnic groups or nation of people).  The seven nations that comprise the Sioux are:
Mdewakanton, Wahpetowan (Wahpeton), Wahpekute, Sissetowan (Sisseton), the Ihantowan (Yankton), Ihanktowana (Yanktonai), and the Teton (Lakota).  The first four comprise the main branches of the Isanti (Santee or Dakota).

The name "Sioux" is an abbreviated form of Nadouessioux borrowed into French Canadian from Nadoüessioüak from the early Ottawa exonym: na towe ssiwak "Sioux". The Proto-Algonquian form *n tow wa meaning "Northern Iroquoian" has reflexes in several daughter languages that refer to a small rattlesnake (massasauga, Sistrurus). This information was interpreted by some that the Ottawa borrowing was an insult. However, this proto-Algonquian term most likely is ultimately derived from a form *- tow  meaning simply "speak foreign language", which was later extended in meaning in some Algonquian languages to refer to the massasauga. Thus, contrary to many accounts, the Ottawa word na towe ssiwak never equated the Sioux with snakes.

Today, many of the ethnic groups continue to officially call themselves "Sioux", which the Federal Government of the United States applied to all Yankton/Yanktonai/Santee/Lakota people in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, some of the tribes have formally or informally adopted traditional names: the Rosebud Sioux Tribe is also known as the Sicangu Oyate (Brule Nation), and the Oglala often use the name Oglala Lakota Oyate, rather than the English "Oglala Sioux Tribe" or OST. (The alternative English spelling of Ogallala is not considered proper.)

The earlier linguistic 3-way division of the Dakotan branch of the Siouan family identified Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota as dialects of a single language, where Lakota = Teton, Dakota = Santee and Yankton, Nakota = Yanktonai & Assiniboine.  This classification was based in large part on each group's particular pronunciation of the autonym Dakhóta-Lakhóta-Nakhóta. However, more recent research has shown that Assiniboine (and also Stoney) are not mutually intelligible with the Sioux groups, while the Yankton-Yanktonai, Santee, and Teton groups all spoke mutually intelligible varieties of a Sioux idiom. This more recent classification identifies Assiniboine and Stoney as two separate languages with Sioux being the third language that has three similar dialects: Teton, Santee-Sisseton, Yankton-Yanktonai. Furthermore, the Yankton-Yanktonai never referred to themselves using the pronunciation Nakhóta but rather pronounced it the same as the Santee (i.e. Dakhóta). (Assiniboine and Stoney speakers use the pronunciation Nakhóta or Nakhóda.)

The term Dakota has also been applied by anthropologists and governmental departments to refer to all Sioux groups, resulting in names such as Teton Dakota, Santee Dakota, etc. This was due in large part to the misrepresented translation of the Ottawa word from which Sioux is derived (supposedly meaning "snake", see above).

Modern geographic divisions.
The Sioux maintain many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations and communities in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and even Canada (southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba).

The Yankton-Yanktonai, the smallest division, reside on the Yankton reservation in South Dakota and the Northern portion of Standing Rock Reservation, while the Santee live mostly in Minnesota and Nebraska, but include bands in the Sisseton-Wahpeton, Flandreau, and Crow Creek Reservations in South Dakota. The Lakota are the westernmost of the three groups, occupying lands in both North and South Dakota. 

Yankton-Yanktonai (Nakota).
The Yankton-Yanktonai are a branch of Sioux peoples who moved into northern Minnesota. They originally constituted of two main ethnic groups: the Yankton ("campers at the end") and Yanktonai ("lesser campers at the end"). Economically, they were involved in quarrying pipestone.


It should be remembered that the 'divisions' of the old political organization of the Dakota Nations, collectively referred to as the Seven Council Fires, or O éti  akówi , is used to index the entire Dakota collective.  The word koda in Dakota (and kola in Lakota for example) means  friend  or  ally.   Therefore,  Dakota means an alliance of friends.  The root word is frequently come upon in the Siouan language, as in okodakiciye, meaning society, association, republic.  The tribe consists of seven bands closely related, springing from one parent stock  and still joined in alliance for mutual protection  (Doane Robinson 1904 :19).

The three 'divisions' are somewhat arbitrary and are based primarily on relatively minor dialectical differences; there are many kinship ties throughout the three groups, since these 'groups' were historically (and are probably today as well) much more fluid than discrete. Furthermore, due to land expropriation and massive social upheavals caused by the "Dakota-U.S. Wars" (circa 1862-1890), some members of all three groups fled to Rupert's Land, later the Northwest Territories of Canada (est. 1870).  Their descendants reside on eight small Dakota Reserves in Canada, four of which are located in Manitoba (Sioux Valley, Long Plain Tipi, Birdtail Creek, and Oak Lake ) and the remaining four (Standing Buffalo, Moose Woods Cap, Round Plain , and Wood Mountain) in Saskatchewan.



 Santee (Dakota) .
The Santee people migrated north and westward from the south and east into Ohio then to Minnesota.  The Santee Dakota were a woodland people who thrived on hunting, fishing and subsistence farming. Migrations of Anishinaabe/Chippewa people from the east in the 17th and 18th centuries, with muskets supplied by the French and English, pushed the Santee further into Minnesota and west and southward, giving the name "Dakotas Territory" to the northern expanse west of the Mississippi and up to its headwaters. The western Santee obtained horses, probably in the 17th century (although some historians date the arrival of horses in South Dakota to 1720), and moved further west, onto the Great Plains, becoming the Titonwan tribe, subsisting on the buffalo herds and corn-trade with their linguistic cousins, the Mandan and Hidatsa along the Missouri. Because the western bands of the Sioux find their origins in the east, the linguistical dialect of the Eastern Santee Dakota has come to be called the "Mother Dialect", or the originating dialect of the D/N/Lakota language.

 Teton (Lakota) .

The Santee people migrated north and westward from the south and east into Ohio then to Minnesota. The Santee were a woodland people who thrived on hunting, fishing and subsistence farming. Migrations of Anishinaabe/Chippewa people from the east in the 17th and 18th centuries, with muskets supplied by the French and British, pushed the Santee further into Minnesota and west and southward, giving the name "Dakota Territory" to the northern expanse west of the Mississippi and up to its headwaters. The western Santee obtained horses, probably in the 17th century (although some historians date the arrival of horses in South Dakota to 1720), and moved further west, onto the Great Plains, becoming the Titonwan tribe, subsisting on the buffalo herds and corn-trade with their linguistic cousins, the Mandan and Hidatsa along the   Missouri.

The clash of Sioux and white cultures.
The Appearance of the Sioux from the Eyes of a White Explorer of the Nineteenth Century. 

According to the journal kept by Jedediah Strong Smith, the fur-trapper, hunter and explorer who effectively opened up the West for later white settlement and gold prospecting, as reported by author Maurice Sullivan: 

 "...When he first saw the proud Sioux... who as Diah observed, were rovers... their intelligence, superior morals, stature and manner of living...such that here, in the Sioux nation, aboriginal life was most attractive." (pp. 16, 17) "The distant appearance of these lodges, when many Indians are encamped together, cannot fail of pleasing. Clustered together with their yellow sides and painted tops, the children playing around in the intervals between them, the men going out or coming in from hunting, the horses feeding on the neighboring prairie, the dogs sleeping or playing in the sun or shade, the squaws at their several labors, and the boys at their several sports--these, taken in conjunction with a beautiful mingling of prairie and woodland, or some undulation of the land, or some bend of the great River that brings them all at once to view, and above all, eyes that are not accustomed to such a sight, would almost persuade a man to renounce the world, take the lodge, and live the careless, lazy life of an Indian!" (p. 16) "The lodges of the Sioux, he recorded, were gaudily decorated with paintings of the buffalo hunt, battles and other events of historical importance to the occupants. Outside a warrior's lodge, on a tripod made of decorated poles, was hung the medicine sack of the owner, and over the sack a piece of scarlet blanket or the skin of a white wolf. ;
 Within, the squaw was busy with her household labors, while the master of the lodge was seated, 'leaning back, with no borrowed dignity', against a mat made of peeled willows supported by a tripod of sticks....In the moral scale, as their appearance would indicate, they rank above the mass of Indians." (p. 17) (see Bibliography below) Such was the approving opinion of at least one white mountain man of the time and indeed, many of these mountain men attempted to live in some fashion among the 'Indians'.

Forced Relocation of the Sioux by the United States Government. 

Later in the 19th century, as the railroads hired hunters to exterminate the buffalo herds, the Indians' primary food supply, in order to force all tribes into sedentary habitations, the Santee and Lakota were forced to accept white-defined reservations in exchange for the rest of their lands, and domestic cattle and corn in exchange for buffalo, becoming dependent upon annual federal payments guaranteed by treaty.  In Minnesota, the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 left the Sioux with a reservation twenty miles wide on each side of the Minnesota River.

The 1862 Sioux Uprising. 

In 1862, after a failed crop the year before and a winter starvation, the federal payment was late to arrive. The local traders would not issue any more credit to the Santee and the local federal agent told the Santee that they were 'free to eat grass or their own dung'. As a result, on August 17, 1862 the Sioux Uprising began when a few Santee men murdered a white farmer and most of his family, igniting further attacks on white settlements along the Minnesota River. The Santee then attacked the trading post, and the federal agent was later found dead with his mouth stuffed full of grass. No one knows the exact number but between 500 to 1000 civilian men, women, and children, mostly German immigrants, were massacred until state and federal forces put down the revolt . Courts-martial tried and condemned 303 Santee for 'war crimes'. Numerous first-hand accounts describe rapes and murders of the whites by the Santee. (Relatively recently published are the first hand accounts of two German-American women who describe the murders they observed of family and friends.) 
On November 5, 1862 in Minnesota, in courts-martial, 303 Santee Sioux were found guilty of rape and murder of hundreds of white farmers and were sentenced to hang. President Abraham Lincoln remanded the death sentence of 284 of the warriors, signing off on the execution of 38 Santee men by hanging on December 26, 1862 in Mankato, Minnesota, the largest mass-execution in US history. 

During and after the revolt, many Santee and their kin fled Minnesota and Eastern Dakota, joining their relatives in the West, or settling in the James River Valley in a short-lived reservation before being forced to move to Crow Creek Reservation on the east bank of the Missouri. Others were able to remain in Minnesota and the east, in small reservations existing into the 21st Century, including Sisseton-Wahpeton, Flandreau, and Devils Lake (Spirit Lake or Fort Totten) Reservations in the Dakotas. Some ended up eventually in Nebraska, where the Santee Sioux Tribe today has a reservation on the south bank of the Missouri.

 Derived names .
The U.S. states of North Dakota and South Dakota are named after the Dakota tribe.  One other U.S. state has a name of Siouan origin: Minnesota is named from mni ("water") plus sota ("hazy/smoky, not clear"), and the name Nebraska comes from the related Chiwere language. Furthermore, the states Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri are named for cousin Siouan tribes, the Kansa, Iowa, and Missouri, respectively, as are the cities Omaha, Nebraska and Ponca City, Oklahoma. The names vividly demonstrate the wide dispersion of the Siouan peoples across the Midwest U.S.

More directly, several Midwestern municipalities utilize Sioux in their names, including Sioux City (IA), Sioux Center (IA) and Sioux Falls (SD).  Midwestern rivers include the Little Sioux River in Iowa and Big Sioux River along the Iowa/South Dakota border.

Many smaller towns and geographic features in the Northern Plains retain their Sioux names or bear English translations of those names, including Wasta, Owanka, Oacoma, Rapid City (Mne luza: "cataract" or "rapids"), Sioux Falls/Minnehaha county (Mne haha: "waterfall"), Belle Fourche (Mniwasta, or "Good water"), Inyan Kara, Sisseton (Sissetowan: tribal name, origin uncertain), Winona ("first daughter"), etc.

Frontwoman Siouxsie Sioux of the postpunk band Siouxsie and the Banshees also derived her stage name from the "Sioux".

Access, the successor to ENGLISH, is an English-like query language used in the Pick operating system.

The original name ENGLISH is something of a misnomer, as PICK's flexible dictionary structure meant that file and attribute names could be given aliases in any natural language. For instance the command SORT could be given the alias TRIEZ, the file CUSTOMER the alias CLIENT, the attribute BALANCE the alias BILAN and the particle BY the alias PAR. This would allow the database to be interrogated using the French-language command string "TRIEZ CLIENT PAR BILAN", resulting in a list of customers by balance.

My Traceroute (former Matt's Traceroute), or mtr, combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a single network diagnostic tool. Like usual traceroute tools, mtr will probe routers on the route path by limiting the number of hops individual packets may traverse, and listening to responses of their expiry. It will repeat this process every interval, usually once per second, and keep track of the reponse times of the hops along the path.

 Software .

On modern Unix and Linux-based operating systems, the GNU GPL licensed mtr software is made available.  
In Microsoft Windows, a new utility, pathping, was introduced with Windows NT, combining ping and traceroute functionality in a somewhat similar way.
All these traceroute tools rely on ICMP Time Exceeded (type 11) packets coming back from routers, or ICMP Echo Reply packets when the packets have hit their destination host.

 Example .

 Origins .

The mtr manual page states that the original mtr program was written by Matt Kimball with contributions by many people. Take a look at the "AUTHORS" file in the distribution. Roger Wolff took over maintenance of mtr in october 1998.

 Uses .

mtr is often used for network troubleshooting.  By showing a list of routers traversed, and the average round-trip time as well as packet loss to each router, it allows the user to identify links between two particular routers responsible for certain fractions of the overall latency or packet loss through the network. This can help identify network over utilization problems.

Fort King (also known as Camp King or Cantonment King) was a United States military fort in north central Florida. It was named after Colonel William King, commander of Florida's Fourth Infantry and the first governor of the provisional West Florida region. The fort was built in 1827, and became the genesis of the city of Ocala. Located near the corner of East Fort King Street and 39th Avenue in Ocala, the site is a U.S. National Historic Landmark (designated as such on February 24, 2004).

History.
Prehistory.
Archaeological investigations have indicated that the area was inhabited prior to the arrival of the white man in the area. At least two periods of occupation have been identified: between 6500 and 2000 B.C., and 200 to 1500 A.D.

The fort.
Fort King was constructed in 1827 as a buffer between the Seminoles (to the south in the Moultrie Creek Treaty reservation area) and whites settling in the region. It sat at the nexus of a system of military roads. From the fort, one could travel easily (for the era) to Fort Brooks (near Orange Springs), Fort McCoy, a ford at the St. Johns River which would become the town of Astor, Palatka, Jacksonville, and Fort Brooke (on Tampa Bay, to name but a few. It fell into disuse after 1829.

In 1832, the fort was active again to help in the relocation of the Seminoles westward as part of the Treaty of Payne's Landing. The Second Seminole War, beginning in 1835, made the fort one of the most important during the next seven years, due to its strategic location. Abandoned for nearly a year between mid-1836 to early 1837 after the Seminoles burned it, the fort still remained mostly in use until the war's end in 1842.
After the founding of Marion County, the fort became its first courthouse in 1844. Eventually, though, the building was abandoned for the last time, and the fort deconstructed to provide building material for the early residents.
Recent.
Today there are no signs of the fort. Two historical markers exist, one marking the approximate location of the fort itself, the other at the cemetery for it. Some of the area is publicly owned, and some is private.

<doc id="1639919" title="George Taylor Denison III" nonfiltered="70" processed="70" dbindex="450070">


George Taylor Denison III (31 August 1839   1925) was a Canadian soldier and publicist.

He was born in Toronto, and educated at Upper Canada College. In 1861 he was called to the bar, and was from 1865-1867 a member of the city council. From the first he took a prominent part in the organization of the military forces of Canada, becoming a lieutenant-colonel in the active militia in 1866. He saw active service during the Fenian raids of 1866, and during the North-West Rebellion of 1885.

Owing to his dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Conservative ministry during the Red River Rebellion in 1869-70, he abandoned that party, and in 1872 unsuccessfully contested Algoma in the Liberal interest. Thereafter he remained free from party ties. In 1877 he was appointed police magistrate of Toronto. 

Colonel Denison was one of the founders of the Canada First movement, which did much to shape the national aspirations from 1870 to 1878, and was a consistent supporter of imperial federation and of preferential trade between Great Britain and her colonies. He became a member of the Royal Society of Canada, and was president of the section dealing with English history and literature. The best known of his military works is his History of Modern Cavalry (London, 1877), which was awarded the Czar of Russia Prize in an open competition in 1879, and has been translated into German, Russian and Japanese. It remains one of the definitive works on the subject. In 1900 he published his reminiscences under the title of Soldiering in Canada.

He was a public defender of Upper Canada College, and was also known for virulent Anti-Americanism; after a proposal was made to erect a statue of George Washington in Westminster Abbey, he threatened that if it was built he would go there to spit on it.  Following the attempts by the Fenian raiders to "liberate" Canada between 1866 and 1871, Denison claimed a Yankee sword from the battlefield and used it as a poker to use on his fire.

Brickhouse Betty is an adult cartoon character featured online on numerous popular websites, including Newgrounds and Jokaroo.  Betty is the brainchild of Rum Runners, a rum-drinking duo known only as "Sven & Angus" in the adult film and Internet world.  She is also the star of the only adult animated short to ever win an AVN Award.  The cartoon "Stormy Bangs Betty!", co-starring adult film superstar Stormy Daniels, was part of Wicked Pictures' win in 2006 for "Best DVD Extras." Brickhouse Betty.net is one of the most popular cartoon sex and porn sites in the world.

Betty started out as a feature on the Australian humor site, SexyAndFunny.com and later migrated to her own online home, BrickhouseBetty.net. Since the character's humble beginnings in 2003, her popularity has grown immensely.  The site is currently the number one free adult cartoon site in the world according to Alexa and Google Directory.  She is the modern day version of Playboy's "Little Annie Fanny" except that Betty actually does what fans always wished Annie would do. In fact, Betty cartoons are actually run on Playboy TV on the hit show "Night Calls".

Betty's Traits.
Betty is considered as the typical dumb blonde. She is kind and innocent, but is a bit dull and gullible and the men in the episodes use that to persuade her into their sexual joy. In fact, in every episode, she ends up topless, and except for the Easter Blonde episode, completely naked. Another irony is that although there are chances where Betty could hang out with a more handsome figure (for instance, JD in Irish Blonde and Lifesaver Betty episodes), in the end, it is the unattractive men who rape her.

An interview on Boites Jaunes.com reveal that she went to the University of Copenhagen, where she did a performance of "Annie Get Your Gun", and had Niels Bohr as a friend. She also knows a little about special relativity, yet does not seem to be able to do simple math. She calls herself of a "cat person". She says that she is a very good waitress, but she continuously says that she does not like leprechauns. She wants to be a beaver.

Other Characters.
 Santa: First seen in "Irish Blonde" as a bartender, but in his original form in "The Christmas Blonde 2". A jolly figure, but sometimes gets violent in front of those who rape Betty. He saves Betty on two occasions, on the latter two episodes of the Christmas episodes.

 Grandpa Slappy: First seen in "Christmas Blonde", but properly introduced in "The Vacation Blonde". His name is revealed in "The Christmas Blonde 2", when his cover is blown. He is a sex-crazy, balding old man with a cane, who raped Betty twice.

 JD: First seen in "Jungle Blonde" as a Tarzan-like man. His proper name is introduced in "Lifeguard Betty". He is a sun-tanned, attractive, hunky Australian, who makes gorilla sounds and tries to get close to Betty. He also cameos in "The Christmas Blonde 2" as a policeman who arrests Grandpa Slappy's plan to get sexual pleasure from Betty.

 Sven: First seen in "Irish Blonde", as a leprechaun who gives three wishes to Betty. His real intention was to set himself up to sexually exploit Betty by undressing her while enlarging his penis and growing himself into a hunk. Later, he is shown as a policeman in "The Christmas Blonde 2".

 Augus: First shown in "Easter Blonde", he is dressed as an Easter Bunny in a shopping mall. Seeing how attractive Betty is, he sticks his penis in a basket and introduces it to Betty as an "Easter whistle", which makes her pull orgasms on Augus.

 Frank: First shown in "Dick or Treat", Frank is a Frankenstein-like monster, who trick-or-treats in front of Betty's door. When Betty says that she is out of candy, he instead strips both of them and starts raping Betty. He also releases an excess amount of semen.

 The Puppeteer: First shown in "Christmas Blonde 3: The Snatch", he kidnaps and rapes Betty, while Betty is blinded and thinks that Santa abducted her to Sugar Plum Factory to rape her.

 Episodes .

 "'The Christmas Blonde'";
Betty is waiting for Santa to come, wearing only a red bra and red panties. Santa appears, comments "sweet Jesus" and pretends to faint. He uses a puppet to tell Betty that the only way to wake up Santa is to give him a blowjob. The episode ends as Betty wondering if she should do it.

 "'The Vacation Blonde'";
An old man called Grandpa Slappy passes by a window at a hotel. He hears orgasmic noises coming from a room and peeks in. Naked Betty is bouncing up and down on a bed. She appears to be having sex, but turns out to only be trying to close her suitcase.

 "'The Jungle Blonde'";
Betty is swinging through the jungle on a vine in a leopard bikini. A Tarzan-like man, who is revealed in later episodes to be named JD, follows and eventually grabs her. In the next scene, JD strips her and they have intercourse in several positions and then JD swings away, smoking a cigarette. A chimpanzee then makes a sexual gesture at Betty.

 "'The Irish Blonde'";
Betty is depicted as a waitress during St. Patrick's Day. She meets a leprechaun named Sven who offers three wishes. Her first is that all of the men in the tavern are interested only in her, a wish that is granted by stripping her naked. Betty screams, but everybody in the room IS interested only in her. Her second wish is a man "hung like a horse". Sven turns out to be this man, extending his penis to almost as long as he is tall, while forcing Betty into fellatio. Betty's third wish is that she wanted a hunky man, and Sven becomes hunky and naked as well. They fall over and have sex on the floor. Grandpa Slappy then says to the bartender, Santa, "I'll have what he's havin'."

 "'The Easter Blonde'";
An Easter-bunny-costumed man named Angus is working at a shopping centre. Betty appears to think he is the real bunny, and Angus takes it as a sign of stupidity. He tricks her into looking away (saying that there is a leprechaun), then punches out the bottom of the basket and sticks his penis through. He describes it as an Easter whistle and suggests she blow on it. While Betty tries it, her top falls off. When it proves to not work, he advises her to suck on it. It still doesn't work, and Betty then notes that she can't get it out of the basket. She yanks on it. Angus cums all over her, and Betty realizes what has just happened as Easter-egg patterned semen is sprayed on her breasts.

 "'Lifeguard Betty'";
Betty works as a lifeguard along with JD. JD asks her for a mouth-to-mouth, which she says is only for drowning people. Grandpa Slappy overhears this and pretends to drown. Betty runs down the beach towards him, Baywatch-style. Her bikini comes off in the process, leaving her completely naked, and she gives him mouth to mouth among other types of CPR. He gets an erection which bursts through his shorts and into Betty's anus.

 "'The Christmas Blonde 2"';
This is the sequel of "The Christmas Blonde", produced one year after the original. Betty, now topless, gives Santa the blowjob she was supposed to in the previous Christmas Blonde episode, saying that it is for the children of the world. Meanwhile, the Santa Claus seems to enjoy it. Then, another Santa Claus comes down the chimney and fights the other. The Santa Claus is revealed to be Grandpa Slappy in disguise. JD and Sven, appearing as policemen, appear and arrest Slappy. The real Santa calls Slappy "a very naughty boy." The real Santa apologizes to Betty. When Betty asks how she can repay him, Santa pulls out the puppet and begins "Well...", probably suggesting a sexual activity much as the Santa impostor did.

 "'Dick or Treat'";
A "Brickhouse Betty Quickie". It is Halloween and a Frankenstein-like monster named Frank appears at Betty's house and asks for candy. Betty tells him she has no candy, but Frank notices her very large breasts and strips her and himself naked. Betty then notices that she is naked. Lightning flashes and he rapes her in various ways. Grandpa Slappy yells "It's alive!" In the end, Frank urinates an excess amount of semen.
This episode is the first time that Betty actually yells that she is being raped.

 "'The Christmas Blonde 3: The Snatch'";
This is the sequel of The Christmas Blonde 3. Betty, wearing very revealing bikinis, is sunbathing with Santa who is relieved from the Grandpa Slappy incident. Betty is kidnapped by The Puppeteer, who is revealed to be an old employee of Santa's. The Puppeteer sends two women who look exactly like Betty but for their skin and hair color, named Holly and Jolly, to distract Santa while the Puppeteer has sex with Betty. Santa resists and rescues Betty.

Gouin Street Arena is the predecessor to the Sault Memorial Gardens, Sault Ste. Marie's premier sports complex from 1949-2006.  It was located on Gouin St. between Queen and Bay Streets near East Street.  The Arena housed in-season ice surfaces for both ice hockey and curling.  The building's seating was bench-style (in much the same fashion as the Memorial Gardens) and capacity was around 1000.  The building was destroyed by fire in 1945.

<doc id="5314198" title="Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg" nonfiltered="77" processed="77" dbindex="450077">
Frederik Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg (1765 - 1814) was a Danish prince and feudal magnate. He held the island of Als and some other castles (such as Sonderborg) in Schleswig.

He was born as the eldest son of Duke Friedrich Christian I of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1721-1794) and his cousin Princess Charlotte of Holstein-Plön (1744-70). Until his father's death, he was styled Hereditary Prince of Augustenborg.

He was a prince with an exceptionally high dose of Danish blood in his ancestry, his maternal grandmother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother having been, respectively, born Countess of Reventlow, Countess of Danneskiold-Samsoe and Countess of Ahlefeldt-Langeland. He was closely related to all important families of the then high nobility of Denmark. The negaive side was that his ancestry was quite much "comital", instead of including royal princesses, and duchesses of petty German states, as was customary with the Oldenburg royal family. Their family was regarded as a bit lower than the Ebenbuertige small rulers of Germany thought to be the standard.

In 1786 the 20-year-old hereditary prince however married his distant cousin, the 14-year-old Louise Auguste of Denmark and Norway (1771-1843), daughter of the late Queen Caroline Mathilde of Denmark. Louise Auguste was born during queen's marriage with the insane king Christian VII of Denmark and Norway, but unofficially it was widely known that her natural father was Johann Friedrich Struensee, the king s court physician and de facto regent of the country at the time of her birth. (She was referred to sometimes as "la petite Struensee".)

The story of antecedents of the prince's marriage goes as follows: In February 1779 the nation's foremost statesman, Chief Minister count Andreas Peter Bernstorff, hatched an ingenious plan for the young princess. Something that has been often customary with royal children suspected of not being sired by their nominal fathers but by mother's illicit liaison: to marry such to another member of the royal house. Since a male child of hers could inherit the throne some day, it would be advantageous to arrange a marriage early, and to marry the "half-royal" back into the extended royal house, to the Hereditary Prince of Augustenborg. This plan not only had the positive effect of more closely connecting the Danish royal house s two lines, the ruling House of Oldenborg and the offshoot House of Augustenborg, thus discouraging the threat of a breakup of the kingdom, but also the prevention of her marriage into the Swedish royal house (the latter danger was rather low, however: at that time, there were Swedish princes only twenty years or more her senior, and her first cousin, the future Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden had just been born when she already was seven).

The binding agreements were made in 1780, and in spring 1785 the young duke Frederik Christian II came to Copenhagen. The engagement was announced then, and a year later, on May 27, 1786 the wedding took place at Christiansborg Castle.  

They lived at the Castle for many years until the Christiansborg Castle fire of 1794 and the death of his father, the Duke of Augustenborg (Frederik Christian I). The prince inherited the estate and the Duchy.

After 1794 they lived during the summer on the island of Als and at Gråsten.

The couple had three children:
 Caroline Amalie (b. Sept. 28, 1796 Copenhagen - d 9.3.1881), married 1815 Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark (d 1848), the future Christian VIII of Denmark and earlier, 1814, proclaimed king of Norway, briefly before Swedish conquest. Became Queen of Denmark. She died childless 1881, as HM The Queen Dowager of Denmark.

 Christian August (b. July 19, 1798 Copenhagen - d 11.3.1869),  the Duke of Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (who was to become a pivotal figure in the Question of Schleswig-Holstein in 1850's and 1860's). In order to hold to potential Danish feelings, he was married in 1820 to a Danish relative, Countess of Danneskjold-Samsoe (Lovisa-Sophie Danneskjold-Samsøe, 1797-1867), relative of kings of Denmark, belonging to a bastard branch of House of Oldenburg. Duke Christian sold his rights to the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark in aftermath of Treaty of London, but later renounced his rights to the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in favor of his son Frederik August. He was the brother-in-law of King (Christian VIII). And nephew of late Frederik VI. Duke Christian August died 1869. Father of e.g: Frederik August (Friedrich Christian August), Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, born 1829 in Augustenborg. He was nephew of Caroline Amalie, the incumbent Queen Consort of Denmark, and "nephew-in-law" of the king himself. As well as a great-nephew of Frederick VI.  In 1863 claimed to succeed King Frederik VII of Denmark as Duke of Schleswig-Holstein. Died 1880. He became father of one surviving son and a number of daughters.

 Frederik Emil August (b. Aug. 23, 1800 Kiel - d 2.7.1865 Beirut), the  Prince  of Nør (Noer). Married 1829 Countess Henriette Danneskjold-Samsøe (1806-58) who was a Danish noblewoman and relative of kings of Denmark, belonging to a bastard branch of House of Oldenburg. Later he was created Prinz von Noer (1864) and died 1865. Father of:
 Friedrich Christian Karl August (Gottorp 1830-Noer 1881);
 Luise Karoline Henriette Auguste Gfn von Noer (Schleswig 1836-1866);

Over the years there developed conflict between him and Louise's brother king Frederick VI of Denmark, especially over the relationship of the double-duchies of Schleswig-Holstein and his small appanage around Sonderborg there on one hand and the Danish monarchy on the other. His wife remained loyal to the Danish Royal House throughout the differences.

In 1810, his younger brother Charles August of Augustenburg became chosen by Swedes as their new crown prince, to succeed Charles XIII of Sweden. He however died during the spring.
Soon the duke himself pursued attempts to be chosen as successor to the Swedish throne. However, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Marshal of France and Prince of Ponte Corvo, got elected. His wife opposed the Swedish affair and orked actively to undermine the duke's opportunity.

Their relationship eventually fell apart, and Frederik Christian tried to legally limit her influence over their children s future.  He died on June 14, 1814.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Christian, Duke of Augustenborg, then 16 yo. Louise Auguste took control of the Augustenborg estates and the children s upbringing.  The estate was turned over to the son and heir on his return from an extended foreign tour in 1820.

<doc id="6516350" title="Radioactive dentin abrasion" nonfiltered="79" processed="79" dbindex="450079">

A procedure for the measurement of either tooth enamel or dentin abrasion by the use of human teeth made radioactive by mild neutron irradiation.

Abrasive is the term for a dentifrice cleaning agent which, in concert with the brushing action of the toothbrush, cleans teeth by dislodging food particles and plaque. Several abrasives or cleaning agents are currently marketed in various toothpastes, including dicalcium
phosphate, hydrated silica and sodium bicarbonate or baking soda.

Radioactive dentin abrasion method of measurement  of dentifrice abrassivenes toward  human teeth was described in 1958 by researchers R. J. GRABENSTETTER, R. W. BROGE, F. L. JACKSON, AND A. W. RADIKE in their article THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ABRASION OF HUMAN TEETH BY DENTIFRICE ABRASIVES: A TEST UTILIZING RADIOACTIVE TEETH.

The procedure is more precise and faster than former methods dependent upon the measurement of the depth of a groove cut into tooth structure. (The former methods was first studied by W. D. Miller in 1907). The results are obtained directly in terms of the amount of human tooth structure worn away by a toothbrush and dentifrice abrasive slurry operating at a known, constant brush pressure and a constant stroke speed. The coefficient of variation of the test is 6-7 when 8 replications are carried out, and 10-15 when only duplicates are run as in the usual routine testing. This is one half to one fourth of the variation involved in the depth-of-cut method and results can be obtained with an expenditure of one half to one third of the time of the former method.

The procedure was later adopted by ADA for measuring of Relative Dentin Abrasion Index,

Live/Dead is the first official live album released by the San Francisco-based band Grateful Dead. It was recorded over a series of live concerts in early 1969 and released later in the year on November 10. At the time of its release, Robert Christgau wrote that parts of the album contained "the finest rock improvisation ever recorded." A landmark live album that captured the Grateful Dead's improvisations at their best   All Music Guide would write that "Few recordings have ever represented the essence of an artist in performance as faithfully as Live/Dead"   it is also the final album with keyboardist Tom Constanten. 



History.
The songs were recorded with a mobile 16-track studio. Owsley "Bear" Stanley also asked Ron Wickersham to invent a mike splitter that fed both into the PA and the record inputs with no loss in quality. "Dark Star" and "St. Stephen" pairing was taken from the February 27, 1969 show at the Fillmore West; "The Eleven" and "Turn On Your Lovelight" were from the January 26, 1969 show at the Avalon Ballroom; "Death Don't Have No Mercy," "Feedback," and "And We Bid You Goodnight" were from the March 2, 1969 show at the Fillmore West.

Unlike in later years, in early 1969 the contents of the Dead's set lists varied little.  They improvised the medley of "Dark Star"/"St. Stephen"/"The Eleven" several times a week, which enabled them to explore widely within the songs' simple frameworks. The album was a financial success for the band in the eyes of their label, Warner Bros. Constanten had commented that "Warner Bros. had pointed out that they had sunk $100,000-plus into Aoxomoxoa ... so someone had the idea that if we sent them a double live album, three discs for the price of one wouldn't be such a bad deal."

<doc id="7078291" title="Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand" nonfiltered="82" processed="82" dbindex="450082">

Bishop of Zealand; born at Køge (20 m. south west of Copenhagen), Zealand, August 5, 1585; died at Copenhagen April 19, 1652. 

He studied at Herlufsholm, Copenhagen, Leyden, and Franeker; became rector of Herlufsholm academy 
1608; professor pædagogicus, University of Copenhagen, 1610; professor of Greek 1613; member of the theological faculty 1615. In 1617 he was appointed teacher to Prince Christian, son of King Christian IV., but returned to the university three years later. At this time Denmark was disturbed by Roman Catholic propaganda, and Brochmand made the controversy with Rome a subject of his public lectures. In 1626 28 he published Controversiæ sacræ (3 parts), a reply to Bellarmine's attacks on the Lutheran Church, and in 1634, at the king's order, he engaged in a polemic 
with the Jesuits, who endeavored to defend the conversion of Margrave Christian William of Brandenburg to Catholicism. In their final reply the Jesuits stigmatized Brochmand as a "disturber of the Roman empire, the boldest despiser of His Imperial Majesty and the Catholic rulers, a poisonous spider, and a degenerate Absalom." Against this pamphlet Brochmand delivered a series of lectures which after his death were collected and published under the title Apologiæ, speculi veritatis confutatio (Copenhagen, 1653). He was ordained bishop of Zealand in 1639, and during his long and fruitful activity in this office reorganized the Danish church service, especially by abolishing the Latin choir, and by introducing Wednesday services during Lent. His reputation as a dogmatist was established by his Universæ theologiæ systema (2 vols., 1633) in which he proved himself a bitter opponent, not only of the Roman Catholics, but also of the Reformed, whom he calls "enemies of God and of truth." He wrote several devotional works, of which his Sabbati sanctificatio for more than two centuries was a favorite collection of sermons with the Danish people.

"Born to the Purple" is an episode from the first season of the science-fiction television series Babylon 5.

Plot synopsis.


Londo Mollari is being forced into negotiating with the Narn. He would rather be pursuing a new love interest though. The love interest, Adira Tyree, is actually the slave of an alien named Trakis. He is using her to get his Purple Files, a stash of dirt and information on Centauri's elite that he hopes to sell to the highest bidder. Londo promotes Vir Cotto to diplomatic status to negotiate with the Narn while he pursues Adira.

Meanwhile Michael Garibaldi has discover unauthorized use of the Gold Channel communications network, which he attempts to track down. Eventually he locates this to Susan Ivanova using it to talk to her dying father back in Russia on Earth.

Adira, having drugged Londo and got hold of his purple files, is about to meet her master. She starts to have second thoughts about the deception and makes a run for it.

Sinclair is able to trick Trakis into divulging Adira's whereabouts. Trakis is then triumphantly floored by a punch from Londo and Sinclair is able to locate Adira and return the crystal to Londo.

Adira, despite Londo's pleading, decides to leave the station.

Arc significance.

Adira Tyree's return to Babylon 5 plays a major part in the third-season episode "Interludes and Examinations."

This episode marks the first real development of Londo's character, as he shows a great deal of tenderness and genuine emotion to counterbalance his usual Machiavellian cynicism.

Production details.

"Born to the Purple" was originally titled "Amaranth." 

Trivia.
The color purple was very popular in Roman times as a color of state. The dye used to make it was expensive and so use of it gave a certain status. Purple porphyry rock was extracted only from the Egyptian desert. Being porphyrogenitus ("Born to the Purple"), in the porphyry chamber of the Constantinople palace is an indication that the person was part of the imperial family of the Eastern Roman Empire. He was born in the purple. Edward Gibbon.

The cemetery is located near the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) at Wolf and Roosevelt Roads.  It is adjacent to two other cemeteries, those being Queen of Heaven Cemetery, another Catholic Cemetery, and Oakridge Glen Oaks Cemetery.

In 1901 Mount Carmel Cemetery was consecrated.  The cemetery maintained its own office until 1965, when it combined operations with Queen of Heaven Cemetery.  The cemetery is currently 214 acres in size.  There are over 226,275 people buried at Mount Carmel, and about 800 people are interred annually at Mount Carmel.

The Bishop's Mausoleum is located at Mount Carmel Cemetery, which is the final resting places of the Bishops and Archbishops of Chicago.  Most recently, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin was buried here after his 1996 death.  Also on the cemetery grounds are the final resting places of a number of local organized crime figures, most notably Al Capone.  There are over 400 family mausoleums located on the cemetery grounds.

<doc id="2124828" title="Go West (band)" nonfiltered="85" processed="85" dbindex="450085">
Go West are an English pop duo.  
It was formed in 1982, by Peter Cox (born 17 November 1955, in Twickenham, London, England); and Richard Drummie (born 20 March 1959, in Twickenham, London, England).
Musical career.


Go West quickly had a publishing deal and possessed a portastudio, but lacked a band or recording company.  Cox and Drummie decided, with support from John Glover, their manager, to find a musical producer, and record just two of their songs. The tracks "We Close Our Eyes" and "Call Me" found Go West developing a record deal with Chrysalis Records.  The songwriting duo specialised in radio  friendly, white soul sounds.

The band's debut single, "We Close Our Eyes," was released in 1985 and managed to reach Number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, and # 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video for the song became an early favourite on MTV. This helped them to be voted the "Best Newcomers" at the 1986 BRIT Awards. The song was part of the soundtrack for the Italian low-budget horror film Demoni, also known as Demons. The single would prove to be their highest-placing UK single, and only appearance in the UK Top Ten.

Later in 1990, Go West scored a Top 10 U.S. hit with the song "King of Wishful Thinking" from the movie, Pretty Woman. An instrumental version of the song's chorus is also alleged to be heard in the production logo for Gracie Films (seen at the end of The Simpsons).

Trivia.
 Peter Cox was quickly brought in to replace Then Jerico's Mark Shaw on ITV reality TV show Reborn in the USA when Shaw stormed off the series in the first few days of the show's tour. Even though he had success as part of Go West, he was able to go on the show as none of his solo singles had found success in the United States. He was tipped to be one of the finalists, along with Tony Hadley from Spandau Ballet, until he forgot the words to the Norah Jones hit he was singing at the time.
 In February 2006 Drummie went on a charity trek to the summit of Mount Roraima with Spandau Ballet's Hadley and Martin Fry from ABC. He spent most of his free time shopping and whittling a six-foot long branch into the "Drummie" stick. ;
 Go West guitarist Alan Murphy later joined Level 42, and has been Kate Bush's session guitarist as well.
 Their song "Call Me" was featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, on Flash FM. It was also featured on the closing credits of an episode of the BBC One comedy, I'm Alan Partridge.
 One of their songs entitled, "One Way Street," was featured on the Rocky IV motion picture soundtrack in 1985.

The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) is the regional planning and intergovernmental coordination agency for the Atlanta, Georgia, region, as defined as a 10-county area including Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale counties, as well as the City of Atlanta.  It also serves as the Metropolitan Planning Organization for 19 counties in the Atlanta Region.

ARC and its predecessor agencies have coordinated the planning efforts in the region since 1947, when the first publicly-supported, multi-county planning agency in the United States was created. At that time, the Metropolitan Planning Commission (MPC) served DeKalb and Fulton counties and the City of Atlanta. Since then, ARC membership has grown to its current size of 10 counties and 63 municipalities.

The ARC is funded through a number of sources: local, state and federal government entities and private funds. 

Membership.
The Board membership of the commission includes: 1) each county commission chairman in the 10-county region; 2) one mayor from each county (except Fulton County); 3) one mayor from the northern half of Fulton County and one mayor from the southern half of Fulton County; 4) the mayor of the City of Atlanta; 5) one member of the Atlanta City Council; 6) fifteen private citizens, one from each of the 15 multi-jurisdictional districts of roughly equal population, elected by the 23 public officials; and 7) one member appointed by the Board of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.

Agency structure and functions.
The ARC is divided into numerous departments, covering a broad range of issues, from the region's growing senior population to region-wide transit issues to GIS data. The agency's structure and functions can be oulined as follows:

Office of the Director;
Communications: Communications Services, Community Involvement, Graphic Services, Information Center, Marketing, Media Relations, ARC Web site, MARC Youth Leadership Program (Model Atlanta Regional Commission);

Roger Sanchez (born on June 1, 1967, in Queens, New York) is a popular Dominican-American commercial house DJ who has scored many hits in the European and World Charts. 

He is considered by many to be "the DJ's DJ" for his innovative mixing techniques and his ability to connect with the crowd through his sets.

The eldest of two sons born to Angela Almonte and Hugo Sanchez, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Roger always pursued a career in music. Sanchez attended Pratt Institute working towards a degree in architecture, but took his father's advice to take a break from his studies to devote his full energy to DJing and see if he could make a career of it. Eventually he went on to spin at the largest nightclubs in New York City, and later around the world. Along with fellow New York deejays David Morales and Danny Tenaglia, Sanchez has become an icon of the European party scene, especially on the Spanish island of Ibiza, notoriously known worldwide for its hedonistic lifestyle and nightlife.

He later began remixing records for many artists including Michael Jackson, Babyface and many more. His mixes are played widely in dance clubs, with many of his tracks included in the sets of other House DJs.

In 2001, he released his first (production) album, First Contact, from which the single "Another Chance" was taken. It went on to become a major hit, entering the UK Singles Chart at #1. The song was based on a sample of the first verse of Toto's song "I Won't Hold You Back".

Sanchez also hosts a radio show called 'Release Yourself', with worldwide distribution. He has also released a series of compilation albums based on songs from this show. 

In 2004 Roger won his first Grammy Award for 'Best Remixed Recording' for his remix of No Doubt's "Hella Good".

Besides his career as a deejay, Sanchez is the owner of his own label, Stealth Records.

Star Académie is a Quebec reality TV series started in 2003, featuring an array of competing young women and men for the title of the best singer. It is the Québécois adaptation of the French television show Star Academy produced by Netherlands company Endemol, based in the Spanish format called Operación Triunfo.

Description.
It is aired for two months each year (February to April) on the TVA network. It is part of the reality television craze of the turn of the millennium. Hosted by Julie Snyder, the show is a competition to find the best young francophone singer, not only in Quebec, but also in french speaking regions of Canada, having auditions in Ontario (Eastern Ontario) and New Brunswick (l'Acadie). Then fourteen people (seven of each gender) are chosen to compete in front of the cameras.

It is separated in two simultaneous formats: each day during the week, a show presents moments of the life and training in the common house of the Académiciens and each weekend sees one Gala show where the contenders sing. At each of these Galas, some participants are put on the line and one is chosen to stay by the public and by the judging panel.

It proved to be immensely popular, drawing not only viewership, but genuine affection from the public for the young idealistic contenders. Pride also arises for the regions where the participants are from, like pride was felt by many from the Acadian people when Wilfred Le Bouthillier, from Acadia, was chosen for the competition and later crowned winner of the first, 2003 edition. 

It has also proved to be an effective springboard for the singing careers of some of its past participants, like 2003 finalists Wilfred Le Bouthillier, who recorded with the help of renowned Cajun singer Zachary Richard, and Marie-Élaine Thibert, who also released an album and sung for the soundtrack of Léa Pool's movie The Blue Butterfly.



Origins.
It is inspired by the French show Star Academy and is similar to the Pop Idol & American Idol phenomena. The name was francized for its Quebec adaptation because of the local importance given to the respect of the French language. However, it does create an grammatically impossible phrase in French. The proper translation would be Académie des stars, although this could be considered less catchy. Francization is typically given even more importance in Quebec French than in France itself (see Office québécois de la langue française).

A relatively small, but notable difference in the show format from its French counterpart is the selection process. Each week, the French version asks the public and judging panel to vote for which one, out of the contenders in danger, should be excluded from the show. The results are announced live, on stage, to the excluded member and the viewers. While this formula was followed in the beginning for Star Académie, it soon was changed because of protests, for the system was seen as cruel treatment to the excluded participant. On one early show, singer Daniel Boucher quit the studio halfway through the show because of this impression. Consequently, the public and judges are now asked to vote for the participant to remain at the Académie. The results are still announced live.

Criticism.
Star Académie drew criticism for the capitalist and vertical integration strategies of producing megacompany Quebecor to publicize the show and make it profitable. For example, each vote from the public costs one dollar, the website is in large part reserved to paying members and the Quebecor company, massive owner of many Quebec media, heavily promoted the show via TVA (its own television network), all of its magazines and newspapers like 7 Jours and Journal de Montréal. Astral Media's RockDétente also did a lot of heavy promoting themselves during the 2005 edition, as the official stations of Star Académie. Also were criticized the instant celebrity machine and supposed lack of artistic integrity aspects of the whole enterprise.

The Polled Hereford is a breed of cattle without horns.  It is a direct relative of the Hereford breed of cattle which derive their name from their place of origin, Hereford, a county located in west England. In fact, the breed is a genetic mutation that evolved into its own breed. Occasionally, Hereford cows would produce offspring which did not develop horns. As a result, the Polled Hereford breed was born. 

Warren Gammon, a young Iowa rancher capitalized on the idea of the Polled Hereford breed and started the Polled Hereford registry with eleven naturally hornless cattle. Today, the Polled Hereford and Hereford breed has been combined under the same American Hereford Association name.

The Polled Hereford breed is bred for its deep fore-quarters, depth and muscling, docile temperament, fast growing calves, and good quality of beef.

<doc id="1399926" title="List of incomplete Doctor Who serials" nonfiltered="95" processed="95" dbindex="450095">
This is a list of Doctor Who serials that no longer exist in any complete form in the BBC archives. They are incomplete due to the BBC's former policy of  holding only a limited archive of episodes, and wiping tapes belonging to shows that they didn't see a potential future market in. Many other shows, such as Dad's Army and The Wednesday Play have been similarly affected. 

For a more detailed discussion of this, see Doctor Who missing episodes. 

All missing episodes from the missing William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton stories exist in audio form (thanks to fans recording them live on original broadcast) and all the audio soundtracks will have been released by the end of 2006. Also many of the stories have "tele-snaps" taken during filming which exist. The BBC has made use of these tele-snaps by recreating some lost episodes with these pictures. They can be viewed here. 

Brief excerpts from many episodes exist, some lasting as short as one second in duration. This includes 8 mm film footage taken of the television screen, censor edits, and extracts featured on other programmes, most notably Blue Peter.

Incomplete serials starring the First Doctor  (William Hartnell).



Incomplete serials starring the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton).



Black and white only serials starring the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee).

While all Pertwee era stories are complete, a small number exist only in black and white instead of colour. However, three of these incomplete serials (Doctor Who and the Silurians, The Dæmons, and Terror of the Autons) were processed to merge the black and white film with off-air colour recordings by the Doctor Who Restoration Team for subsequent video release. Poor-quality off-air colour recordings of The Ambassadors of Death made from a US transmission in the 1970s exist, but the recordings are severely affected by a rainbow-coloured pattern of interference that at times overtakes the entire picture.

Although many attempts have been made to restore colour to the incomplete stories, the financial cost has proven prohibitive so far.

<doc id="234714" title="Medical imaging" nonfiltered="96" processed="96" dbindex="450096">
See also: Radiology, Radiography;

Medical imaging refers to the techniques and processes used to create images of the human body (or parts thereof) for clinical purposes (medical procedures seeking to reveal, diagnose or examine disease) or medical science (including the study of normal anatomy and function). As a discipline and in its widest sense, it is part of biological imaging and incorporates radiology (in the wider sense), radiological sciences, endoscopy, (medical) thermography, medical photography and microscopy (e.g. for human pathological investigations). Measurement and recording techniques which are not primarily designed to produce images, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and others, but which produce data susceptible to be represented as maps (i.e. containing positional information), can be seen as forms of medical imaging.

In the clinical context, medical imaging is generally equated to Radiology or "clinical imaging" and the medical practicer's responsible for interpreting (and sometimes acquiring) the images is a radiologist. Diagnostic radiography (see Radiography) designates the technical aspects of medical imaging and in particular the acquisition of medical images. The radiographer or radiologic technologist is usually responsible for acquiring medical images of diagnostic quality, although some radiological interventions are performed by radiologists.

As a field of scientific investigation, medical imaging constitutes a sub-discipline of biomedical engineering, medical physics or medicine depending on the context: Research and development in the area of instrumentation, image acquisition (e.g. radiography), modelling and quantification are usually the preserve of biomedical engineering, medical physics and computer science; Research into the application and interpretation of medical images is usually the preserve of radiology and the medical sub-discipline relevant to medical condition or area of medical science (neuroscience, cardiology, psychiatry, psychology, etc) under investigation. Many of the techniques developed for medical imaging also have scientific and industrial applications.

Medical imaging is often perceived to designate the set of techniques that produce images of the internal aspect of the body (without having to open it). In this restricted sense, medical imaging can be seen as the solution of mathematical inverse problems. This means that cause (the properties of living tissue) is inferred from effect (the observed signal). In the case of ultrasonography the probe consists of ultrasonic pressure waves and echoes inside the tissue show the internal structure. In the case of projection radiography, the probe is X-ray radiation which is absorbed at different rates in different tissue types such as bone, muscle and fat.

Modern imaging technology.
Fluoroscopy.


Fluoroscopy produces real-time images of internal structures of the body in a similar fashion to radiography, but employs a constant input of x rays. Contrast media, such as barium, iodine, and air are used to visualize internal organs as they work.
Fluoroscopy is also used in image-guided procedures when constant feedback during a procedure is required.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


A Magnetic Resonance Imaging instrument (MRI scanner) uses powerful magnets to polarise and excite hydrogen nuclei (single proton)) in water molecules in human tissue, producing a detectable signal which is spatially encoded resulting in images of the body. In brief, MRI involves the use of three kinds of electromagnetic field: a very strong (of the order of units of teslas) static magnetic field to polarize the hydrogen nuclei, called the static field; a weaker time-varying (of the order of 1 kHz) for spatial encoding, called the gradient field(s); and a weak radio-frequency (RF) field for manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei to produce measurable signals, collected through an RF antenna. Like CT, MRI traditionally creates a 2D image of a thin "slice" of the body and is therefore considered a tomographic imaging technique. Modern MRI instruments are capable of producing images in the form of 3D blocks, which may be considered a generalisation of the single-slice, tomographic, concept. Unlike CT, MRI does not involve the use of ionizing radiation and is therefore not associated with the same health hazards; for example there are no known long term effects of exposure to strong static fields (this is the subject of some debate; see 'Safety' in MRI) and therefore there is no limit on the number of scans to which an individual can be subjected, in contrast with X-ray and CT. However, there are well identified health risks associated with tissue heating from exposure to the RF field and the presence of implanted devices in the body, such as pace makers. These risks are strictly controlled as part of the design of the instrument and the scanning protocols used. CT and MRI being sensitive to different properties of the tissue, the appearance of the images obtained with the two techniques differ markedly. In CT, X-rays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image, therefore the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor. An MRI can ONLY "see" hydrogen based objects, so bone, which is calcium based, will be a void in the image, and will not affect soft tissue views. This makes it excellent for peering into the brain and joints.

MRI, or "NMR imaging" as it was originally known, has only been in use since the early 1980's. Effects from long term, or repeated exposure, to the intense static magnetic field are not known.

Nuclear medicine.



Images from gamma cameras are used in Nuclear Medicine to detect regions of biological activity that are often associated with diseases.  A short lived isotope, such as 131I is administered to the patient.  These isotopes are more readily absorbed by biologically active regions of the body, such as tumors or fracture points in bones.

Positron emission tomography (PET).



Positron emission tomography is used to detect certain brain diseases.  Similarly to nuclear medicine, a short-lived isotope, such as 18F, is incorporated into a substance used by the body such as glucose which is absorbed by the tumor of interest.  PET scans are often viewed along side computed tomography scans, which can be performed on the same equipment without moving the patient.  This allows the tumors detected by the PET scan to be viewed next to the rest of the patient's anatomy detected by the CT scan.

Projection radiography.

Radiographs, more commonly known as x-rays, are often used to determine the type and extent of a fracture as well as for detecting pathological changes in the lungs. With the use of radio-opaque contrast media, such as barium, they can also be used to visualize the structure of the stomach and intestines - this can help diagnose ulcers or certain types of colon cancer.

Tomography.
Tomography is the method of imaging a single plane, or slice, of an object resulting in a tomogram. There are several forms of tomography:

Linear tomography: This is the most basic form of tomography. The X-ray tube moved from point "A" to point "B" above the patient, while the cassette holder (or "bucky") moves simultaneously under the patient from point "B" to point "A." The fulcrum, or pivot point, is set to the area of interest. In this manner, the points above and below the focal plane are blurred out, just as the background is blurred when panning a camera during exposure. No longer carried out and replaced by computed tomography.

Poly tomography: This was a complex form of tomography. With this technique, a number of geometrical movements were programmed, such as hypocycloidic, circular, figure 8, and elliptical. Philips Medical Systems  produced one such device called the 'Polytome.' No longer carried out, replaced by computed tomography.

Zonography: This is a variant of linear tomography, where a limited arc of movement is used. It is still used in some centres for visualising the kidney during an intravenous urogram (IVU)

Orthopantomography (OPT): The only common tomographic examination in use. This makes use of a complex movement to allow the radiographic examination of the mandible, as if it were a flat bone. It is often referred to as a "Panaray", but this is incorrect, as it is a trademark of a specific company's equipment

Computed tomography (CAT or CT): (Main article: computed tomography): A CT scan, also known as a CAT scan (Computed Axial Tomography scan), is a helical tomography (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D image of the structures in a thin section of the body. It uses X-rays. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography, repeated scans should be limited.

Ultrasound.


Medical ultrasonography uses high frequency sound waves of between 2.0 to 10.0 megahertz that are reflected by tissue to varying degrees to produce a 2D image, traditionally on a TV monitor. This is often used to visualize the fetus in pregnant women. Other important uses include imaging the abdominal organs, heart, male genitalia, and the veins of the leg. While it may provide less anatomical information than techniques such as CT or MRI, it has several advantages which make it ideal as a first line test in numerous situations, in particular that it studies the function of moving structures in real-time. It is also very safe to use, as the patient is not exposed to radiation and the ultrasound does not appear to cause any adverse effects, although information on this is not well documented. It is also relatively cheap and quick to perform. Ultrasound scanners can be taken to critically ill patients in intensive care units, avoiding the danger caused while moving the patient to the radiology department. The real time moving image obtained can be used to guide drainage and biopsy procedures. Doppler capabilities on modern scanners allow the blood flow in arteries and veins to be assessed.

Clinical imaging or biological imaging techniques.
Electron microscopy.

The electron microscope is a microscope that can magnify very small details with high resolving power due to the use of electrons as the source of illumination, magnifying at levels up to 2,000,000 times.

Electron microscopy is employed in anatomic pathology to identify organelles within the cells. Its usefulness has been greatly reduced by immunhistochemistry but it is still irreplaceable for the diagnosis of kidney disease, identification of immotile cilia syndrome and many other tasks

Creation of three-dimensional images.
Recently, techniques have been developed to enable CT, MRI and ultrasound scanning software to produce 3D images for the physician. Traditionally CT and MRI scans produced 2D static output on film. To produce 3D images, many scans are made, then combined by computers to produce a 3D model, which can then be manipulated by the physician. 3D ultrasounds are produced using a somewhat similar technique.

With the ability to visualize important structures in great detail, 3D visualization methods are a valuable resource for the diagnosis and surgical treatment of many pathologies. It was a key resource (and also the cause of failure) for the famous, but ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Singaporean surgeons to separate Iranian twins Ladan and Laleh Bijani in 2003. The 3D equipment was used previously for similar operations with great success.

Other proposed or developed techniques include:

diffuse optical tomography;
elastography;
electrical impedance tomography;
optoacoustic imaging;
ophthalmology;
A-scan;
B-scan;
corneal topography;
Heidelberg retinal tomography;
optical coherence tomography;
scanning laser ophthalmoscopy;

Some of these techniques are still at a research stage and not yet used in clinical routines.

Non-diagnostic imaging.
Neuroimaging has also been used in experimental circumstances to allow people (especially disabled persons) to control outside devices, acting as a brain computer interface.

Medical imaging service.
 This is a specialized area of medical equipment service and repair, which is separate from the biomedical field, although a hospital with their own service group may include them in the biomed department.

At one time, there were only two ways to receive training for this field. One was to learn it in the military, and the other was on-the-job training (OJT) from the manufacturer. But since the 1980's several independent training centers have been started. One such school is RSTI .

There are different means of employment in this occupation. Working for the manufacturer's field service department (OEM), working for a hospital (in-house), and working for an independent (outside, or independent provider). The most stable positions are with the OEM or hospital, as you can remain current through on-going training, and the two have good working relationships.

The OEM service engineer can expect to spend a lot of time driving from one site to another during the work day, and working non-standard hours. They will install, remove, diagnose, repair, calibrate, perform preventive maintenance, and interface equipment, all while ensuring good customer relations. You may also be required to do yearly testing of the radiation sources for Federal  and State compliance.

The in-house person is employed by the hospital. With larger medical facilities, travel between the hospitals' other locations may be required to perform the required services. You may also be required to do yearly testing of the radiation sources for compliance. The OEM or independent will provide installation of purchased equipment, and can be used for back-up service.

An independent is typically someone who has left an OEM, and started their own service business. Staying up-to-date as an independent can be difficult and expensive, as the OEM is usually reluctant to provide training. However, non-OEM training facilities are available, such as the aforementioned RSTI. Competition for service can be aggressive, with OEM's giving hospitals or clinics a reduction in equipment purchase price if they retain some form of OEM service.

The independent may also sell and install refurbished equipment, or de-install equipment. They will repair, calibrate, and perform preventative maintenance. Because many of the tasks associated with imaging service require expensive, specialized equipment, there may be a financial limit to the independent. Typical equipment used routinely are a Storage Oscilloscope and multimeter (if servicing old vacuum-state equipment, a VOM would be helpful). Additional equipment: Keithley dosimeter, mAs meter, Biddle contact tachometer, light to radiation template, etc.

Nafka Mina (aramaic:          ) is a Talmudic term which means practical difference. It is often used in the phrase Mai nafka mina?(             ), which means "What is the practical (or most important) difference?"

It literally means "goes out from it" - indicating that in a distinction between conceptual categories, there must be some practical effect that emerges from the distinct categories as conceived.

Louis Joseph Seutin (1793-February 6, 1862) was a Belgian doctor and surgeon.

Born in Nivelles, he studied medicine and took part in the Battle of Waterloo as a doctor. After the Independence of Belgium in 1830, he became the personal doctor of king Leopold I and Head Doctor of the Belgian army. He was later made a baron for his services. He became a senator in 1853. 

He invented the use of starched bandages and, in 1848, was the first to use chloroform for anaesthesia. His treatment of open fractures was revolutionary. By improving hygiene, he also drastically reduced the number of women who died in childbirth.

He died in Brussels.

The Song to General Kim Jong-il is a marching song from North Korea. The song praises its current leader, Kim Jong-il, as a part of his cult of personality. During the Presidency of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il helped to run his father's own personal cult, composing songs and writing books. One such famous song was Song of General Kim Il-sung, which is usually played wherever possible. At the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, now the leader of North Korea, had his own cult. Although the Song to General Kim Jong-il is not as widely popular as the Song of General Kim Il-sung (nor was his cult as large as his father's), it is also played regularly in North Korea.

The 20th Annual Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (generally known as ARIA Music Awards or simply The ARIAS) were held on October 29, 2006 at the Acer Arena at the Sydney Olympic Park complex, thus continuing the previous year's innovation of televising the awards on Sunday evening. Presenters on the night included James Mathison, Johnny Knoxville,  Jesse McCartney and John Mayer.

Axle Whitehead controversy.
While Video Hits host Axle Whitehead and Nova 96.9 radio personality Jabba were presenting the awards for highest selling single and album, Whitehead exposed his penis in front of an audience of up to 10,000. Whitehead also simulated masturbation on the ARIA trophy as the winners made their way to the stage. He announced three days after the awards that he had resigned from Network Ten. The incident was removed from the telecast of the awards.

<doc id="5643103" title="Ferroq" nonfiltered="108" processed="108" dbindex="450108">
 
Ferroq is a fictional character from the The Legend of Zorro. He was played by Raul Mendez. Ferroq had served as a butler and a loyal henchman for Count Armand. For the most part he was a very silent man who only spoke when necessary, and was always ready for a fight, armed with a switchblade of unique design: two elegant, overlapping crescent blades, sharp enough to gut a man with ease. According to the "Legend of Zorro Movie Novelization" (by Scott Ciencin), he is quite a sick character who quote: "has the desire to "take one's blade and unzip another person from throat to groin" (referring to Elena de la Vega, Alejandro/Zorro's wife). Ferroq serves Count Armand for, when young, he was attacked by a group of three knife-weilding thugs, and the Count, also young at the time, had interveined and risked a stabbing to save Ferroq's life. Armand had given him the choice to either: a) work for him, serve him, be ever-faithful to him (as it turns out his family had for generations, and that's the only reason the Count jumped into the fight) or, b) live a life on the filthy streets of back-alley Paris. Armand believed Ferroq was forever destined to call him "master", because, after looking back into the de la Fere history books, he found references to Ferroq's ancestors and had spent much effort trying to find him.

 Story .

Unlike Count Armand, Ferroq spent most of his time lurking behind the scenes, but he would attend to his master's every whim when needed. Wherever Armand went, Ferroq wasn't very far behind. To most, he was just a simple butler. But in the eyes of the De la Vegas, he was a deadly assasin. After Elena's true identity was discovered, Ferroq made sure that all possible means of escape were covered. He is the one who actually uncovered the plot, by following the pidgeon Elena sent to the Pinkertons. Killing the pidgeon and bringing the bodies of the Pinkertons back to prove his point, he convinced Armand of his near-fatal error and plotted to trap Alejandro's ex-wife. He then escorted her onto Armand's train, while Jacob MicGivens took care of Zorro. When Zorro escaped death and boarded the train as well, Armand gave Ferroq the command to kill Elena and her son while he took care of the intruder.

 Prevention .

Ferroq pursued Elena and her son to the end of the train, but Zorro's son managed to escape with Elena's help. Elena then went back into the train only to face Ferroq. There was a fierce fight inside that one car. Elena managed to keep herself clear of Ferroq's switchblade. She even managed to knock it out of his hand for a moment. Ferroq acted swiftly after Elena disarmed him. He pulled a metal chain with a spike ball out of his coat pocket, and then tried to kill her with that instead. After Ferroq recovered his deadly switchblade, Elena got the upperhand. She took a bottle of Nitroglycerine and held it in front of her. Ferroq did not attempt to run her through because of this. She then kicked him in the chest, stuffed the bottle into his pants, and knocked him out of the train. Ferroq landed in a circle of Confederate troops, who were going to transport the Nitro to the east, and all of them blew up in a violent explosion that shook the entire desert.

Posh Boy Records was a Hollywood, California based record label owned by Robbie Fields, a sometime high school substitute teacher who took an interest in the emerging punk rock scene in Orange County, California during the early 1980s. Its releases enjoyed substantial airplay on Rodney Bingenheimer's show on KROQ, and some of its releases,  notably the Robbie Fields produced version of Amoeba by The Adolesecents and the synth rock classic Are You Ready For The Sex Girls performed by Sparks offshoot Gleaming Spires and produced by Stephen Hague, made it into regular programming on the station. Among many bands whose first recordings were issued by the label was Social Distortion.  The label continued releasing records into the 21st century, the last known release being a 7" release by yet another Orange County, California group 
The Willowz.  Its most successful release is commonly agreed to be Agent Orange's debut Living In Darkness, containing the extreme sports anthem Bloodstains, a song covered by many alternative groups, the most notable being The Offspring for the Ready To Rumble film soundtrack.

<doc id="1424181" title="British Columbia general election, 1903" nonfiltered="111" processed="111" dbindex="450111">
The British Columbia general election of 1903 was the tenth general election for the Province of British Columbia, Canada. It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on September 5 1903, and held on October 3 1903. The new legislature met for the first time on November 26 1903.

This was the first election in British Columbia that was fought by political parties. Prior to this election, British Columbia politics were non-partisan.

The first election was dominated by the Conservative and Liberal parties, which were affiliated with existing parties at the federal level. See Conservative Party of Canada and Liberal Party of Canada.

The Conservative Party won over 46.4% of the popular vote and a slim majority of the seats in the legislature.

Results by party.



Notes:

* Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election.

1 The Conservative Party and the Liberal Party each elected one candidate by acclamation.

2 There was no provincial "Labour Party" as such. Each of the three Electoral Districts with a Labour candidate (Nanaimo, Slocan, and Vancouver City) had a local, autonomous Labour Party. As well, some Liberal candidates appear to have run on a "Liberal-Labour" platform (Atlin, Victoria and Ymir).

Results by riding.

Rohit Loomba is a hip hop journalist based in Chicago, IL. Rohit founded Chinatown Productions with his partner, Mike Li, in 2004. Chinatown Productions has since become the entertainment company through which both Rohit and Mike have launched various hip hop oriented projects. Rohit is currently Editor-In-Chief of Bumsquad Magazine (the official magazine of the popular hip hop DJ Crew, the Bumsquad DJz), staff at the heavily trafficked ezine allhiphop, contributing editor for WWS Magazine, and a writer for Ozone Magazine. 

Bumsquad Magazine.
Rohit has interviewed artists such as Paul Wall, Chamillionaire, Papoose, Mobb Deep, Juelz Santana, and Ludacris for Bumsquad Magazine which he founded in association with the Bumsquad DJz. The debut issue of Bumsquad Magazine found Papoose and Chamillionaire on the covers. In an online interview Rohit briefly mentioned that his harsh criticism of Papoose in the debut issue triggered a less than pleasant response from DJ Kay Slay who works closely with the New York emcee. It was made clear that words were exchanged but the extent of the dispute wasn't mentioned further.

Allhiphop.
Rohit is also staff at Allhiphop.com for which he has interviewed Shawnna, Paul Wall, Trae, and others. In his allhiphop feature on Paul Wall, the popular Houston emcee and Jeweler discussed his trip to Sierra Leone in great detail, commenting on the realities of the diamond trade and the issues surrounding conflict diamonds. The feature was given much attention by fans while some felt that the emcee displayed hypocrisy by continuing to sell and wear diamonds even despite having seen what he described. In his interview with Scarface, Rohit found the legendary southern emcee discussing his exploration of the Islamic Faith as well as the importance of keeping your business straight.

<doc id="3307571" title="Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge" nonfiltered="113" processed="113" dbindex="450113">

Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge is located in the U.S. state of Montana. Bowdoin NWR was established in 1936 as a migratory bird refuge.  It is located in the short and mixed grass prairie region of North-central Montana and encompasses 15,551 acres.  The Refuge lies about 7 miles northeast of Malta in the Milk River Valley of Phillips County.  Managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bowdoin is one of over 540 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System - a system of lands set aside to conserve wildlife and habitat and as a place for people to enjoy today and for generations to come.  

Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge's primary purpose is to preserve and enhance resting, feeding, and breeding habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife.  The Refuge attracts migrating waterfowl and shorebirds by the thousands and provides breeding and nesting habitat for ducks, geese, grassland songbirds, and colonial nesting water birds.  The area is equally important to a variety of resident wildlife, including raptors, white-tailed deer, pronghorn antelope, sharp-tailed grouse, and coyotes.  Threatened species using the Refuge include the bald eagle and piping plover and on occasion peregrine falcons.

North-central Montana is made up of many depressional wetlands created by glaciers 12,000 years ago.  Although geologic history indicates that Lake Bowdoin was once an oxbow of the pre-glacial Missouri River channel, today the Missouri River lies nearly 70 miles south of Bowdoin NWR.  Major habitat types on the Refuge include saline and freshwater wetlands, native prairie, planted dense nesting cover and shrubs.  Refuge wetlands total 7,226 acres with the remaining habitat consisting of uplands.

Chuck Forsberg's fame comes in part from developing the YMODEM and ZMODEM file transfer protocols. ZMODEM is a file transfer protocol with error checking and crash recovery.  ZMODEM does not wait for positive acknowledgment after each block is sent, but rather sends blocks in rapid succession. If a ZMODEM transfer is cancelled or interrupted for any reason, the transfer can be resurrected later and the previously transferred information need not be resent.

Chuck Forsberg designed YMODEM as a file transfer protocol for use between modems and developed it as the successor to XMODEM and MODEM7, It was formally given the name "YMODEM" (Yet another Modem implementation) in 1985 by Ward Christensen.

Other biographical information.
Chuck Forsberg graduated from Western Military Academy in 1962. Forsberg founded the company Omen Technology, which specializes in data transfer software, in 1984. He is an amateur radio operator (call sign WA7KGX),and a licensed aircraft pilot. He currently resides in Portland Oregon.

Limp Wrist is an all-gay straight edge punk rock band (Gayedge) featuring members of Los Crudos, Hail Mary, Devoid of Faith and Kill the Man Who Questions.

Referring to their style of hardcore punk music, the band declared in Frontiers newsmagazine, "We put the  core  back in Queercore". Their first recording was the self released demo Don't Knock It Till You Try It. This was followed by a single called "What s Up With The Kids" and then the self-titled LP Limp Wrist. However, since band members lived in different states maintaining the group became difficult. After an interlude they resumed touring in 2004 and released a new CD, Complete Discography the same year. The song "Ode" from this recording pays tribute to pioneering gay hardcore musicians Gary Floyd of The Dicks, Randy Turner of Big Boys and Joshua Plague of Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live, providing a historical context for Limp Wrist.

The band s best known song was "I Love Hardcore Boys, I Love Boys Hardcore", which received much attention from fans and press alike. Lead singer Martin Sorrondeguy appears in Queercore: A Punk-u-mentary by Scott Treleaven and addresses the issue implicit in these song titles.

In 2002, Maximum RockNRoll featured Martin Sorrondeguy in its "QueerPunk" issue, in discussion with Gary Fembot and Iraya Robles of Sta-Prest, and Aaron Detroit of The Little Deaths.

In 2004 Sorrondeguy released his own documentary film, Beyond The Screams: A U.S. Latino Hardcore Punk Documentary. He had begun the film while still a member of his former band Los Crudos.

In 2006, Limp Wrist released the split label 7", "Want Us Dead" on Cheap Art/Lengua Armada.

Paisean Faisean is an Irish language dating show broadcast on TG4, presented by Aoife Ní Thuairisg. The format of the show involves three men choosing outfits for one woman, who must then base her choice on which outfit she likes the best. The suitors are shown a short pre-recorded clip of the girl, in which she introduces herself. Each man shops in a different shop, and has ¤400 spending money. The winning man and the girl then share dinner in a restaurant.

The show is currently in its second season, and has raised some controversy over its advertisements, two of which have had similar complaints upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland - a billboard advertisement depicting a woman in slightly revealing clothing, led to complaints of 'reducing women to mere sexual objects', and a radio advertisement in which a woman complains about people being able to see her underwear, with the response of 'Not if you're not wearing any, they won't', led to complaints about sexual equality.

Notably, the show is promoted heavily through the English language, despite being in Irish.

The Commission for the Preservation of Pioneer Jewish Cemeteries and Landmarks of the Judah L. Magnes Museum, in Berkeley, California holds title to six pioneer Jewish Cemeteries in California Gold Rush/Mother Lode country. The cemeteries at Jackson, Mokelumne Hill, Sonora, Grass Valley, Nevada City, and Placerville mark the beginning of Jewish settlement in Northern California. Following tradition, the Jewish pioneers founded burial societies as their first united action; the cemeteries are today's major link to the vanished Jewish communities of the Mother Lode.

Those interested in learning more of the history of the cemeteries, their inhabitants, and/or visiting the cemeteries are advised to examine San Morris's book, A Traveler's Guide to Pioneer Jewish Cemeteries of the California Gold Rush (Berkeley, California: Commission for the Preservation of Pioneer Jewish Cemeteries and Landmarks, Judah L. Magnes Museum, 1996 (ISBN 0-943376-63-7)). It is recommended that would-be visitors contact the Judah L. Magnes Museum before any visit, as many of the cemeteries are closed/locked and may not be visited without making previous arrangements to gain entrance.

The Western Jewish History Center, of the Judah L. Magnes Museum contains a large collection of records and documents relating to the Commission's work and includes correspondence; minutes of meetings; reports; newspaper clippings; and photographs of the cemeteries.

John Theodore Cuthbert Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara, GBE, MC (8 February 1884   17 May 1964) was a London born English aviation pioneer and Conservative Party politician.

He learned to fly in 1908 in France in a Voisin biplane.  On October 30 1909, flying a Short Brothers aircraft, he flew a circular mile and won a 1,000 pound prize offered by the Daily Mail newspaper. On November 4 1909 he made the first live cargo flight by airplane when he put a small pig in a waste-paper basket tied to a wing-strut of his airplane.  With Charles Rolls he would later make the first ascent in a spherical balloon made in England by the Short brothers.

On March 8 1910 Moore-Brabazon became the first person to qualify as a pilot in the United Kingdom and was awarded Royal Aero Club certificate number 1, his car also bore the number-plate FLY 1.  During the First World War he served in the Royal Flying Corps, attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was awarded the Military Cross.  He was instrumental in the development of military aerial photography.

Moore-Brabazon later became a Conservative Member of Parliament for Chatham (1918-1929) and Wallasey (1931-1942) and served as a junior minister in the 1920s, then Minister of Transport and Minister of Aircraft Production in Winston Churchill's wartime government.  

Moore-Brabazon was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Brabazon of Tara in 1942. In 1943 he chaired the Brabazon Committee which planned to develop the post-war British aircraft industry.  He was involved in the production of the Bristol Brabazon, a giant airliner that first flew on September 4 1949. It was then and still is (as of 2004) the largest aeroplane built in Britain.

A keen golfer, Moore-Brabazon was captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, the governing body of golf, from 1952-1953. At the age of 70 he was still riding the Cresta Run.

Paul Andrew Strang (born Bulawayo, July 28 1970) was a leg-spinning all-rounder who played in 24 Tests and 95 ODIs for Zimbabwe  between 1994 and 2001. He played Test cricket alongside his brother, Bryan Strang; their father, Bryan Strang, was a first-class umpire and was TV umpire for two of Zimbabwe's Test matches in 1994/5.

He studied at the University of Cape Town, and toured Pakistan with the Zimbabwe side in 1993/4.  He played his first Test in 1994, and became a professional cricketer in 1995.  He was one of the leading wicket-takers in the 1996 Cricket World Cup in India, taking taking 12 wickets with a bowling average of 16, although the team was knocked out in the preliminary stage, beating Kenya (with Strang taking 5 wickets) but losing its other 4 matches. 

His scored his only Test century in the 1st innings of the 1st Test against Pakistan at Sheikhupura in 1996-7, batting at #8, including a stand of 87 with his brother for the 9th wicket.  He also took 5 wickets in Pakistan's 1st innings in the same match.  Strang's achievement was overshadowed by a double century, 257 not out, scored by Wasim Akram, and the match was drawn. 

He played two season of county cricket, as the overseas player for Kent in 1997 and for Nottinghamshire in 1998. 

He played in the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England in 2000, when Zimbabwe beat Kenya, India and South Africa to qualify for the "Super Six" stage.  He obtained his best Test bowling figures of 8-109 in the 1st innings against New Zealand at Bulawayo in 2000-1, although Zimbabwe lost the match by 7 wickets.  This remains the best bowling figures recorded by a Zimbabwean in an innings in Test cricket (the best match figures belong to Adam Huckle).   He only played in three further Tests, with his international career curtailed by a chronic injury to the muscles of his right hand in 2000.

<doc id="309810" title="Kingdom of Thessalonica" nonfiltered="125" processed="125" dbindex="450125">
The Kingdom of Thessalonica was a short-lived Crusader State founded after the Fourth Crusade.

Boniface of Montferrat, the leader of the crusade, was expected by both the Crusaders and Byzantines to become the new emperor after the conquest of Constantinople in 1204. However, the Venetians felt Boniface was too closely tied to the Byzantine Empire, as his brother Conrad had married into the Byzantine royal family. The Venetians wanted an emperor whom they could control more easily, and elected Baldwin of Flanders emperor of the new Latin Empire.

Boniface reluctantly accepted this, and set out to conquer Thessalonica, the second-largest Byzantine city after Constantinople. At first he had to compete with Emperor Baldwin, who also wanted the city, but Boniface won this dispute by handing over his territory on Crete to the Venetians. He then went on to capture the city later in 1204 and set up a kingdom there, subordinate to Baldwin, although the title of "king" was never officially used. Late 13th and 14th century sources suggest that Boniface based his claim to Thessalonica on the statement that his younger brother Renier had been granted Thessalonica on his marriage to Maria Komnene in 1180. 

The kingdom occupied land along the Aegean coast of Thrace, Thessaly, and Macedonia, but the interior borders were undefined as the  kingdom was constantly at war with the Bulgarians, who wanted to capture the remnants of the Byzantine Empire for themselves, and the Despotate of Epirus, one of the Byzantine states-in-exile trying to reconquer Constantinople. The kingdom also faced attacks from the deposed Byzantine emperor Alexius III, who had fled to Corinth, although he was quickly defeated. After this victory Boniface captured the island of Euboea and helped some other Crusaders establish the Duchy of Athens and the Principality of Achaea, which became vassal states of Thessalonica. 

Boniface's rule lasted less than two years before he was ambushed by Kaloyan of Bulgaria and killed on September 4, 1207. The kingdom passed to Boniface's son Demetrius, who was still a baby, so actual power was held by various minor nobles. These nobles immediately rebelled against the Latin Empire, but they were crushed by Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209. Henry's brother Eustache then became regent for Demetrius. Taking advantage of this situation, Michael I of Epirus, a former ally of Boniface, attacked the kingdom in 1210, as did the Bulgarians. Henry of Flanders eventually defeated both. Michael's brother Theodore continued the assault on the kingdom after Michael's death in 1215. Over the next nine years Theodore gradually conquered all of Thessalonica except the city itself, as the Latin Empire could spare no army to defend it while they were busy fighting the more powerful Byzantine Empire of Nicaea. In 1224, just as Demetrius had become old enough to take power for himself, Theodore finally captured Thessalonica and the kingdom became part of the Despotate of Epirus.

The kingdom was claimed by titular kings of the house of Montferrat until 1284 and also by the Dukes of Burgundy; Baldwin II of Constantinople had promised the title to Hugh IV should he regain the Latin Empire.

Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet (November 1 1751   April 26 1816), English author, was born at Dunster Park, Berkshire, son of Bishop Croft of Stifford, Essex.

He matriculated at University College, Oxford, in March 1771, and was subsequently entered at Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar, but in 1782 returned to Oxford with a view to preparing for holy orders. In 1786 he received the vicarage of Prittlewell, Essex, but he remained at Oxford for some years accumulating materials for a proposed English dictionary. He was twice married, and on the day after his second wedding day he was imprisoned at Exeter for debt.

He then retired to Hamburg, and two years later his library was sold. He had succeeded in 1797 to the baronetcy, but not to the estates, of a distant cousin, Sir John Croft, 4th Baronet. He returned to England in 1800, but went abroad once more in 1802. He lived near Amiens at a house owned by Lady Mary Hamilton, said to have been a daughter of the earl of Leven and Melville. Later he removed to Paris, where he died on the 26th of April 1816.

In some of his numerous literary enterprises he had the help of Charles Nodier. Croft wrote the Life of Edward Young inserted in Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets.

In 1780 he published Love and Madness, a Story too true, in a series of letters between Parties whose names could perhaps be mentioned were they less known or less lamented. This book, which passed through seven editions, narrates the passion of a clergyman named James Hackman for Martha Ray, mistress of the earl of Sandwich, who was shot by her lover as she was leaving Covent Garden in 1779 (see the Case and Memoirs of the late Rev. Mr James Hackman, 1779).

Love and Madness has permanent interest because Croft inserted, among other miscellaneous matter, information about Thomas Chatterton gained from letters which he obtained from the poet's sister, Mrs Newton, under false pretences, and used without payment. Robert Southey, when about to publish an edition of Chatterton's works for the benefit of his family, published (November 1799) details of Croft's proceedings in the Monthly To this attack Croft wrote a reply addressed to John Nichols in the Gentleman's Magazine, and afterwards printed separately as Chatterton and Love and Madness ... (1800).

This tract evades the main accusation, and contains much abuse of Southey. Croft, however, supplied the material for the exhaustive account of Chatterton in Andrew Kippis's Biographia Britannica (vol. iv., 1789).

In 1788 he addressed a letter to William Pitt on the subject of a new dictionary. He criticized Samuel Johnson's efforts, and in 1790 he claimed to have collected 11,000 words used by excellent authorities but omitted by Johnson. Two years later he issued proposals for a revised edition of Johnson's Dictionary, but subscribers were lacking and his 200 vols. of manuscript remained unused. Croft was a good scholar and linguist, and the author of some curious books in French.

The Love Letters of Mr H. and Miss R. 1775-1779 were edited from Croft's book by Mr Gilbert Burgess (1895). See also John Nichols's Illustrations ... (1828), v. 202-218.

<doc id="428085" title="Electrospray ionization" nonfiltered="127" processed="127" dbindex="450127">


Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions. It is especially useful in producing ions from macromolecules because it overcomes the propensity of these molecules to fragment when ionized. The invention of electrospray ionization was rewarded with the attribution of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to John Fenn in 2002.

How it works.

In electrospray ionization a liquid is pushed through a very small charged, usually metal, capillary.  This liquid contains the substance which is to be studied, the analyte, dissolved in a large amount of solvent, which is usually much more volatile than the analyte. Volatile acids, bases or buffers are often added to this solution as well. The analyte exists as an ion in solution either in a protonated form or as an anion.  As like charges repel, the liquid pushes itself out of the capillary and forms a mist or an aerosol of small droplets about 10m across. This jet of aerosol droplets is at least partially produced by a process involving the formation of a Taylor cone and a jet from the tip of this cone.  A neutral carrier gas, such as nitrogen gas, is sometimes used to help nebulize the liquid and to help evaporate the neutral solvent in the small droplets.  As the small droplets evaporate, suspended in the air, the charged analyte molecules are forced closer together.  The drops become unstable as the similarly charged molecules come closer together and the droplets once again break up. This is referred to as Coulombic fission because it is the repulsive Coulombic forces between charged analyte molecules that drive it. This process repeats itself until the analyte is free of solvent and is a lone ion. There remains debate as to the exact mechanisms of electrospray processes particularly in the later part of the process as the lone ion is formed. The lone ion then continues along to the mass analyzer of a mass spectrometer.

In electrospray processes the ions observed are quasimolecular ions that are ionized by the addition of a proton (hydrogen ion) to give  (M=analyte molecule, H=hydrogen ion), or other cation such as sodium ion , or the removal of a proton  for example. In electrospray multiply charged ions such as  are often observed. For large macromolecules there will often be a distribution of many charge states and the charge on the ions can be great such as . Note that these are all even-electron species. Electrons themselves (alone) have neither been added or removed as with some other ionizations. The formation of ions in electrospray is somewhat homologous to acid-base reactions. Redox reactions do occur and a circuit with measurable current flow exists but atomic and molecular ions are the primary carriers of charge in the solution and gas phases.

Issues of debate.

There are two major competing theories about the final production of lone ions, the charged residue model (CRM) and the ion evaporation model (IEM). 
Electrospray droplets start off highly charged, and as they shrink through evaporation the Coulomb repulsion forces approach the force of surface tension that holds droplet together. The droplet then becomes unstable and disintegrates into several droplets of smaller radius. The Charged Residue Model suggests that electrospray droplets undergo evaporation and disintegration cycles, with each initial droplet leading to a multitude of much smaller "daughter" droplets. Each final "daughter" droplet contains on average one or less molecule of analyte. When the last solvent molecules evaporate from such droplet the analyte molecule is left with the charges that the droplet carried.
The Ion Evaporation (Desorption) Model suggests that as droplet reaches certain radius the field strength at the surface of the droplet becomes great enough to push or desorb ions directly out of the droplet. Characteristically, the fission event corresponds to an almost negligible loss in droplet mass, but a significant drop in charge.
It has been suggested that both models probably occur for different analytes/solvents and in the limit of both models they have a tendency to converge. That is to say that the distinction between a droplet containing an analyte molecule and an analyte molecule surrounded by a layer of solvent eventually disappears and coulombic fission looks a lot like ion evaporation. The real question is scale and timing and the techniques to definitively determine this are not available.

The use of the word "ionization" in "electrospray ionization" is criticized by some because many of the ions observed are thought to be preformed in solution before the electrospray process or created by simple changes in concentrations as the aerosolized droplets shrink. It is argued that electrospray is simply an interface for transferring ions from the solution phase to the gas phase.

Variants.

There exist many variations on the basic electrospray technique. Two important ones are microspray (µ-spray) and nanospray. The primary difference is in the reduced flow rate of the analyte containing liquid; however many other differences, such as the reduced internal diameter of the tubing or lack of nebulization gas, exist because of the difference in flow rate. These variants are important because they generally offer better sensitivity over traditional electrospray. The µ and nano designations refer to the flow rate of the analyte containing liquid; µLiters/minute and nanoLiters/minute respectively.

Applications.

Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.
 see also the main article on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;
Electrospray ionization is the primary ion source used in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry because it's a liquid-gas interface that is capable of coupling liquid chomatography with mass spectrometry.

Noncovalent gas phase interactions.
Electrospray ionization is also ideal in studying noncovalent gas phase interactions. The electrospray process is capable of transferring liquid-phase noncovalent complexes into the gas phase without disrupting the noncovalent interaction. This means that a cluster of two molecules can be studied in the gas phase by other mass spectrometry techniques. An interesting example of this is studying the interactions between enzymes and drugs which are inhibitors of the enzyme. Because inhibitors generally work by noncovalently binding to its target enzyme with reasonable affinity the noncovalent complex can be studied in this way. Competition studies have been done in this way to screen for potential new drug candidates.

Colloid thrusters.
Electrospray techniques are employed in the control of satellites by allowing precise and effective thrusts. Here the method's property of fine-controllable particle ejection is put to use.

Deposition of particles for nanostructures.
In nanotechnology the electrospray method may be employed to deposit single particles on surfaces. This is accomplished by spraying colloids and making sure that on average there is not more than one particle per droplet. Consequent drying of the surrounding solvent results in an aerosol stream of single particles of the desired type. Here the ionizing property of the process is not crucial for the application but may be put to use in electrostatic precipitation of the particles.

The Limehouse Declaration was a statement issued on January 25 1981 by four senior British Labour politicians, all MPs or former MPs: Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams. In this document the so-called "Gang of Four"  signalled their intent to leave the Labour Party and form a "Council for Social Democracy". This Council became the basis for the British Social Democratic Party (SDP).

The statement became known as the "Limehouse Declaration" as it was made from David Owen's London home in Limehouse. A transcript of it is given below.

----
Statement issued by Shirley Williams, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Roy Jenkins to the Press Association on 25 January 1981:
----


The calamitous outcome of the Labour Party Wembley conference demands a new start in British politics. A handful of trade union leaders can now dictate the choice of a future Prime Minister.

The conference disaster is the culmination of a long process by which the Labour Party has moved steadily away from its roots in the people of this country and its commitment to parliamentary government.

We propose to set up a Council for Social Democracy. Our intention is to rally all those who are committed to the values, principles and policies of social democracy.

We seek to reverse Britain's economic decline. We want to create an open, classless and more equal society, one which rejects ugly prejudices based upon sex, race or religion.

A first list of those who have agreed to support the Council will be announced at an early date. Some of them have been actively and continuously engaged in Labour politics. A few were so engaged in the past, but have ceased to be so recently. Others have been mainly active in spheres outside party politics.

We do not believe the fight for the ideals we share and for the recovery of our country should be limited only to politicians. It will need the support of men and women in all parts of our society.

The Council will represent a coming together of several streams: politicians who recognise that the drift towards extremism in the Labour Party is not compatible with the democratic traditions of the party they joined and those from outside politics who believe that the country cannot be saved without changing the sterile and rigid framework into which the British political system has increasingly fallen in the last two decades.

We do not believe in the politics of an inert centre merely representing the lowest common denominator between two extremes. We want more, not less, radical change in our society, but with a greater stability of direction.

Our economy needs a healthy public sector and a healthy private sector without frequent frontier changes.

We want to eliminate poverty and promote greater equality without stifling enterprise or imposing bureaucracy from the centre. We need the innovating strength of a competitive economy with a fair distribution of rewards.

We favour competitive public enterprise, co-operative ventures and profit-sharing.

There must be more decentralisation of decision-making in industry and government, together with an effective and practical system of democracy at work.

The quality of our public and community services must be improved and they must be made more responsive to people s needs. We do not accept that mass unemployment is inevitable. A number of countries, mainly those with social democratic governments, have managed to combine high employment with low inflation.

Britain needs to recover its self-confidence and be outward-looking, rather than isolationist, xenophobic or neutralist. We want Britain to play a full and constructive role within the framework of the European Community, NATO, the United Nations and the Commonwealth.

It is only within such a multi-lateral framework that we can hope to negotiate international agreements covering arms control and disarmament and to grapple effectively with the poverty of the Third World.

We recognise that for those people who have given much of their lives to the Labour Party, the choice that lies ahead will be deeply painful. But we believe that the need for a realignment of British politics must now be faced.

<doc id="5044783" title="Federal Commonwealth Society" nonfiltered="129" processed="129" dbindex="450129">
The Federal Commonwealth Society (FCS) is an organisation that promotes closer ties among Commonwealth nations, centred around the core group of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, British Overseas Territories, Cook Islands, Niue and their Dependencies, referred to collectively as CANZUK. Founded in London, UK in 2002, the FCS Head Office is now located in Toronto, Canada.


Ultimately, the FCS seeks the creation of a CANZUK federation, perhaps including other members of the Commonwealth. Its more immediate aim is the establishment of free trade, freedom of movement and reciprocal citizenship rights among the CANZUK countries, along the lines of the Closer Economic Relations and Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement agreements between New Zealand and Australia.

Membership of the FCS is free and open to both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth citizens anywhere in the world. Input from everyone is most welcome. Members can vote on and discuss variations of the proposal.

The key reason for the federation is to build global economic links amongst countries that share similar constitutional, institutional and cultural links and to free these countries from outside economic domination. Another main purpose for federation of the four CANZUK countries is for all of them to enjoy access to all of the markets of their current economic partnerships including NAFTA, the European Union, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. However, since those core nations included have been selected for their large cultural similarities and mostly identical institutions, the proposal to have Queen Elizabeth II as head of the federation is due to the fact that all proposed nations so far have Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. The FCS plan also clearly indicates that a republican model for the federation is an acceptable alternative and that the constitution of the proposed federation is up to its people to decide. Even though the FCS currently advocates federation of only the core CANZUK countries for now due to economic reasons, the FCS has openly admitted that it is perfectly willing for other Commonwealth Nations, including republics, to be included in the federation with time so long as they meet the democratic, civil rights and economic stability of other Federation members. The FCS is not affiliated with any political party and does not support any extremist agendas. Members are located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa, Sweden, Ireland, the United States and the Caribbean.

Structure.
The Federal Commonwealth Society is composed of general members and an FCS council, which currently consists of a president (Mr. James Alcock), two vice presidents (Mr. Micah Sicotte (UK & Canada), Mr. Ben Simpson (Australia & New Zealand), a secretary (Mr. Ashley Ryder) and president emeritus (Mr. Nick Thompson) with area representation for Scotland, Wales and London. The aim of the FCS council is purely administrative and there is little difference between the members of the FCS council and a general member in terms of relative power within the FCS. 

There are no membership fees and both commonwealth and non-commonwealth nationals may join. Projects are ongoing and include associations with political, social and independent organisations in the CANZUK member countries and related spheres. Further details are given on the  FCS webpage.

Jeev Milkha Singh (born 15 December 1971) was the first Indian golfer to become a member of the European Tour. Jeev is the highest ranked Indian golfer in the world, breaking into the top 100 in October 2006. He is the son of the famous Indian Sikh athlete Milkha Singh. Singh lives in the city of Chandigarh.

Singh attended Abilene Christian University in the United States of America and won the NCAA Division II individual golf championship in 1993. He also won a number of amateur tournaments in the U.S. His first professional win came at the 1993 Southern Oklahoma State Open, a minor local event, but he played mainly in Asia, where he was a regular winner in the mid 1990s. In 1997 he finished seventh at the European Tour qualifying school, and he joined the tour the following year. 

His best season in Europe up until 2006 was in 1999, when he came 50th on the Order of Merit. He struggled with injury in the early years of the new century but in April 2006 he won the Volvo China Open, becoming the second Indian to win on the European Tour after Arjun Atwal. He also won the season ending Volvo Masters, which elevated him to a final position of 16th on the Order of Merit. He finished 2006 as the winner of the Asian Tour Order of Merit and capped his season with a pair of back to back wins in Japan to become the first Indian to make the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings.

  SEX HEADACHE

Introduction

Sexual activity   especially orgasm   can trigger a headache. You may notice a dull ache in your head and neck that builds up as sexual excitement increases and peaks during orgasm. Or you may experience a sudden, severe headache during orgasm.

Most sex headaches are nothing to worry about. But proper diagnosis is important. Sometimes sex headaches are a sign of something serious, such as bleeding in the brain or stroke.

Signs and symptoms

Sex headaches often start as a dull ache on both sides of the head. The pain may intensify as sexual excitement increases.

In other cases, sex headaches appear suddenly during orgasm. You may feel severe pain around or behind your eyes. Some peopledescribe the pain as pulsing, throbbing or a sudden blow to the head. The pain may get worse when you move.

Most sex headaches last a few minutes. Others may linger for a few hours

Causes

Any type of sexual activity that leads to orgasm   including masturbation, oral sex and intercourse   can trigger sex headaches.

Dull, achy sex headaches are thought to be caused by tightening the head and neck muscles during sexual activity. Sex headaches associated with orgasm may be a response to increased blood pressure that causes the cerebral blood vessels to dilate.

In other cases, medications such as birth control pills and pseudoephedrine (a common decongestant in many over-the-counter cold remedies) have been linked to sex headaches.

Sex headaches aren't usually related to the amount of physical exertion associated with sexual activity.

Risk factors

Sex headaches can affect anyone. But they're more common in men and people who are prone to migraines. Sex headaches may be more likely if you're tired, stressed or have sex multiple times in rapid succession.

When to seek medical advice

Sex headaches aren't usually a cause for concern. But it's a good idea to consult your doctor if you experience headaches during sexual activity   especially if it's your first headache of this type. Sex headaches may indicate a serious underlying problem, such as bleeding in the brain or stroke.


Screening and diagnosis

Your doctor may recommend a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam to detect any underlying causes for your headache. During the exam, a magnetic field and radio waves are used to create cross-sectional images of the structures within your brain.

In other cases, a computed tomography (CT) scan of your brain may be done. Computerized tomography uses an X-ray unit that rotates around your body and a computer to create cross-sectional images (like slices) of your brain and head.

Sometimes a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is needed as well   especially if the headache appeared suddenly. With this procedure, the doctor removes a small amount of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. The fluid sample can be tested for protein, white blood cells and other substances.

Complications

Sex headaches aren't associated with any physical complications. But fear of recurrent headaches may turn into a fear of having sex, which can affect intimate relationships and how you feel about sex.

Treatment

Sex headaches often disappear on their own. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen may help ease the pain of a lingering headache.

If you have a history of sex headaches, your doctor may recommend preventive therapy before sex. Sometimes aspirin or ibuprofen is enough. In other cases, medications such as propranolol (Inderal, others) or indomethacin (Indocin, others) may be an option.

Prevention

Sometimes sex headaches can be prevented by stopping sexual activity before orgasm. Slowing down the pace and relaxing neck and jaw muscles during sexual activity may help, too.

Collaroy is a suburb in the local council area of Warringah, on the northern beaches of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is approximately 20 kilometres north-north-east of Sydney's central business district. Collaroy's shopping precinct is centred along Pittwater Road, which runs north-south through the suburb. Collaroy has an excellent beach and is popular with backpackers. It has grown vigorously since the mid twentieth century. To the north is the suburb of Narrabeen, to the east is the Tasman Sea, to the south is Dee Why, and to the west is Collaroy Plateau.

Collaroy features a mix of modern detached houses and medium density apartment blocks.
Collaroy was named for the collier Collaroy which sank off the coast in 1881 during a storm. 

Transport.
Collaroy's public transport consists of buses operated by Sydney Buses. Routes 182 through 190 run south to the CBD (express services take about 35 minutes) and north to suburbs from Narrabeen to Palm Beach. Route 155 runs south to Manly (from where ferries and JetCats connect with the CBD). There are no train services in the area.

Politics.
For federal elections, Collaroy is in the seat of Mackellar. The seat is held by Bronwyn Bishop of the Liberal Party. The seat has been held continuously by the Liberals since it was created in 1949.

For NSW state elections, Collaroy is in the seat of Wakehurst.  The seat is held by Brad Hazzard of the Liberal Party. See .

Local political issues include:

 Erosion of Collaroy beach, due to removal of the sand dunes to create space for beachfront housing.
 Overdevelopment - the replacement of detached houses by apartment blocks, with subsequent increased pressure on local services, roads, and transport.

Saline water is water that contains a significant concentration of dissolved salts. The concentration is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm) of salt. Sea water has a salinity of roughly 35,000 ppm, equivalent to 35 g/L. The USGS uses the following terms to classify water of different salinities:



Another classification for water salinity appears as follows:


With the scarcity of fresh water in some areas of the world, the world is taking more notice of uses for slightly saline water and methods to desalinate it. For example, in Colorado, water having up to 2,500 ppm of salt is used for irrigating crops. Normally, moderately or highly salinated is of little use to humans. Humans cannot drink salinated water, nor is it suitable for irrigating crops. Industry also rarely uses salinated water because of the effect salt water has on metal components, among other reasons.

 Saline water use .

In today's world people are more aware of the need to conserve freshwater. With the ever-growing demand for water by growing populations worldwide, many people have taken it upon themselves to try to find more uses for the abundant saline water supplies that exist, mainly in the oceans. By looking at the United States water-use one can see the amounts used. About 15 percent of all water used in the United States in 2000 was saline. Almost all saline withdrawals, over 96 percent, were used by the thermoelectric-power industry to cool electricity-generating equipment. About two percent of the nation's saline water was used for mining and industrial purposes.

 Saline water use by State, United States, 2000 .

Due to their proximity to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, states on the eastern and western coasts of the United States and those States which border on the Gulf of Mexico make the most use of saline water. Almost 50% of all saline water used occurred in California, Florida, and Maryland.

 Trends in saline-water use, 1950-2000 .

The use of saline water, and freshwater also, has been trending downward since peaking in 1980. But, in the period between 1950 and 1980, the use of saline water increased at a much higher rate than freshwater use.

Mr. Standfast is the third of five Richard Hannay novels by John Buchan, first published in 1919 by Hodder & Stoughton, London. 

It is one of two Hannay novels set during the First World War, the other being Greenmantle (1916); Hannay's first and best-known adventure, The Thirty-Nine Steps (1915), is set in the period immediately before the war started. 

The title is taken from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, to which there are many other references in the book; Hannay uses a copy of Pilgrim's Progress to decipher coded messages from his contacts, and letters from his friend Peter Pienaar.

Plot introduction.
Set in the later years of World War I, Brigadier-General Hannay is recalled from active service on the Western Front to undertake a secret mission hunting for a dangerous German agent at large in Britain. He is forced to work undercover disguised as a pacifist, roaming the country incognito to investigate the deadly spy and his agents, and then heads to the Swiss Alps to save Europe from being overwhelmed by the German army. 

Plot summary.

 Part One .

Dick Hannay, under forty and already a successful Brigadier-General with good prospects of advancement, is called out of uniform by his old comrade, spymaster Sir Walter Bullivant, and sent to Fosse Manor in the Cotswolds to receive further instructions. He must pose as a South African, an objector to the war, and once more takes on the name Cornelius Brandt (which he had used on his adventures in Germany in Greenmantle). He is upset by the idea of such a pose, but comforted by thoughts of his friend Peter Pienaar, briefly a successful airman and now a prisoner in Germany, and by the beauty of the Cotswold countryside.

At Fosse, he meets two middle-aged spinsters, their cousin Launcelot Wake, a conscientious objector, and their niece Mary Lamington, a girl whose prettiness had struck Hannay earlier, while visiting a shell-shocked friend in the hospital where she works. It emerges that she is his contact, but she can tell him little more than that he must immerse himself in the world of pacifists and objectors, picking up "atmosphere". She gives him a label to paste inside his watch, an address where he will be staying, and advises him to pick up a copy of Pilgrim's Progress.

Hannay heads to Biggleswick, a small town full of artists and writers. He buries himself in their pacifist community, attending meetings at a local hall, and meets Moxon Ivery, a local bigwig who seems vaguely familiar; he also sees Mary about the place. He hears of his old comrade John Blenkiron, and one day the American appears at one of the town's meetings; he passes a message to Hannay, arranging to meet in London.

Blenkiron reveals that he has been hard at work for some time, around the world and undercover around England, on the track of a huge network of German spies and agents, with their head somewhere in Britain, leaking vital information to the enemy. He believes Ivery to be the spider at the centre of the web, but cannot prove it, and wants to use Ivery to feed misinformation to the Germans. He tells Hannay to try and head for Scotland and an American called Gresson, as he believes the information is being sent that way.

Hannay goes to Glasgow, and contacts a trade union man named Amos, through whom he moves into Gresson's circles. He speaks at a meeting which descends into violence, and finds himself in at Gresson's side in a street fight. He saves the day, but makes an enemy of a big Fusilier named Geordie Hamilton. He later learns that Gresson makes regular boat trips up the coast, and plans to tag along.

He rides the foul boat, but realises he needs a passport to go all the way north, and must follow it on shore, dodging the law. He has a hint from his contact that a mine at a place called Ranna may be what he seeks, and hears the boat stops at an iron mine, so he resolves to head that way. He leaves the boat and treks inland, but soon finds he is wanted by the law, and is caught by some soldiers. He claims to be a soldier too, and their Colonel takes him home with him, to meet his check his story; the son confirms all Hannay's army knowledge, and suspicions are allayed.

He moves on, staying overnight with peasants, making his way onto Skye and towards Ranna. Arriving there, he meets Amos, who goes to fetch supplies, and sees the boat and Gresson, who meets a stranger on the hill. Hannay tracks the foreign-looking stranger to a rocky bay, where the man disappears for a time before heading back. Hannay stays there overnight, and next morning fetches his provisions and searches the beach, finding the deep water of the bay ideal for submarines. He finds a hidden cave, and while preparing to lay in wait there sees Launcelot Wake climbing in. They fight and Hannay ties the other man up, but they soon realise they are on the same side.

They stake out the cave, and in the night the man Hannay followed returns, meeting with a German from the sea; they exchange pass-phrases, and Hannay sees the hiding place they plan to use to pass messages. Wake identifies some of their talk as extracts from Goethe, and is sent back with messages for Amos and Bullivant, while Hannay ponders the phrases he overheard - Bommaerts, Chelius, Wild Bird and Caged Bird. He heads for home, but Amos warns him the police are still after him, and gives him a new disguise, as a travelling bookseller.

On the way south he takes up with another salesman, a man named Linklater who Amos had seen with Gresson. In a small town, Hannay is recognised by Geordie Hamilton, the big soldier he fought with in Glasgow, and flees once more with half the town, including Linklater, on his tail. He hides out in a troop train heading south; he gets off when it stops, is seen by Linklater, but at the station hooks up with his old pal Archie Roylance, a pilot who flies him on southwards. The plane breaks down, and Hannay, still pursued, flees afoot once more, upsetting a film set, stealing a bicycle and making his way into another town. On the verge of capture, his watch is stolen, and he is dragged of the streets by a man who recognises the badge he carries there; he is given a soldier's outfit and sent on his way.

He arrives in London in the midst of an air raid; in a tube station he sees Ivery, the spymaster's guard down in fear, and Hannay finally recognises him as one of the "Black Stone" men he had tangled with in The Thirty-Nine Steps. Hurrying to tell his colleagues, he is arrested as a deserter and delayed. He eventually gets word through to Macgillivray at Scotland Yard, but his enemy has two hours start and evades capture.

Hannay is encouraged by a letter from Peter Pienaar, and at a meeting with Bullivant, Blenkiron and Mary, he pushes for them to hound the man down. They discuss the clues Hannay overheard on the beach, and Ivery's fear of the bombing, and Mary reveals that Ivery has proposed to her.

 Part Two .

Hannay returns to the war in Europe for several months. He finds Geordie Hamilton, and employs him as his batman; he runs into Launcelot Wake, working as a support labourer behind the lines; he sees several adverts in English and German newspapers, which he suspects may be some kind of coded communication.  Hamilton reports having seen Gresson in a party of touring visitors, and Hannay learns he had stayed behind in a small village for a time; he later hears a story of mysterious goings-on at a chateau near the same village. 

Flying with Archie Roylance on a reconnoitre, they get lost in fog and land near the chateau in question, where Hannay sees a mysterious old woman in a gas mask. Finding the castle is in a vital strategic spot, he returns to investigate, and learns the place is leased by a man named Bommaerts, one of the words he had overheard on the beach in Skye. Sneaking into the house at night, he finds Mary there too, and learns she has seen Ivery, now calling himself Bommaerts, who is in love with her. They find anthrax powder and a newpaper with one of the adverts deciphered, and then Ivery arrives. Confronted by Hannay, he flees, and Hannay shoots after him; the chateau burns down. 

A few days later, in January 1918, Hannay is withdrawn from the front for more special duties. Blenkiron gives dinner for Hannay and Mary, now engaged, where he learns that the newspaper advert scam has been broken up and its operatives, led by Gresson, arrested. Blenkiron has found a second code in the messages, used by Ivery and his masters, and has identified Ivery as the Graf von Schwabing, a former high-flyer unseated by scandal. He hears of the Wild Birds, a ruthless and deadly band of German spies, of whom Ivery is a leading member, and learns that they plan to head to Switzerland to pin Ivery down, using Mary as bait.

Hannay makes his way south to Switzerland, where he poses as an injured Swiss, servant to the crippled Peter Pienaar, who has been released there. The two catch up, swap stories, and await instructions, keeping an eye on the nearby Pink Chalet, believed to be the base of the Wild Birds. Finally receiving Blenkiron's instructions, Hannay goes one night to the chalet, where he meets his contact, but is betrayed and taken prisoner by von Schwabing. The German tells Hannay he plans to capture Mary too, and send them both back to Germany to deal with at his pleasure, while the German army attacks and crushes their enemies.

Von Schwabing leaves him pinned in an ancient rack, but he breaks free. He runs into the man he followed across Skye, and, using the pass-phrases he overheard there, poses as a conspirator. He is provided with a car and chases after von Schwabing, sending Peter to alert the others. After a long drive through the mountains, he crashes the car and runs the rest of the way, but arrives to find Mary already gone and Launcelot Wake waiting for him. Learning that von Schwabing is returning to the chalet the long way, they resolve to head over the mountains on foot, cutting out much of the road.

Wake, an experienced mountaineer, leads a tough climb through snow and ice, exhausting himself in the process. Hannay drags him to the safety of a cottage, then continues by train and again on foot. He arrives at the house, and staggers in, to see von Schwabing gloating over Blenkiron, who appears to have walked into the same trap Hannay had the night before. However, Blenkiron was warned by Hannay's message, and has the house in his command; Geordie Hamilton and Amos emerge and take von Schwabing prisoner.

At Hannay's suggestion, von Schwabing is sent to the front to see battle, while the others head to Paris, just as the Germans begin a mighty attack. As they near the front, they hear the defenses are crumbling beneath the onslaught, with Hannay's men at the heart of things. He resumes his command, and holds a thin line against the German advance, with Wake running messages for him, Blenkiron engineering the reserve trenches and Mary nursing in a nearby hospital. Amos and Hamilton guard von Schwabing, whose mind has gone strange. 

A long and hard battle ensues, in the course of which Wake dies heroically, von Schwabing runs into No Man's Land and is shot by his countrymen, and Blenkiron joins the fray with a party of Americans. At the last, with reinforcements due any moment, a party of German planes overflies Hannay's position, and are sure to bear news of the weak point if allowed to return; British planes fly against them, but one, flown by flying ace Lensch, evades them. Peter Pienaar, flying Archie Roylance's plane despite his bad leg, flies into him, bringing him down and killing himself in the process, and the day is saved.

Jean-Luc Thérier (born Hodeng-au-Bosc , October 7, 1945) is a French former rally driver. He was the highest scoring driver in the inaugural World Rally Championship in 1973 and the only one to win three events. However, until 1977 the championship was only formally contested by manufacturers, not individuals, so only Thérier's Alpine-Renault team were formally awarded the title.

He most frequently competed in an Alpine Renault A110, winning the Rallye Sanremo and the Acropolis Rally in 1970. He won the same two events again in 1973, along with the Rallye Sanremo, during his annus memorabilis.

He also won the 1974 Press-on-Regardless Rally in the United States driving a Renault 17 Gordini, and the 1980 Tour de Corse behind the wheel of a Porsche 911 SC.

The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was the first railway line in Scotland and ran services between Kilmarnock and Troon.

History.
The line began life as a waggonway which opened on 6 July 1812.  On 16 July 1846 the line was leased to the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, who began services after regauging the tracks for locomotives. The line was bought by its successor, the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1899 who ran services until the line's closure on 3 May 1969.

 Connections to other lines .

 Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway at Barassie and Kilmarnock;
 Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway at Kilmarnock;

 Current Operations .
On 5 May 1975 the line was reopened and today is part of the Glasgow South Western Line providing services to Stranraer via Kilmarnock. The intermediate stations between Barassie and Kilmarnock remain closed, and the line remains unelectrified. As part of the resignalling prior to the electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line, the Kilmarnock line through Barassie station was singled and the platforms taken out of use.

All Things Must Pass is a triple album by George Harrison recorded and released after the break-up of The Beatles. The first triple album by a single artist, the original vinyl release featured two records of rock songs, while the third, entitled "Apple Jam" was composed of informal jams led by Harrison with musician friends.

Received as a masterpiece upon its 1970 unveiling, All Things Must Pass is widely considered to be among the very best albums made by a Beatle as a solo artist and one of the finer albums of the rock era. It is certified 6x Platinum by the RIAA, making it the best selling album by a solo Beatle.

History.
The outpouring of such consistently great material on All Things Must Pass took many critics by surprise, with Harrison having long been overshadowed by the talents of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, despite the fact that some of his later period Beatles inclusions ("While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Something," and "Here Comes the Sun") were hailed as highlights of their respective albums. Consequently, as Harrison had only placed just a few songs on any given Beatles album, he had amassed many compositions by their break-up, enabling him to offload many of them in one go on All Things Must Pass.

Recorded from May to August 1970 at Abbey Road Studios, and then further recording and mixing at Trident Studios from August to September 1970, Harrison enlisted the aid of Phil Spector to co-produce the album, giving All Things Must Pass a heavy and reverb-oriented sound, typical for a 1960s/1970s Spector production   but a sound Harrison would subsequently regret with the passage of time. The album features the talents of Ringo Starr, Peter Frampton, members of Badfinger, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, and a young Phil Collins who was about to join Genesis. Bob Dylan, a close friend of Harrison's, composed "I'd Have You Anytime" with him, while Harrison covered Dylan's "If Not For You", which had been recently released on Dylan's New Morning album. Alan White, later of Yes, stated that John Lennon played on "If Not For You".

All Things Must Pass lead single was "My Sweet Lord"   which proved an enormously popular recording, reaching #1 worldwide, earned Harrison an unfortunate copyright infringement suit from the publishers of The Chiffons's 1963 hit "He's So Fine"   a plagiarism grievance that would not be settled for years. (A judge later found that Harrison had unintentionally plagiarised the earlier song; this prompted Harrison to later write "This Song".) The album itself reached #4 in the UK and spent seven weeks at #1 in the U.S., eventually going six times platinum, making All Things Must Pass Harrison's most commercially successful and generally best-loved album.

Anglo-Australian pop singer Olivia Newton-John's cover of Harrison's "What Is Life" reached the UK top twenty in 1972. (The year before, she reached the top ten with a cover of Dylan's "If Not For You", arranged similarly to Harrison's version; in the US, her version became her first successful pop single,reaching #25. She would cover another song from All Things Must Pass, "Behind That Locked Door").

A remastered edition of All Things Must Pass, supervised by Harrison, was released in 2001, just months before his death; it contained bonus tracks, including a partially re-recorded additional version of "My Sweet Lord". It also included a newly colourised version of the originally monochrome cover. With the original version of the album being concurrently deleted, the remastered edition of All Things Must Pass is the only commercially available version of the release. Many have criticized the digital re-mastering, which though now quiter in the backround, has been robbed of much of its' high end. As a response, an unofficial 2006 "Dr.Ebbett's" CD re-mastering has appeared, sourced from pristine unplayed USA Lp pressings. This particular private CD issue sounds pretty much exactly the same as the original USA Apple label LP's. There is no high end loss.

On July 29, 2006, The Official UK Charts company changed their records because there was a postal strike when the album had originally been on the charts. Since record retailers had to send in records of how many records had been sold, they could not during an eight-week period in 1971. All Things Must Pass, which had originally peaked at number 4 (with Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water at number one), now has been given the number one spot for all eight weeks.

<doc id="62768" title="Déagol" nonfiltered="153" processed="153" dbindex="450153">

Déagol is a minor though significant character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. His story is related in The Fellowship of the Ring, the first of three volumes comprising Tolkien's most famous novel, The Lord of the Rings, in the chapter "The Shadow of the Past".  

Biography.

Tolkien wrote that Déagol was a Stoor Hobbit who lived in a small community bound by kinship ties - akin to a clan. He had a friend named Sméagol, whose grandmother was the matriarch of the community. 

In 2463 of the Third Age, Déagol became the third bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron and Isildur. After it was lost for hundreds of years, he found the Ring while fishing with Sméagol in the Gladden river (a tributary to the Anduin).

Enticed by its beauty, Sméagol demanded the Ring as his "birthday-present". When Déagol refused to give it up, he was choked to death. Sméagol hid his body, which was never found; nevertheless, the murderer (nicknamed Gollum after the swallowing noises he made) was eventually driven from his home.


Name.
Déagol is an Old English translation of the "original" Westron name Nahald (as Tolkien pretended that his writings were translated from the Red Book of Westmarch, a collection of several books containing memoirs of his heroes among other things). Both names carry the meaning "apt to hide, secretive".

Adaptations.
Déagol appears in the prologue to Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.  

In Peter Jackson's 2001-2003 live-action adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, Déagol is played by New Zealand actor Thomas Robins. His scenes with Andy Serkis (Sméagol/Gollum) were originally planned to be in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, but were moved to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

Alfred Howard Carter (1891-1971) was one of the greatest pioneers of the Pentecostal Christian faith.

 While serving in prison .

Carter was born in London.  During the time of World War I, Carter served in a prison in England as a conscientious objector to the war.  While serving in prison, he claimed to have received the revelation of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit. These teachings, based on the text of 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, are still used today as the primary teaching on the gifts of the Spirit within all major Pentecostal Christian belief systems.

 The Crown Mission .

In 1913 an organization called the Crown Mission began in Birmingham. Shortly thereafter, Carter would become the leader of this group. By 1916 he became involved in a second Pentecostal work, and had to quit his regular work to maintain leadership of the two churches. 

 Hampstead Bible School .

In 1921 Carter was handed over leadership of Hampstead Bible School, originally to be on a temporary basis until a more suitable person was available to fill the opening. That never happened, as he held this position for some twenty seven years. Under Carter's leadership the school grew so much that they had to purchase a nearby house and two more Bible schools were opened up. 

He took his work so seriously at the school that he did not receive any of the money donated to the school for his own use unless it was marked specifically for him, and he paid his own room and board to the school out of his salary. 

 Assemblies of God .

Howard Carter later became a founding member of the Assemblies of God Church in Ireland and Great Britain. He served on the General Council of these groups as vice-chairman from 1929-1934, and as chairman from 1934-1945.

 His final days .

Howard Carter left the Hampstead Bible School in 1948 and moved to the United States. He spent the rest of his life there and began to travel extensively as a preacher until his death in 1971.

 Howard Carter and Lester Sumrall .

Howard Carter and Lester Sumrall first met in Eureka Springs, Arkansas when Carter was in his forties and Sumrall was in his early twenties. They formed an immediate relationship and traveled the world together as missionaries preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Sumrall has written about Carter in his books Adventuring with Christ and Pioneers of Faith. Sumrall also expounds on Carter's teachings of the nine gifts of the Spirit in his book The Gifts and Ministries of the Holy Spirit.

For other uses of Luxembourg see Luxembourg (disambiguation);

The Duchy of Luxembourg was created when Emperor Charles IV elevated the old county of Luxembourg in 1353 for his brother Wenceslaus I.


Territory.
The duchy of Luxembourg was formed in 1353 by integration of the old county of the same name, the marquisat of Arlon, the counties of Durbuy and Laroche as well as the districts of Thionville, Bitburg and Marville. The county of Vianden can also be included as it had been a vassal of the counts and dukes of Luxembourg since about July 31 1264.

History.

the county.
In the year 963 count Siegfried of the Ardennes bought some land from the abbot Wikerus of Saint Maximin in Trier. This land was centered around a ruined, supposedly roman, fort by the latin name of Lucilinburhuc (which is commonly translated as little castle). In the following years Siegfried had a new castle built on the site of these ruins, on a rock that would later be called Bock Fiels. This castle dominated a stretch of the old roman road linking Reims, Arlon and Trier, which also opened some prospects for trade and taxation. Despite this new construction it seems that Siegfried and his immediate successors did not make the castle their primary residence.

In following years a small town and market grew around the new castle. The first inhabitants were probably servants of count Siegfried and clergy of Saint Michael's church. This settlement soon received additional protection by the construction of a first, partial city wall and moat.  In addition to the small town near Bock Fiels and the roman road, another settlement was formed in the Alzette Valley (today the Grund quarter). By 1083 this lower town contained two churches, two bridges of the rivers Alzette and Petruss. Its inhabitants pursued various professions including fishery, bakers and millers. That same year the Benedictine abbey of Altmünster was founded by count Conrad on the hill behind Luxembourg castle.

Henry III was the first count known to have established his permanent residence in Luxembourg castle. In a document from the year 1089 he is referred to as comes Henricus de Lutzeleburg, which also makes him the first documented count of Luxembourg.

<doc id="1173689" title="Stress fracture" nonfiltered="159" processed="159" dbindex="450159">

This article is about stress fractures in bones. For stress fractures in engineering, see fracture and fatigue (material).;

A stress fracture is one type of incomplete fractures in bones.  It could be described as a very small sliver or crack in the bone; this is why it is sometimes dubbed "hairline fracture". It typically occurs in weight-bearing bones, such as the tibia/fibula (bones of the lower leg) and metatarsals (bones of the foot). It is a common sports injury.

Symptoms.
Stress fractures usually have a narrow list of symptoms. It could present as a generalized area of pain, tenderness, and pain with weight-bearing. Usually when running, a stress fracture has severe pain in the beginning of the run, moderate pain in the middle of the run, and severe pain at the end and after the run.

Workup.
As with most diseases, a stress fracture is best diagnosed after interview and examination by an astute physician.  Investigations are not necessary to diagnose a stress fracture.

X-rays usually do not show any evidence of stress fractures, so a CT scan, MRI, or 3-phase bone scan may be more effective in unclear cases. Histological examination of the bone is the most accurate test, but it obviously can only be performed on amputated limbs or during autopsy of patients who have died.

Treatment.
If a stress fracture occurs in a weightbearing bone, healing will be delayed or prevented by continuing to put weight on that limb.

Rest is the only way to completely heal a stress fracture. The average time of complete rest from the activity that caused the stress fracture is one week. A fracture requires 4 to 8 weeks of recuperation, however, which may include no more than light use of the injured body part, as long as activity does not cause pain. After the recuperative period, another 2 weeks of mild activity without any pain may be recommended before the bone may be safely considered healed and activity may gradually increase. 

During this time, it is advised that training errors be identified (for instance, too much, too soon) and avoided in the future. One rule of thumb is to not increase the volume of training by more than 10% from one week to the next.

Rehabilitation usually consists of muscle strength training to help dissipate the excessive forces transmitted to the bones.

In some cases, an electronic stimulator or bone stimulator may be used. These devices send electrical impulses into the bone to promote healing; recent studies have shown that the bone heals naturally via electromagnetic stimulation. Electromagnetically stimulating the bone causes the bone to lay out more bone cells that strengthen the bone. 

Bracing or casting the limb with a hard plastic boot or air cast may also prove beneficial by taking some stress off the stress fracture. An air cast has pre-inflated cells that put light pressure on the bone, which promotes healing by increasing blood flow to the area and takes away a lot of the pain because of the pressure it applies to the bone. If the stress fracture is severe enough, crutches also help to take all stress off the bone.
 
With severe stress fractures, surgery may be needed for proper healing. The procedure may involve pinning the fracture site, and rehabilitation takes an average of six months.

Causes.
Bones are constantly attempting to remodel and repair themselves, especially during a sport where extraordinary stress is applied to the bone. Over time, if enough stress is placed on the bone that it exhausts the capacity of the bone to remodel, a weakened site -- a stress fracture -- on the bone may appear.  The fracture does not appear suddenly.  It occurs from repeated traumas, none of which is sufficient to cause a sudden break, but which, when added together, overwhelm the osteoblasts that remodel the bone.

Stress fractures commonly occur in sedentary people who suddenly undertake a burst of exercise (whose bones are not used to the task). They may also occur in Olympic-class athletes who do extraordinary quantities of high-impact exercise, or in soldiers who march long distances.

Muscle fatigue can also play a role in the occurrence of stress fractures. For every mile a runner runs, more than 110 tons of force must be absorbed by the legs.  Bones are not made to stand that much energy on their own and the muscles act as shock absorbers for the excess force. But, as muscles become tired and stop absorbing most of the shock, the bones experience greater amounts of stress. Finally, when muscles (usually in the lower leg) become so fatigued that they stop absorbing any shock, all forces are transferred to the bones.

Frequency.
Dr. Johnathan C Reeser states that, in the US, the annual incidence of stress fractures range from 5% to 30%, depending on the sport and other risk factors. Stress fractures occur less frequently in African Americans compared to Caucasians due to a higher BMD (bone mineral density). Women and highly-active individuals are also at a higher risk. The incidence probably also increases with age due to age-related reductions in BMD. But children may also be at risk because their bones have yet to reach full density and strength. The female athlete triad also can put women at risk, as disordered eating and osteoporosis can cause the bones to be severely weakened.

Prevention.
One method of avoiding stress fractures is by adding more stress to the bones. Although counter-intuitive given that stress fractures are caused by too much stress on the bones, when moderate stress is applied to the bone in a controlled manner, the bone becomes stronger and less susceptible to a stress fracture. An easy way to do this is to follow one widely known rule for runners, which states that mileage should be increased by no more than 10% per week. This allows the bones to adapt to the added stress so they are able to withstand greater amounts of stress in the future.

Strengthening exercises also help build more muscle strength in the legs. Strengthening these  muscles will stop them from getting fatigued so quickly, which allows them to absorb the pounding of running for longer periods of time. Key muscles that need to be strengthened with lower leg stress fractures are the calves and the shin muscles.

Depending on a variety of factors including weight, running surface and shoe durability, runners should replace their shoes every 300-700 miles to allow adequate mid-sole cushioning. A change in the choice of running surfaces can also help prevent stress fractures.

When performing any exercise that applies more stress to the bones, it may be wise to increase calcium and vitamin D intake, depending on the individual. Also, it is important to monitor foods eaten because nutrition plays a vital role in bone development. Certain individuals are at risk of osteoporosis, and depending on the country in which medical care is being supplied, there may be a screening program in place.

For other persons known as Princess Victoria, see Princess Victoria (disambiguation);

The Princess Victoria (Victoria Alexandra Olga Mary; 6 July 1868-3 December 1935) was a member of the British Royal Family, the fourth child and second daughter of King Edward VII. 

Early life.
Princess Victoria was born on 6 July 1868 at Marlborough House, London. Her father was The Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Her mother was The Princess of Wales (née Princess Alexandra of Denmark), the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel. As the granddaughter of the British monarch she was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Wales. She was known to her family as Toria.

She was christened at Marlborough House on 6 August 1868 by Archibald Campbell Tait, Bishop of London and her godparents were: Queen Victoria, The Emperor of Russia, The Tsarevitch of Russia, The Prince Arthur, Prince Ludwig of Hesse and by Rhine, Prince George of Hesse-Cassel, The Queen of Greece, The Dowager Queen of Denmark, The Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, The Princess of Teck and The Princess Friedrich of Anhalt-Dessau.

Princess Victoria of Wales was educated by tutors and spent her childhood at Marlborough House and Sandringham. The Princess was particularly close to her brother, the future King George V.

Royal life.
Although she had a number of suitors, Princess Victoria never married. Her mother, Alexandra, is believed to have actively discouraged her from marrying.  Instead she remained a companion to her parents, particularly her mother, with whom she lived until Queen Alexandra's death in 1925. The Princess then set up her own home at Coppins, Iver, in Buckinghamshire. She took a particular interest in the village life, becoming honorary president of the Iver Horticultural Society.

Later life.

Princess Victoria died at home in December 1935. Her funeral took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle and she was buried at Frogmore Royal Burial Ground, Windsor Great Park. Her death greatly affected George V, who died one month later.

The Shire of Corrigin is a Local Government Area of Western Australia based in the town of Corrigin (; post code: 6375). It covers an area of about 3,100 km² in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia about 230km east-south-east of the capital, Perth. It has a population of 1,276 (ABS 2001) and the economy, worth approximately $50 million per year to the state economy, is based on agriculture - predominantly cereal grains and sheep, with some supporting industries including a flour mill.

History.
From 1891 until 1913, different parts of the area was managed by Morambine (Pingelly), Greenhills and Brookton Road Boards. In 1913, after the announcement of a proposed railway from Brookton on the Great Southern Railway to terminate in the town of Kunjin, the Kunjinn Road Board was gazetted. The first Board members held their meetings in a small timber and iron building with their first ever purchase being a billy, tea and sugar. After only three meetings, it was decided to shift the meeting venue to the new townsite of Corrigin as Kunjin was no longer under consideration as the major rail junction. Accordingly, in 1914, it changed name to the Corrigin Road Board. On 1 July 1961, it became the Shire Council following changes to the Local Government Act.

Wards.
The shire has been divided into 3 wards, each of 3 councillors:

 North Ward;
 Central Ward;
 South Ward;

The combined gas law is a gas law which combines Charles's law, Boyle's law, and Gay-Lussac's law. In each of these laws, pressure, temperature, and volume, respectively, must remain constant for the law to be true.  In the combined gas law, any of these properties can be found mathematically.

The law states that:

The product of the volume of a gas and its pressure over the temperature is equal to a constant.;

Expressed mathematically, the formula is:

;

where:

p is the pressure.
V is the volume.
T is the temperature (measured in kelvin in SI units).
r is a constant.

For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be written as:

;

We can however remove  from the equation because it is constant when changing only the conditions, to make:

;

The addition of Avogadro's law to the combined gas law yields the ideal gas law.

Capron is a town in Woods County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 42 at the 2000 census.

Geography.

Capron is located at  (36.896307, -98.578351).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.3 km² (0.1 mi²), all land.

Demographics.
As of the census of 2000, there were 42 people, 17 households, and 10 families residing in the town. The population density was 147.4/km² (370.2/mi²). There were 20 housing units at an average density of 70.2/km² (176.3/mi²). The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White.

There are 17 households, out of which 23.5% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.8% were married couples living together, 5.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.3% were non-families. 29.4% of all households are made up of individuals, and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.18.

In the town the population is spread out, with 19.0% under the age of 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 28.6% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

The median income for a household in the town was $24,250, and the median income for a family was $23,750. Males had a median income of $22,500 versus $16,250 for females. The per capita income for the town was $11,156. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.

History.
Prior to the opening of the Cherokee Strip in 1893, Capron, Oklahoma was first known as "Warren", a small cattle station on the main line of the Santa Fe railroad. It consisted of a store, and an old railroad car left by the Santa Fe. Sometime after the opening of the strip residents wanted to come up with a new name for the growing town. The name was changed to "Sterling", but the postal service and Santa Fe would not accept it because there was a town by that name on their line in Kansas. The names of "Virgil" and "Kermit" were proposed, but Santa Fe would not accept these names, for the same reason. Therefore, a committee consisting of Mr. George Espy, postmaster, Dr. G.W. Todd, and Congressman Dennis Flynn was appointed to select a name which the Santa Fe and Postal Service would accept. The name of Captain Allyn K. Capron, Jr. was proposed. Captain Capron was a member of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders, and had been killed at the battle of San Juan Hill. The name of "Capron" was approved by a petition of the residents. The Santa Fe and U. S. Postal service accepted the name and so it stands today.

At one time Capron was quite a thriving community. It had two banks; the Bank of Capron, and the Capron State Bank; three general stores; two drug stores; a hotel; depot; a millinery shop; theater; blacksmith; a weekly newspaper, The Capron Hustler; a monthly newspaper, The Screech Owl; two barber shops; hardware store; lumber yard; two churches, Warburton Memorial Methodist Church, and First Congregational Church; the Driftwood Telephone Company and Hampton's Foot Powder Factory.

In April 1939 a tornado struck Capron, making a straight line down the main business street. Many of the residents of town did not even know the tornado has struck until the next morning when they went downtown to open their stores and found them gone. Most tornados sound like trains, and since a train goes through Capron about every 20 minutes no one noticed! Most of the above businesses, and the public school building, which was only 10 years old, were destroyed. The majority of these businesses were never rebuilt. However, the public schools were rebuilt.

Capron was always concerned with having a good school system. In 1894 a small but enterprising group of Driftwood Township citizens provided for the establishment of the first Capron Public Schools. The school consisted of grades 1 8 and consisted of a two-room frame building located south and east of the present south Coop Grain Elevator. This building proved adequate until 1909 when a new two-story brick building was built in the north end of town at the site of the present school building. The cost of the 1909 building was $8,500.00. In 1929 residents approved the building of a new one-story building with a large gymnasium and auditorium attached. The old two-story building was torn down to make way for this modern facility. This building was destroyed in the 1939 tornado and a new building, auditorium and gymnasium were built in 1940. At the time, this facility was considered to be one of the best schools in northwest Oklahoma. Additions to the present building were made: in 1952, vocational agriculture building; 1956, additional classrooms and music room; and 1964, when a new cafeteria was added to the school. The high school was first accredited in 1912. In 1968 the high school was closed due to falling enrollment. There were no families in the school district on public assistance in 1968, and the patrons of the district never voted down a tax increase for their school; they wanted the very best for their children. The Elementary School, grades K 8 were closed in 1976 by a vote of the patrons which carried by only one vote. The vote was contested. This decision was taken to court and eventually upheld by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Today Capron has two large concrete grain elevators, a rural water district office, United Methodist Church, garage, filling station, and American Legion Post. The Post Office closed in 1994 after 100 years of service to the citizens of the area. It is hard to believe that any of this once thriving little center of trade ever existed and today lives only in the memories of many of its older residents.

<doc id="2823760" title="Tonicity" nonfiltered="173" processed="173" dbindex="450173">
Tonicity is the ability of a solution to cause water movement. It is in reference to hypertonic, hypotonic and isotonic cellular states.

Tonicity differs between animal cells and plant cells. Since plants cells have a cell wall, instead of shrinking or bursting the plant cell is considered to be plasmolyzed if it is placed in a hypertonic solution and is considered to be in its normal state if it is placed in an isotonic solution. In a hypotonic solution the plant cell is considered to be in a turgid state.

It is very important to remember that tonicity is dependent on the water concentration(or any solvent), not the solute concentration. If a solution is hypotonic, the water concentration is greater outside the cell and so water rushes into the cell in order to equal out the water concentration. This causes animal cells (without a cell wall) to burst and for plant cells (which do have a cell wall) to become turgid. If the solution is isotonic, the water concentration is the same on either side of the cell membrane and so, while water does move from inside to outside the cell and vice versa, there is no net movement of water. If the solution is hypertonic, the water concentraion inside the cell is greater. This leads to water rushing out of the cell. Animal cells shrivel up and plant cells become plasmolysed (This is where the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall in places as the cytoplasm shrinks. Note that the cell wall does not change shape.)

It is important also to note that tonicity applies to the impermeant solutes within a solvent, as opposed to osmolarity which takes into account both permeant and impermeant solutes.  For example, urea is a permeant solute, meaning it can pass the membrane freely, and will not be factored when determining the tonicity of a solution.  On the other hand, NaCl is impermeant, and cannot pass the membrane without the help of a concentration gradient, and will therefore contribute to a solution's tonicity.  It is then possible for a solution to be hypotonic, and yet be isoosmotic.
 
The elastic tension of living muscles, arteries, etc. that facilitates response to stimuli. Clinically, this is referred to as tonus (See muscle tone).

Samuel Collins (1619 1670) was a British doctor and author. He is most notable for being personal physician to Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich, during which time he wrote the book The Present State of Russia.

Biography. 
Born to a clerical family in Essex he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1635 but for some reason took no degree at the university.  As was the fashion among those pursuing medical careers, he removed to Padua where he studied the healing arts and was graduated M.D. In or around 1660 Collins was approached by John Hedben, one of several men in Russian employ assigned the task of recruiting skilled Europeans for service at the court of Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich.  Collins apparently found Hedben's proposal attractive, for he shortly moved to Moscow and took up residence.  He remained in the capital for nine years as personal physician to Tsar Aleksei. 

During this Collins gathered the material for The Present State of Russia.  He was not, however, able to finish the book himself, for he died in Paris in 1670.  The manuscript, in the form of a series of partially edited letters to Robert Boyle, was transmitted to the stationer by an unnamed attendant. Collins had corresponded with Boyle for years about scientific matters and he is frequently mentioned in Boyle's published writings.  After some very sloppy editing (for which the stationer apologizes), The Present State of Russia appeared anonymously in 1671.  A French translation was issued, also anonymously, in 1679.

Walter Bauer (1877 - 17 November, 1960) was a scholar of the development of the early Christian churches.  

In his Rechtgläubigkeit und ketzerei im altesten Christentum (Tübingen 1934; translated as Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity 1971), Bauer developed his thesis that in earliest Christianity, orthodoxy and heresy do not stand in relation to one another as primary to secondary, but in many regions heresy is the original manifestation of Christianity. Bauer reassessed as a historian the overwhelmingly dominant view that for the period of Christian origins, ecclesiastical doctrine already represented what is primary, while heresies, on the other hand somehow are a deviation from the genuine (Bauer, Introduction).

Bauer's translator, Robert A. Kraft, characterized his sophisticated, nuanced writing style, which
"presents a complex and frustrating problem for the translator who hopes to capture something of the "tone" or "flavor" of the original as well as representing accurately its content. Bauer writes in a dynamic and highly sophisticated manner, mixing precision with irony and even insinuation, pictorial language with careful presentation of the historical evidence, hypotheses and caveats with the subtle use of overstatement and understatement in cleverly nuanced expressions. His German is literary but not necessarily formal. Long sentences with closely interrelated parts appear alongside brief, sometimes cryptic or oblique comments couched in clever, often scholarly German idiom. Frequently the presentation flows along rapidly in an exciting manner, despite the difficulties of the subject matter  but its flow is such that the motion is difficult to capture in translation, and is sometimes even difficult to follow in the original.";

Through studies of historical records Bauer concluded that what came to be known as orthodoxy was just one of numerous forms of Christianity in the early centuries.  It was the form of Christianity practiced in Rome that acquired the majority of converts over time.  This was largely due to the greater resources available to the Christians in Rome and due to the conversion to Christianity of the Roman Emperor Constantine I.  Practitioners of what became orthodoxy then rewrote the history of the conflict making it appear that this view had always been the majority one.  Writings in support of other views were systematically destroyed.  Bauer's conclusions contradicted nearly 1600 years of essentially uncontested church history and thus was met with much skepticism among Christians.

The cultural isolation of Nazi Germany precluded a wider dissemination of Bauer's ideas until after World War II; Rechtgläubigkeit und ketzerei was finally translated into English in 1970 and published in 1971. In the international field of biblical scholarship, Bauer continued to be known solely as the compiler of the monumental Wörterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments (in its English translation A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature or simply the Bauer lexicon), which has become standard.

Oriole Records was a record label of the 1920s and 1930s based in the United States. The label was sold new exclusively at the McCrory chain of Department stores.  

Audio fidelity of Oriole Records is somewhat below average for the era.

The Oriole label first appeared in 1921, selling for 25 cents per disc record. Originally, Oriole records were pressed by the Cameo Record Company (generally not from Cameo material, however), but this arrangement lasted only a month or two. Most of the masters were leased from other labels, early on mostly Emerson From around number 115, Orioles were pressed by Grey Gull and usually have unusual pairings of material, with one side being a hit popular tune and the other "standard" material, sometimes classical. At number 250, Orioles were suddenly pressed by Plaza Music, Banner and were the original label which was treated as a "cheap" label, using a standard set of "noms du disque" in common with Jewel, the Sears & Roebuck label Challenge, and a few others. Plaza-pressed Orioles used "control numbers" to disguise their matrix numbers; oddly enough, these were later to appear on the flagship Banner label. After Plaza was merged into the American Record Corporation, ARC matrix numbers replaced the control numbers. 

During the 1930-32 period, ARC dropped a number of their labels; however, Oriole continued, using the same number series (which eventually reached past 2000) as well as another series for country and race records. In August, 1935, all the low-priced labels in the ARC stable began using a new date-related numbering system, in which the last digit (originally the last two digits) of the year was followed by the number for the month and finally a two-digit serial number specific to that month's releases. Race and country records started their serial numbering at 51, so a blues record released in February, 1936 would carry a number like 6-02-51.

As the depression and the popularity of radio cut into record sales, most of the store labels were discontined; another factor was that the younger record buyers looked for specific versions of their favourite tunes, so name artists like Miller and Goodman made up the majority of discs sold. The last Oriole records seem to have been issued in January, 1937. All of the low-priced labels were dropped in April, 1938 and the American Record Corporation was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System later that year.

Lindsey McDonald is a fictional character from the television series Angel. He first appeared in the series' first episode, "City of," and featured prominently in the story arcs of Seasons One, Two, and Five. Lindsey is portrayed by Christian Kane.

Character history.
Season One.
Born into a dirt-poor dysfunctional family in Oklahoma, Lindsey worked hard to overcome his upbringing. While studying at University of California, Hastings College of the Law, he was recruited for the corrupt corporation known as Wolfram & Hart. Starting in the mailroom, Lindsey quickly worked his way up, becoming one of Wolfram & Hart's most valued lawyers.

His good looks are only surpassed by his ambition. Lindsey legally represented many a vampire and demon, as well as evil humans. He meets Angel in the first episode in the series, when Angel kills Russell Winters, one of his vampire clients, by hurling him out the window of a tall building just after Lindsey had claimed that Angel couldn't touch the client in question. From that point on, Lindsey works to kill Angel, and is the co-architect of a plan to hire renegade Slayer Faith to do just that. This is not particularly well-received by his superiors, who want to keep Angel alive for their own reasons.

Lindsey experiences a crisis of conscience later, when Wolfram & Hart plan to kill a small group of innocent children, and he and Angel strike up a temporary alliance and are able to save the youngsters. After this, he is poised to leave Wolfram & Hart, but is wooed by a promotion and stays, becoming an integral player in the plan to resurrect Darla. During the ensuing battle, Angel chops off Lindsey's hand, forcing Lindsey to use an artificial one. This only further cements his hatred for Angel.

Season Two.
When Darla is returned to life, Lindsey becomes enamored with the now-human Darla, and is present when she is re-sired by Drusilla. His infatuation does not end when Darla becomes a vampire, and he is one of only two spared by Darla and Drusilla in the massacre in Holland Manners' wine cellar. With only him and Lilah left of Wolfram & Hart's Special Projects Team, their rivalry reaches an all-time high as the two start a power struggle for the vice-presidency of the team.

Darla manipulates Lindsey's feelings, which she never reciprocates, to gain his help after Angel sets her and Drusilla on fire. Darla stays at Lindsey's house, manipulating him to gain insight into Wolfram & Hart, and attempts to steal a mystical ring from the Senior Partners. Angel is at the meeting and beats her to the ring, and she is almost staked by guards but Lindsey saves her. After finding Darla with the ring, he figures out that Darla has slept with Angel.

Lindsey responds by brutally beating Angel with a sledgehammer, as well as hitting the vampire with his truck a few times, demanding to know what happened with Darla. Angel eventually gains the upper hand, smashes Lindsay's artificial hand, and steals his truck. Returning to his apartment, Lindsey finds that Darla had left town, taking all her clothes with her. Lindsey is left alone, beaten up both physically and emotionally.

Consequently, his work at the firm suffers, but he is still in a race with Lilah for the promotion. Hoping that his performance will pick up again with the return of his hand, Lindsey's superiors arrange for him to receive a mystical transplant, but the new hand acts up, writing "kill" whenever Lindsey doesn't concentrate. Fearing that the hand is evil, Lindsey goes to Caritas and sings for the Host, revealing that he used to be a regular customer and musician at Caritas until he lost his hand.

Lorne sets him and Angel on the path that will end with the two working together to discover a Wolfram & Hart facility that specializes in unwilling limb donors. Among them is the donor of Lindsey's hand, an old friend of his from his mailroom days. After figuring out that his hand isn't evil but rather suicidal, Lindsey pulls the plug on his friend and destroys the facility, while saving those that can still be saved. It is then that Lindsey decides to leave Wolfram & Hart permanently.

In a last confrontation between Angel and Lindsey, the two bury the hatchet, and Lindsey warns him of the games Wolfram & Hart is trying to play. Lindsey leaves Los Angeles and goes on a soul-searching trip, including, amongst other places, Nepal. He does not reappear for two seasons.

Season Five.
In Season Five of Angel, Lindsey finally returns to Los Angeles, when he learns that Angel has taken over the Los Angeles division of Wolfram & Hart. Although it seemed that he and Angel had buried the hatchet, Lindsey is unable to cope with the fact that Angel has gotten so easily the job that Lindsey had fought so hard for. His hatred for Angel returns in full force. Runic tattoos cover Lindsey's body, mystically hiding his presence from the Senior Partners. At some unrevealed point, he begins a relationship with Eve for whom he shows true affection.

Together, Lindsey and Eve manipulate events so that Spike, not Angel, proves (or at least appears to the Senior Partners) to be the ensouled vampire foretold in the Scrolls of Aberjian, the one who will have a crucial impact in the Apocalypse and fulfill the Shanshu Prophecy. Lindsey hopes that once the Senior Partners realize the folly of attempting to seduce Angel to their cause, that he will be stripped of his position at Wolfram & Hart, leaving a power vacuum which Lindsey could fill, gaining a measure of revenge on Angel.

The seeds of this plot are planted in the finale of Season Four of the series when Angel is given the amulet which Spike eventually uses to destroy the Hellmouth in Sunnydale. Deposited, incorporeal, in Wolfram & Hart and unable to leave the city limits, Spike gradually grows attached to the city and reconsiders his initial intention to seek out Buffy in Europe.

Lindsey then initiates the next stage of his plan, making Spike corporeal again via what is likely a spell sent in a package to Spike at Wolfram & Hart. He later seeks out Spike under the assumed identity of a drifter named Doyle, closely paralleling the initial encounters between Angel and the real Doyle. Claiming to receive visions from the Powers That Be, he gains Spike's cooperation and trust.

Lindsey and Eve contrive a situation where Spike saves Angel from a demonic parasite (placed on an unconscious Angel by Eve), which simultaneously disheartens Angel, galvanizes Spike, and adds weight and veracity to the claims made by 'Doyle'/Lindsey. Although the 'mind numbing' visions that Lindsey reports are non-existent, the events described (whether revealed to Lindsey through mundane or arcane means) are true, and for a time, Spike does appear the far more likely candidate to fulfill the Shanshu Prophecy.

However, when Cordelia seemingly returns to life, it throws a monkey wrench in Lindsey's plans. Lindsey sends Spike to kill her, not expecting him to succeed, but it "was worth a shot." Meanwhile, he infiltrates Wolfram & Hart. When informed by Eve that Spike had failed, Lindsey activates the Senior Partners' program meant to kill Angel if he turned against them. The plan is averted though as Spike, Cordelia, and Angel are able to uncover Lindsey's actions.

Angel and Lindsey face off in the chamber where the "contingency plan" is stored. The pair fight on a rising container, that holds the creature meant to kill Angel while Cordelia tries to stop the process. Lindsey displays the new abilities he has learned on his journeys, enabling him to keep up with Angel in a physical confrontation. Despite this, Angel finally defeats Lindsey, informing him that, no matter what he tries, he (Angel) will always beat the bad guys, and his comrades are able to dissolve the tattoos that protect Lindsey from the Senior Partners' wrath.

Lindsey is incarcerated in a hell dimension which emulates suburbia, complete with a wife and son. Time operates in a loop; each day he has his heart cut out by a demon hiding in the house's basement, reminiscent of the myth of Prometheus. He is eventually rescued by Angel, Spike, and Charles Gunn for information they need. They are only able to leave by the sacrifice of Gunn, who remains behind to take Lindsey's place.

Lindsey later reveals that his plot to kill Angel was also meant to make him a member of the Circle of the Black Thorn, the Senior Partners' instrument on this plane of existence, a secret society devoted to maintaining man's inhumanity to man in exchange for power. He notes that while Angel is sidetracked at Wolfram & Hart, the Apocalypse is already underway, and Angel and his team are becoming more and more corrupt by the day.

Lindsey and Angel ally once more in an effort to stop the Circle. The two agree to fight the upcoming battle together and at the end, resolve their differences, maybe even allowing Lindsey to take a powerful position at Wolfram & Hart as "the devil they know." At least that is the plan.

Lindsey destroys the Sahrvin demon clan with Lorne's assistance as planned. However, Angel believes that Lindsey can never be trusted and that he will never be a force for good. Consequently, Angel secretly instructs Lorne to assassinate Lindsey after the Sahrvin are defeated. Taking two bullets in the chest, as Lorne informs Lindsey that he will never be a part of the solution, a stunned Lindsey staggers back and slumps down by a wall, outraged and humiliated at being killed by (in his own words) a "flunky," rather than his nemesis, Angel.

Powers and abilities.
Thanks to an unrevealed mystical process, Lindsey became gifted with strength, speed, and endurance on a par with Angel as well as rune tattoos meant to hide him from all known surveillance methods other than the naked eye. He was also capable of transmuting a small blade into a sword and was an adept swordsman. In addition, Lindsey had telekinetic abilities. Until the removal of his strumming hand, he was also a competent guitarist.

Trivia.
 Lindsey is the only character besides Angel himself to appear in both the first and last episodes of Angel.
 Christian Kane originally auditioned for the role of Riley Finn on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
 In "You're Welcome," Lindsey calls Angel a corporate puppet. Two episodes later, Angel does literally become a puppet in the episode "Smile Time.";
 Christian Kane lends his real singing voice to the episode "Dead End," causing a humorous and seemingly jealous reaction by Angel in Caritas.
 Though Christian Kane is a guitar player as well as a singer, it is his KANE band mate Steve Carlson that lends his hands for the performance shots during the Caritas scene in "Dead End.";
 The fleur-de-lis bracelet that Lindsey wears throughout his time on the show is actually a bracelet that Christian Kane wears to remind him of his mother who is from New Orleans.

"Bitter Work" is an episode from the animated television series , which airs on Nickelodeon. It is the ninth episode of the second season of the series.

When Aang struggles with a block while trying to learn earthbending from Toph, he wonders if the problem is with him or his teacher.  Meanwhile, Sokka gets himself in a jam.

 Episode synopsis .

Aang awakes from his sleep, excited that he will finally begin his earthbending training with Toph. He enthusiastically asks her what they will do first, and Toph replies that they will simply learn how to move a rock.

Toph teaches Aang that earthbending requires a firm, steady stance. She demonstrates the technique by sending a rock into a wall.  Aang tries to emulate her, but he ends up hitting the rock with airbending and propels himself backwards.

Meanwhile, Iroh awakes to find his nephew Zuko watching over him. Zuko explains that Iroh was knocked unconscious after a surprise attack by Azula. They are in a partially destroyed home in the abandoned town presented the end of the last episode.

Zuko says that he has contemplated and realized that he will eventually encounter Azula again. He wants to learn more advanced firebending techniques so he can defeat her. To Zuko's surprise, Iroh agrees with him.

Meanwhile, Aang is trying to figure out why he could not move the rock, since he did the correct stance. He tries to find an alternate solution, but Toph explains that creative thinking is the problem. Earthbending requires a head-on approach. Aang then trains by doing several activities involving rocks. He starts to become successful with the many different training activities.

Meanwhile, Sokka (who is alone) is hiding in a tree. He spots a small, cute, but unidentifiable creature. Sokka comically states that even though it is cute, it is still made of meat. He then jumps down from the tree to attack it. However, he falls into a crack in the ground. Without his arms to use, he is stuck in the crack.

Meanwhile, Iroh explains how Firebenders can create lightning. Lightning requires peace of mind; it does not use aggression, unlike the other forms of firebending.


Iroh continues to explain how to create lightning. Positive energy and negative energy must be separated, creating an imbalance.  (Possibly the positively and negatively charged protons and electrons.) When the different energies recombine, tension is released, creating lightning. He successfully demonstrates how to make lightning. Then Zuko tries to create it. However, he just creates a fire blast and flies backwards., similar to the way Aang made an air blast while trying to earthbend.

Meanwhile, Toph decides that Aang will stop a rock. Toph puts a blindfold around Aang's eyes and rolls a boulder down a steep hill towards him.  Aang then flinches and jumps over the rock. Toph yells at Aang and calls him a wimp. Katara tries to console Aang by teaching him some more waterbending.

Zuko is still unsuccessful with lightning, creating another explosion. Iroh determines that Zuko's turmoil inside him is preventing him from creating lightning. Zuko still has some pride, even though he has been humbled.  Iroh decides to teach Zuko a move that he made up himself.

Meanwhile, Sokka is contemplating in the crack in the ground. He is then convinced that he will be a vegetarian if he can escape out of the crack.

In a marsh, Aang is moving a small mass of water with Katara. She tries to tell Aang to face the issue instead of avoiding it.  Aang, however, is unable to do that. Katara explains that Aang is working with his opposite element, earth. Katara then surprises Aang by throwing a reed at him. Aang is able to use water to cut the reed into two pieces before it reaches him. Katara congratulates Aang for having reflexes of a master Waterbender and Aang replies to her as Sifu (teacher) Katara.

Iroh gives further detail about the four nations to Zuko. The Fire Nation symbolizes power and desire, the Earth Kingdom symbolizes endurance and diversity, the Air Nomads symbolize freedom from worldly concerns, and the Water Tribes symbolize love and community, especially in the face of change. He explains that people can gain wisdom by understanding each other. Iroh learned his special move by understanding the Waterbenders.

Meanwhile, Toph taunts Aang about his submissiveness by abusing his staff. She walks away, but Katara arrives, saying that Sokka has not been found yet. Aang and Katara split up to search for Sokka.

Sokka is ready to give up meat and sarcasm in order to escape from the crack in the ground. This is proven to be hypocrisy when Aang finds him, and Sokka immediately asks Aang if he has any meat, and responds to Aang's inability to free him with sarcasm. Aang tries, but is unable to use airbending to free him. Sokka requests that he should get Toph to help, but Aang feels too scared to ask her for help. Consequently, Sokka remains in the hole.

The critter returns, and Aang identifies it as a saber-tooth moose-lion cub. Then the mother of the cub arrives, and she is furious.

Iroh begins to teach Zuko how to redirect lightning. Lightning goes through one arm, into the stomach, and out the other arm. They practice the hand motion to feel the pathway. When Zuko thinks he has mastered it, he demands that Uncle Iroh strike him with lightning. However, Iroh refuses because of the possibility of hurting his nephew. Zuko then leaves to "find his own lightning", as a storm is approaching.

The mother sabertooth moose-lion starts to attack Aang and Sokka. Aang tries to initially avoid it, but he eventually faces the mother head-on and sends her away. Toph, who was silently observing the conflict, congratulates Aang, but Aang demands that she give his staff back. Toph then says that Aang is thinking like an Earthbender. Aang successfully earthbends a rock. Toph then drags Sokka out of the hole.

Aang, Toph, and Sokka find Katara, who is relieved that Sokka has been found.

At the end of the episode, Zuko stands atop a mountain, yelling into the storm as the lightning crackles overhead. He dares the storm to strike him, in the hope of being able to practice what his uncle just taught him and, in some way, seek an end to his misery. But the storm, seeming to mock him, does not oblige. Zuko, who suddenly sheds a tear, falls to his knees crying out in anguish.

 Notes .
 Iroh's son, Lu Ten, is seen for the first time.
 Toph's delivery of, "Good Morning, Earthbending Student!" is crooned in the same way as Adrian Cronauer's "Good Morning, Vietnam!" ;
 It is confirmed that Iroh is able to create lightning. Iroh's explanation of how firebending creates lightning -- that is, by separation of positive and negative energy -- closely matches the scientific explanation for how lightning is actually formed, through separation of positive and negative charges.
 Aang Earthbends for the first time outside of the Avatar State, and has now Bended all four elements.
 Iroh mentions that in order to redirect lightning, it must be channeled from one arm through the stomach to the other arm.  Having it flow through the heart can be very dangerous, even fatal.  This is scientifically true, where electricity can be used to start or stop the heart during cardiac arrest.
 Iroh invented his redirection of lighting technique through his studies of the Waterbenders and their ability to deal with the flow of energy. His description of the "sea of chi" during his explanation of the technique is drawn directly from the Taoist practices of Chi Kung and Tai Chi, on which waterbending is based.
 When Zuko weeps at the end of the episode, his scarred eye does not shed any tears.  It is interesting to note that when his healthy eye opens all the way, the scarred one remains still, but when Zuko closes his right eye, the left shuts evenly with it.  This suggests that the scar has affected his tear duct and eyelid muscle, rather than just his skin.
 The diagram that Iroh draws into the ground presents each of the elements and arranges them in opposing forces.  Water is the opposite of Fire and Air is the opposite of Earth.  It is important to recognize that the bottom two elements, Air and Fire, are mainly identified with emotions.  The top two elements, Earth and Water, represent worldly attributes of intrepidity and community, respectively.
 Katara's and Toph's teaching styles are both defined in this episode as two of the four consequences of operant conditioning. Katara suggests to Toph that her use of positive reinforcement has helped Aang. Toph, however, uses negative punishment in order to change Aang's attitude.
 Aang addresses Toph and later Katara as "Sifu," which means "teacher" in Cantonese. It is most commonly used in martial arts schools.

The Russian apartment bombings were a series of bombings in Russia that killed nearly 300 people and led the country into the Second Chechen War. They happened over a span of two weeks in 1999. The Russian authorities, directed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, blamed the bombings on Chechen separatists, and, in response, ordered the invasion of Chechnya. However, former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, Johns Hopkins University and Hoover Institute scholar David Satter , and Russian lawmaker Sergei Yushenkov asserted that the bombings were in fact a "false flag" attack perpetrated by the FSB in order to legitimate the resumption of military activities in Chechnya and bring Vladimir Putin and FSB to power.

The bombings.
The first bombing, which did not target an apartment, occurred in Moscow, the Russian capital, on August 31, 1999. A bomb exploded in a mall, killing one person and leaving 40 others wounded. A note was left saying the bombing was a result of increasing Russian consumerism.

Buynaksk.
On September 4, 1999, a car bomb detonated outside an apartment building housing Russian soldiers in the city of Buynaksk, in the province of Dagestan. Sixty-four people were killed and dozens of others were wounded. Russia blamed separatists from Chechnya, and days later invaded the province of Dagestan.

Moscow, Pechatniki.
On September 8, 1999, 300 kg to 400 kg of explosives detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast Moscow. The nine-story building was destroyed, killing 94 people inside and wounded 150 others. A total of 108 apartments were destroyed during the bombing. A caller to a Russian news agency said the blast was a response to recent Russian bombing of Chechen and Dagestan villages in response to the invasion of Dagestan.

Moscow, Kashirskoye highway.
September 13, 1999, was supposed to be a day of mourning for the victims of the previous bomb attacks. But on that day, a large bomb exploded at an apartment on Kashirskoye Highway in southern Moscow. The eight-story building was flattened, littering the street with debris and throwing some concrete hundreds of yards away. In all, 118 people died and 200 were wounded.

It was at this time when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin declared a war against the "illegal military units" in Chechnya. Though there was not much evidence pointing to Chechens, preparations were made by the Russian military forces to re-enter the province and to strip the Chechen government of its powers.

Volgodonsk.
The motive for the forceful solution was clinched when a truck bomb exploded September 16, 1999, outside a nine-story apartment complex in the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, killing 17 people.

In response, Russia launched air strikes on Chechen rebel positions, oil refineries, and other buildings inside that province. By the end of September it was clear another war over Chechnya was underway, and by October Russian troops had entered the province. The attacks would not be the last in Russia or Chechnya.

Ryazan incident.

 On the evening of September 22, 1999, an alert resident of an apartment building in the town of Ryazan noticed strangers moving heavy sugar sacks into the basement from a car.  Militia (the local police) were called to the site and all residents were evacuated.  The first test of the powder from the sacks showed the presence of an explosive.  All roads from the town were brought under heavy surveillance but no leads were found.  A telephone service employee tapped into long-distance phone conversations managed to detect a conversation in which an out-of-town person suggested to take care and to watch for patrols.  That person's number was found to belong to an FSB office in Moscow.



Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti declared that the incident was a training exercise forty-eight hours later.  The original chemical test was declared inaccurate due to contamination of the analysis apparatus from a previous test.  The public inquiry committee could not come to a complete conclusion on this and other incidents due to incoherent answers from federal bodies.  The General Prosecutor's office has closed the criminal investigation of the Ryazan incident in April 2000.

Official investigation.
According to the official investigation , the apartment bombings were planned and organized by Amir Khattab and Abu Umar, Arab militants fighting in Chechnya on the side of Chechen insurgents, both of whom were later killed. The planning was carried out in Khattab's guerilla camps in Chechnya, "Caucasus" in Shatoy and "Taliban" in Avtury.

This particular operation was led by an ethnic Karachay Achemez Gochiyayev. The explosives were prepared in Urus-Martan, Chechnya at the fertilizer factory by mixing hexogen, TNT, aluminium powder and nitre with sugar.  From there they have been sent to a food storage facility in Kislovodsk which was managed by an uncle of one of the terrorists, Yusuf Krymshakhalov. Another conspirator, Ruslan Magayayev, had leased a KamAZ truck which the sacks were stored in for two months.  After everything was planned, the participants were organized into several groups which transported the explosives to different cities. Most of the people participating were not ethnic Chechens.

According to official version, the following people either delivered explosives, stored them, or harbored other suspects:

Moscow bombings.
 Achemez Gochiyayev (has not been arrested);
 Denis Saitakov (killed in Chechnya);
 Khakim Abayev (killed by FSB special forces in May 2004 in Ingushetia);
 Ravil Akhmyarov (killed in Chechnya);
 Yusuf Krymshakhalov (arrested in Georgia, extradited to Russia and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2004);

Volgodonsk bombing.
 Timur Batchayev (killed in Georgia in the clash with police during which Krymshakhalov was arrested);
 Zaur Batchayev (killed in Chechnya);
 Adam Dekkushev (arrested in Georgia, threw a grenade at police during the arrest, extradited to Russia and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 2004);

Buinaksk bombing.
 Isa Zainutdinov (sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2001);
 Alisultan Salikhov (sentenced to life imprisonment in March 2001);
 Magomed Salikhov (arrested in Azerbaijan in November 2004, extradited to Russia, found not guilty on the charge of terrorism by the jury on January 24, 2006; found guilty on other related charges such as participating in an illegal armed force and illegal crossing of the national border, the Supreme Court has found some procedural issues with that decision and decided that a retrial was necessary, but on November 13, 2006 he was again found not guilty, this time on all charges, including the ones he was found guilty of in the first trial);
 Ziyavutdin Ziyavutdinov (arrested in Kazakhstan, extradited to Russia, sentenced to 24 years in April 2002);
 Abdulkadyr Abdulkadyrov (sentenced to 9 years in March 2001);
 Magomed Magomedov (sentenced to 9 years in March 2001);
 Zainutdin Zainutdinov (sentenced to 3 years in March 2001 and immediately released under amnesty);
 Makhach Abdulsamedov (sentenced to 3 years in March 2001 and immediately released under amnesty).

Attempts at independent investigation.

The Russian Duma rejected two motions for parliamentary investigation of the Ryazan incident. Duma, on a pro-Kremlin party block vote, voted to seal all materials related to Ryazan incident for the next 75 years and forbade an investigation of what really happened. An independent public commission to investigate the bombings chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalev was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries.  Two key members of the Kovalev Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, both Duma members, have since died in apparent assassinations in April 2003 and July 2003 respectively.  The Commission's lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin has been arrested in October 2003 to become one of the better-known political prisoners in Russia.  Another member of the commission, Otto Lacis, was brutally beaten in November 2003 and two years later on 3rd of November 2005 dies in the hospital after a car accident.

Theory of FSB involvement.
The Ryazan incident on September 22, 1999 prompted the initial speculation in the Western press that the Moscow bombings were organized by the FSB, the Russian domestic intelligence service. 

The FSB were caught by local police and citizens in the city of Ryazan planting a bomb with a detonator in the basement of an apartment building at the address of 14/16 Novosyelov on the night of September 22, 1999. Explosives experts arriving at the scene found that the bomb tested positive for hexogen (i.e., RDX). On September 24, 1999, Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the FSB, said on the NTV channel that the bomb in the basement of the apartment had been a dummy and that the FSB had been conducting a test. The FSB claimed that the gas analyzer that detected hexogen had malfunctioned, and that the substance in the dummy bomb was sugar.

Yet, Yuri Tkachenko, the explosives expert who defused the bomb insisted that it was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, power source, and detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyzer that tested the vapors coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of hexogen. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyzer could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyzer was of world class quality, costing $20,000 and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyzer after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyzer was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad's experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.  The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that the incident was not an exercise and that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.

Alexander Litvinenko, a former FSB agent, alleged that agents from the FSB co-ordinated the apartment block bombings. On 29 December 2003 Russian authorities confiscated over 5000 copies of the book en route to Moscow from the publisher in Latvia.. Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London in November 2006.

Boris Berezovsky supported a documentary film "FSB blows up Russia" ("An assault on Russia"?), financing 25% of the costs. The film accused Russian special services of organising the explosions in Volgodonsk and Moscow. According to research carried out by two French journalists, Jean-Charles Deniau and Charles Gazelle, the explosions were carried out by FSB to provide justification for the continuance of the Chechen War, which in turn helped Putin beat the communists in the presidential election of 2000. There is some doubt concerning Berezovsky's impartiality in this case, as he allegedly had extensive business dealings with Chechen rebels. However, nearly 40% of the Russians gave credence to Berezovsky's accusations at the time

In April 2002 on a visit to Washington, Duma member Sergei Yushenkov pointed to a mysterious remark by the Duma speaker Gennady Seleznev, from which it  appeared that Seleznev had known about one of the explosions three days before the fact. In fact, Seleznyov was referring to an unrelated explosion which indeed happened in Volgodonsk three days earlier.

An independent documentary 'Nedoverie" (Disbelief) about the bombing controversy by Russian director Andrei Nekrasov was premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. The film chronicles the story of Tatyana and Alyona Morozova, the two Russian-American sisters, who had lost their mother in the attack, and decided to find out who did it.

On May 20, 2004, an article in the Los Angeles Times  described the conviction on an unrelated state secret charge of Mikhail Trepashkin, appointed by a public committee, set up by four members of the Russian parliament, to investigate the  bombings. Trepashkin was arrested shortly before he was to make his findings public. The article states that FSB agent Vladimir Romanovich was identified by several witnesses as the man who rented the basement of one of the bombed buildings; Romanovich subsequently died in a car crash in Cyprus.  Trepashkin's wife declared that his conviction was punishment for publicizing uncomfortable truths about the bombing. 

On 18 January 2003 Yuri Felshtinsky provided Novaya Gazeta with a video recording and its transcript.  computer translation  The video dated 20 August 2002 contained an interview with somebody claimed to be Gochiyayev.  The authors edited out the names of an FSB agent and another person from the interviewee's story.  The authors asked for money in exchange for the missing details.

In February 2005 Yuri Felshtinsky received an audio cassette and a written statement from an unnamed mediator without pay.  The statement made by Gochiyayev or orchestrated by his kidnappers said that he was just an unknowing participant in a plot organized by an undercover FSB agent, his former acquaintance Ramazan Dyshekov. computer translation  This story contradicted the name of the FSB agent Vladimir Romanovich disclosed by Trepashkin one day before his arrest.  computer translation

Among Western scholars, the theory of FSB involvement in the bombings has been championed by David Satter, the former Financial Times correspondent in Moscow, in his book Darkness at Dawn: the Rise of the Russian Criminal State ISBN 0-300-09892-8, published by  Yale University Press.

Reistingen Abbey (Kloster Reistingen) was a house of Augustinian canonesses, previously a Benedictine monastery, at Ziertheim in Bavaria.

History.
The monastery was founded at some time before 1250 by the Counts of Dillingen. In the 14th century it was dedicated to Saint Peter; the present church is dedicated to Saints Peter and Vitus. Until at least the middle of the 13th century it was a Benedictine monastery, but changed to a house of Augustinian canonesses in either the 13th or 14th century. In 1450 Pope Nicholas V abolished the foundation and diverted the income to the use of the Bishop of Augsburg, in whose diocese it was. In 1465 the bishop used part of the income to buy liturgical books for the court chapel at Dillingen. The monastic and foundation church became the parish church.

Quang Tri (in Vietnamese Qu ng Tr  ) is a province in the North Central Coast of Vietnam, next to the former capital of Hu . This is where the southernmost Chinese commandery of Rinan was centred during the Later Han dynasty (25-220 CE).

This province was the northernmost province of the former Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) which ceased to exist after the end of the Vietnam War.

Its capital is Dong Ha.  Another notable city is Quang Tri.  The most notable achievement of the North Vietnamese offensive in 1972 was capturing Quang Tri.

In 2000, Clear Path International (CPI) was still working to remove unexploded ordnance left by the United States in Quang Tri Province. This was at the time the largest unexploded ordnance removal effort by an NGO in Vietnam's history.  CPI continues to operate in Quang Tri, providing victim assistance to those injured by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO).

In 2006, Mines Advisory Group (MAG) continues to operate in Quang Tri (and neighbouring Quang Binh) province, providing the only civilian staffed demining and UXO clearance operations in Vietnam.

Sandy Bay is a suburb of the city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.  It is immediately south of the CBD.  It is in the local government area of City of Hobart.

The area is generally known as one of the city's more prestigious suburbs, with many large and extravagant homes and apartment blocks.  It adjoins the waterfront Salamanca area as well as nearby prestige suburb of Battery Point.  However, it is also the site of the Hobart campus of the University of Tasmania, Fahan School and The Hutchins School, and as a result has a large student population.

Sandy Bay is accessible via Sandy Bay Road, which runs from Davey Street in the city all the way to the Kingborough municipal boundary at Taroona when it becomes the Channel Highway.  Before the construction of the Southern Outlet, the road was the primary route to and from Kingston.  It is also accessible via Regent Street, which bypasses the shopping district and goes direct to the University.

Australia's first legal casino, Wrest Point Hotel Casino, was opened in 1973 at the site of the former Wrest Point Riviera hotel.

The part of Sandy Bay located at the far southern end is generally known as Lower Sandy Bay.

Sandy Bay is also home to many beaches on the Derwent River, including Nutgrove Beach.

Wax paper (also called waxed paper) is a kind of paper that is made moisture proof through the application of wax.


The paper was invented in 1872 by Thomas Edison when he was 25 years old. It is commonly used in cooking (for non-stick properties) and wrapping food for storage (keeps water out or in). It is also used in arts and crafts.

Similar to 'baking paper' and 'greaseproof paper'.

 Food Preparation .

Oven: While wax paper should never be exposed to direct heat (paper is flammable), it can and is used safely in numerous baking applications. In baking quick breads or cakes, a pan can be lined with wax paper in such a way that the batter completely covers the surface of the wax paper lining. This will prevent the bread or cake from sticking to the pan in the lined area, aiding in removal of the baked product.

Microwave: Wax paper can function as a splatter cover in microwave cooking. Because the paper is mostly unaffected by microwaves, it will not heat to the point of combustion under normal usage. This makes wax paper more functional than cling wrap which will melt at lower temperatures, or aluminum foil (or tin foil) which will block microwaves, preventing the covered foodstuff from heating.

 Other Uses .
The paper is also used in the manufacture of some less expensive models of the musical instrument the kazoo. One can make a simple kazoo by combining a small piece of wax paper and a comb, then blowing over it.

Another use of wax paper is to apply wax to objects. By rubbing the wax paper on an object the wax will rub off the paper and onto the object. This is useful for adding a slight polish or to reduce friction.

Newer projects with wax paper include three dimensional forms which are very suitable for such objects as disposable cups. Developed by Sam Hecht from Industrial Facility .

A Horse's Neck is an IBA Official Cocktail. It is made with Brandy (or sometimes rye whisky or bourbon) and ginger ale, with a long spiral of lemon peel draped over the edge of an old fashioned or highball glass.

Origins.
Dating back to the 1890's, it was a non-alcoholic mixture of ginger ale, ice and lemon peel. By the 1910's, Brandy, sometimes Bourbon would be added for a 'Horse's Neck with a Kick' or '~ Stiff'. Eventually, the non-alcoholic version became phased out.

For the Australian rules footballer, see James Walker (Australian rules footballer).;


James Barry Walker (born July 9, 1973 in Sutton-in-Ashfield) is a professional English association football player. Walker, a goalkeeper, plays for Premiership outfit, West Ham United, wearing squad number 23.

The London club acquired his services from Walsall on a Bosman free transfer in the summer of 2004. Walker is a cult hero at the Bescot Stadium, having made over 400 appearances for the Midlands club. He was awarded a testimonial in the summer of 2003. Whilst at Walsall he was a key player in three promotion seasons, and won their Player of the Season award twice. He is best known for his agility and ability to make world-class saves which defy his diminutive goalkeeper's frame of 5'11".

Indeed, Walker's popularity proved such that an autobiography was commissioned to coincide with his testimonial season. Ghosted by Walsall F.C. programme editor, Andrew Poole, it proved to be a relative success with fans of Walsall and of West Ham United

He is nicknamed "Wacka" because of the distance of his goal kicks, a variation on his life-long family nickname of "Wack".

Walker was the second choice goalkeeper at Upton Park, but gained a first team place within the year of his arrival.  A serious injury in the Play-off final of 2005 saw him miss the majority of the 2005/06 season.  Walker made a quick return to fitness, and made three appearances in the 2005-06 seasons, making his Premiership debut at the age of 32. He also picked up a loser's medal in the FA Cup Final as an unused substitute. The presence of Roy Carroll and Robert Green as goalkeepers at West Ham means that Walker's first-team chances are currently limited, though he remains very popular at Upton Park.

He is married and has one son.

<doc id="16736" title="Kurt Gödel" nonfiltered="198" processed="197" dbindex="450198">


Kurt Gödel (IPA: ) (April 28, 1906 Brno, then Austria-Hungary, now Czech Republic   January 14, 1978 Princeton, New Jersey) was an Austrian logician, mathematician, and philosopher of mathematics.

One of the most significant logicians of all time, Gödel's work has had immense impact upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when many, such as Bertrand Russell, A. N. Whitehead and David Hilbert, were attempting to use logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics.

Gödel is best known for his two incompleteness theorems, published in 1931 when he was 25 years of age, and only one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna. The more famous incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms. To prove this theorem, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers.

He also showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory, if those axioms are consistent. He made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.

 Life .
 Childhood .
Kurt Friedrich Gödel was born April 28, 1906, in Brno (German: Brünn), Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic) into the ethnic German family of Rudolf Gödel, the manager of a textile factory, and Marianne Gödel (born Handschuh). At the time of his birth the town had a slight German-speaking majority and this was the language of his parents. 

He automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian empire broke up at the end of World War I. He later told his biographer John D. Dawson that he felt like an "exiled Austrian in Czechoslovakia" ("ein österreichischer Verbannter in Tschechoslowakien") during this time. He was never able to speak Czech and refused to learn it at school. He became an Austrian citizen by choice at age 23. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria, Gödel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II, at the age of 42, he became a naturalized American citizen.

In his family, young Kurt was known as Der Herr Warum ("Mr. Why") because of his insatiable curiosity.
According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage.

He attended German language primary and secondary school in Brno and completed them with honors in 1923. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna (UV). During his teens, Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand, Goethe's Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.

 Studying in Vienna .
At the age of 18, Kurt joined his brother Rudolf in Vienna and entered the UV. By that time he had already mastered university-level mathematics. Although initially intending to study theoretical physics, Kurt also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. During this time, he adopted ideas of mathematical realism.  He read Kant's Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft, and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap. Kurt then studied number theory, but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell's book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, Kurt became interested in mathematical logic.

Attending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set Gödel's life course. 
In 1928, Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik (Principles of Theoretical Logic), an introduction to first-order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed: Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?
This was the topic chosen by Gödel for his doctorate work.
In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, Gödel established the completeness of the first-order predicate calculus (this result is known as Gödel's completeness theorem). He was awarded the doctorate in 1930. His thesis, along with some additional work, was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.

 Working in Vienna .
In 1931, Gödel published his famous incompleteness theorems in "Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme." In that article, he proved that for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (e.g. the Peano axioms or ZFC), then:
 The system cannot be both consistent and complete. (This is generally known as the incompleteness theorem.);
 The consistency of the axioms cannot be proved within the system.  ;
These theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of Frege and culminating in Principia Mathematica and  Hilbert's formalism, to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics. The incompleteness theorems also imply that not all mathematical questions are computable.

In hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. Gödel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false, which contradicts the fact that provable statements are always true.
Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement.
That is, for any humanly constructible set of axioms for arithmetic, there is a formula which obtains in arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system.
To make this precise, however, Gödel needed to solve several technical issues, such as encoding statements, proofs, and the very concept of provability into the natural numbers. He did this using a process known as Gödel numbering.

Gödel earned his habilitation at the UV in 1932, and in 1933 he became a Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer) there. Hitler's 1933 ascension in Germany had little effect on Gödel in Vienna, as he took little interest in politics. He was, however, much affected by the 1936 murder of Moritz Schlick (whose seminar had aroused Gödel's interest in logic) by a deranged student, which resulted in Gödel's first nervous breakdown.

 Visits to the USA .
In 1933, Gödel first traveled to the USA, where he met Albert Einstein who became a good friend. He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society. During this year, Gödel also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he delivered a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using Gödel numbering.

In 1934 Gödel gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, entitled On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems. Stephen Kleene, who had just completed his Ph.D. at Princeton, took notes of these lectures which have been subsequently published.

Gödel would visit the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The traveling and the hard work had exhausted him and the next year he had to recover from a depression. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis; he would go on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.

He married Adele Nimbursky (née Porkert), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938.
Their relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he.
They had no children.

Subsequently, he left for another visit to the USA, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and the spring of 1939 at the University of Notre Dame.

 Princeton .
After the Anschluss in 1938, Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany.
Germany abolished the title of Privatdozent, so Gödel had to apply for a different position under the new order; his former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him.
His predicament precipitated when he was found fit for military service and was now at risk of being conscripted into the German army.
World War II started in September 1939.
In January 1940, Gödel and his wife left Europe.  Due to the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, they took the trans-Siberian railway and passed through Japan en route to the U.S.. Arriving in San Francisco, California on March 4, 1940, they crossed the U.S. by train so that Gödel could take up a position at the IAS in Princeton, New Jersey.

Gödel very quickly resumed his mathematical work. In 1940, he published his work Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory which is a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the constructible universe, a model of set theory in which the only sets which exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gödel showed that both the axiom of choice (AC) and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the Zermelo-Frankel axioms for set theory (ZF). Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory. 

During his many years at the Institute, Gödel's interests turned to philosophy and physics. He studied and admired the works of Gottfried Leibniz, but came around to the (unsupported) belief that most of Leibniz's works had been suppressed.  To a lesser extent he studied Kant and Edmund Husserl. In the early 1970s, Gödel circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz's ontological proof of God's existence. This is now known as Gödel's ontological proof.

In the late 1940s, Gödel demonstrated the existence of paradoxical solutions to Albert Einstein's field equations in general relativity. These "rotating universes" would allow time travel and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. 

Gödel became a permanent member of the IAS in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work.  He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976. 

Gödel was awarded (with Julian Schwinger) the first Albert Einstein Award, in 1951, and was also awarded the National Medal of Science, in 1974.

Psychological disorder.
Gödel was shy, withdrawn and eccentric. He would wear warm, winter clothing in the middle of summer. In the middle of winter, he would leave all of the windows open in his home because he believed that conspirators were trying to assassinate him with poison gas. He was a somewhat sickly man and was prescribed specific diets and medical regimens by doctors, but Gödel often ignored their advice, or even would do the opposite of what his prescription indicated. This caused him to suffer further illness.
In the 1940s he suffered from a bleeding ulcer, but his distrust of doctors led him to delay treatment; he risked death and was saved only by emergency blood transfusion.

Amongst his delusions was the belief that unknown villains were trying to kill him by poisoning his food. For this reason, Gödel would only eat his wife's cooking, refusing to even eat his own cooking for fear of being poisoned.

Death.
Late in 1977, Adele became incapacitated due to illness and so could no longer cook for Gödel. Due to his paranoia, he refused to eat any food at all and thus died of "malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance" in Princeton Hospital on January 14, 1978.  He weighed 65 pounds.

Legacy.
The Kurt Gödel Society, founded in 1987, was named in his honor. It is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic, philosophy, and the history of mathematics.

Gödel's friendship with Einstein.


Gödel had a most distinguished coach for his citizenship exam: Albert Einstein, who had earlier earned his own citizenship and who was concerned that his friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his chances.  Einstein accompanied Gödel to the hearing.  To everyone's consternation, Gödel suddenly informed the presiding judge that he had discovered a way in which a dictatorship could be legally installed in the United States, through a logical contradiction in the U.S. Constitution.  Fortunately, the judge, who was apparently a very patient person, took this in good part and awarded Gödel his citizenship. (See .)

Einstein and Gödel had a legendary friendship, shared in the walks they took together to and from the Institute for Advanced Studies. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist Oskar Morgenstern recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that "his own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel".

Ernest Callenbach (born April 3, 1929) is an American writer.

Born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, he attended the University of Chicago, where he was drawn into the then 'new wave' of serious attention to film as an art form. After six months in Paris at the Sorbonne, watching four films a day, he returned to Chicago and earned a Master s degree in English and Communications.

Callenbach then moved to California. From 1955 to 1991, he was on the staff of the University of California Press (Berkeley).  A general copywriter for a number of years, he edited the Press's Film Quarterly  from 1958 until 1991.  He also occasionally taught film courses at U.C. and at San Francisco State University. 

For many years Callenbach edited the Natural History Guides at the U.C. Press.  He began to take environmental issues and their connections to human value systems, social patterns, and lifestyles just as seriously as he had taken film. He is therefore known as an author of green books, namely as author of the ecological utopias Ecotopia (1975) and Ecotopia Emerging (1981). He is said to have coined the word "ecotopia."

In terms of concepts of human involvement with the ecology, as well as some of the economic and social concepts, the Ecotopia books are related to what is known as the sustainability movement.   Callenbach s Ecotopian concept is not "Luddite"   he does not reject high technology, but rather his fictional society shows a conscious selectivity about technology.  As an example, with its emphasis on personal rather than impersonal interaction, Callenbach s Ecotopian society anticipates the development and liberal usage of videoconferencing.

Indeed, for all his involvement with print publications, Callenbach remained quite interested in visual media.  Aspects of his book Ecotopia in some ways anticipated "reality TV"   which emerged into recognition, and was given a label as a genre, 20 or more years later   because in the story the daily life of the legislature and some of that of the judicial courts is televised in this fictional society, and televised debates (including technical debates concerning ecological problems) met a need and desire among citizens.

Callenbach has been a part of the circle of West Coast technologists, architects, social thinkers, and scientists which has included such people as Ursula K. Le Guin, Starhawk (Miriam Simos), Sim Van der Ryn, Peter Calthorpe, Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, J. Baldwin, and John Todd.  As with a number of these others, he has been a speaker, discussion panellist, and essayist.

Recently, Callenbach has introduced the story of a real-world community movement in Japan that is reminiscent, in its aims and practices, of his Ecotopian society.  He visited Japan and investigated the Yamagishi movement.  It encompasses some three dozen intentional communities founded on the same underlying principles: living an ecologically based integration of people with agriculture (pig, cattle, and chicken livestock rasing, and organic-vegetable and fruit farming), and living a social life based on principles of democracy, mutual understanding, support, and health.  Each individual settlement is referred to as jikkenji ( demonstration community for the world ).

Chloroprene is the common name for the organic compound 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene, which has the chemical formula C4H5Cl.  The chemical structure is shown at right.  It is used as monomer for the production of the polymer polychloroprene, a type of synthetic rubber.  Polychloroprene is better known to the public as Neoprene, the trade name DuPont gave it when the company first developed it and currently used by DuPont Dow.  

Production of chloroprene.

The acetylene process was used to produce chloroprene until the 1960s.  In this process, acetylene and hydrogen chloride were used as shown here:

 

This process had disadvantages in that it was very energy-intensive and had high investment costs.  

The modern chloroprene process which is currently used by nearly all makers uses butadiene differently. 1,3-Butadiene undergoes addition of chlorine across one of its double bonds in its molecule to give 3,4-dichloro-1-butene.  Then this compound undergoes an elimination of a hydrogen atom in the #3 position and the chlorine atom in the #4 position as HCl forming a double bond between the #3 and #4 carbon atoms in the molecule, yielding chloroprene.

 History of Mark Twain .

In 1972 the NAACP brought suit in Hart V. Community School Board 21 in
the U.S. District Court, charging that Mark Twain Junior High School 239
was unconstitutionally segregated. The school is located in Coney
Island, a predominantly Black and Hispanic section of the school
district and in fact had about an 85% percent minority enrollment. Judge
Weinstein found the plaintiffs were correct in that the school was
unconstitutionally segregated.

The remedy plan proposed by the NAACP was developed by Professor Dan
Dodson of New York University and would have compelled the busing of
pupils throughout the district for integration purposes. The school
board plan was to make Mark Twain a magnet school for the gifted and
talented and thus attract sufficient white pupils on a voluntary basis
to integrate the school, and at the same time, all the middle schools in
the district. The plan was the product of more than 150 people
representing a broad spectrum of input from community, parent, District
21 and Brooklyn College professionals.

Judge Weinstein then appointed a master Professor, Curtis Burger of
Columbia University Law School to report back to him with a
recommendation. The recommendation basically was to accept the school
board's plan and the judge so ordered in July of 1974.

Mark Twain Junior High School 239 for the Gifted and Talented opened as
a magnet school effective September 1975 beginning with grade 7, phasing
in grades 8 and 9 over a three year period and was integrated to the
ratio of white pupils to minority pupils in the district which was 7 to
3 at that time.

Children admitted to Mark Twain must meet minimal standards in behavior,
citizenship, attendance, reading, math, and must demonstrate an
identifiable ability or potential in either athletics, art,
computers-mathematics, creative writing, dance, music (strings, vocal,
winds), science, theater or visual media (video and photography).

Mark Twain later converted to its present day Intermediate School
designation (grades 6, 7, 8) but remains organized into mini-schools (we
call them clusters) of four classes with a team of four teachers
assigned to each cluster. Each cluster of teachers is scheduled for a
series of cluster periods during the week with stress on
interdisciplinary planning.

There is no tracking in the school, and classes are heterogeneous and
well integrated. All students study a foreign language and each child is
involved in a talent area in depth. All classes are co-educational
including physical education, technology and home and career skills. No
bells are rung during the day, yet classes change smoothly and
efficiently.

Since 1975, Mark Twain has attracted many applicants for each available
seat. It is recognized by parents and educators throughout the district,
the region, the city and the nation as having successfully achieve its
goal for integration and for providing a meaningful program for the
gifted and talented middle school student.

----

 Mark Twain Today .

Mark Twain is a school with various talents, grouping in a pool of children with different academic or physical abilities. This is a public school deemed one of the best intermediate schools of New York City. A entrance exam must be taken in either a written format or physical actions such as dancing, acting, and playing or showing athletic potential. The different talents include dance talent, drama talent, art talent, athletic talent, science talent, math talent, strings talent, vocal talent, winds talent, media talent, and creative writing talent. Everyone belonging to that school can either belong in one of the talents, but requires two subjects to be taken for the entrance exam. A student passing the exam can only belong in one talent after they get educated within the school. The entrance exam is a higher level fifth grade test (for every subject), which is the grade all students take their exams. After the exam a student must choose a language they want to learn if they get in. 

Mark Twain school has a certain type of way to group the students instead of grades. They use a unit of classification called "clusters." Clusters are groups or classes use to group students. The sixth grade clusters are: 6K, 6L, and 6M. The seventh grade clusters are: 7A, 7B, and 7C. The eighth grade clusters are: 8F, 8G, and 8H. The clusters translate into classes by including a number from 1 to 4, inclusive. For instance, 8G4. The first number represents grade level, the middle letter is the cluster letter, and the last number is simply used as a format to group students in different sections. Certain talents and foreign language belong in different clusters. 
Every year, Mark Twain has schoolwide S.O. Elections to elect officers for the Student Organization (S.O.)
All candidates are required to write up a speech and orally present it to an audience which consists of teachers, staff and students. All students are required to vote for S.O. President, S.O. Secretary, S.O. Treasurer and their own grade's S.O. Vice President. 
Mark Twain is followed by abundants of programs filling the atmosphere. Tennis program, chess program, basketball team, volleyball team, and math team are different after school or competitional programs. 

Honors is a different way to accelerate the learning speed of much talented students in different subjects in Mark Twain. Some students get into honors, but some do not, depending on the overall grade of the marking period. Usually honors are for students having an overall grade of 90 or over for a certain subject. The only subjects you can be in honors are math, science, social studies, and English (excluding talent). Those in honors learn more of have more work to develop on. Classes do not change and periods for the honors and non-honors do not change.
Tutoring is an important factor in school that helps it keep students up to level. If a student is not doing well in class, the subject teacher will call for them to go to tutoring on their normal tutoring schedule. If a student that is doing fine or looks fine to the teacher, but wants to go to tutoring they may also go. All tutoring periods are during lunch. Before a student can go to tutoring, they must get a pass and bag lunch before they head towards their class. Some students are students at higher level that tutor students that attend the tutoring. 

Mid-terms are given out every semester. They are to check up a students grades and see the level they are in. This exam is also graded as a test. Every subject including foreign lanuguage has a mid-term. The mid-term usually takes more than a day.    
Special occasions sometimes occur in Mark Twain when famous people start visiting the school and cameras will be on. The school will always give out a letter and ask permission if the camera crew could take a picture. 

Mark Twain consist of one of the most buses in New York City intermediate school because students from all over New York city including those from Bronx join the school making it hard for others to walk home or walk to school, so tons of buses drive students to school or back home. 

Mark Twain is a famous school because of its programs and academic advantages over other schools, but the main reason for so many people choosing to join the school is because students entering it has a high rate of getting into a Specialized High School, which is the top public high schools of New York city.
Punishments in Mark Twain and like all schools have reasons for that punishment. When a student attacks or retaliates against a student, he or she may be suspended or possibly expelled from the school. Some important crimes include graffiti in restrooms, which leads to arrestment or severe punishment, for instance suspended. People of the Mark Twain sometimes face punishment because they weren't doing there homework correctly or barely pays attention during class. Mark Twain strictly forbids the act of chewing gum, devastating the restrooms, throwing paper, and playing with water bottles. Investigators are sometimes sent out to identify handprints and catch the culprit of a wrong doing. Lunch period punishments include silent lunch, no desserts, and eating last.  

Mark Twain is visualized as a three floor building with a roof on top. Subjects are organized through the floors. The first floor consists of language arts and 6L talent classes. The second floor consists of social studies classes and most of the foreign language classes. The locker rooms for gym also stand on this floor. Computer class lies with these subject classes also. The two talents on this floor is math and creative writing. The third floor groups math classes, science classes, technology class, science talent, dance talent, media talent, and one foreign language class, which is French.  
Enrichment is an extra class use to consume time and allow students to participate in different subjects most children will not do. ID classes are classes for students from 7th to 8th grade. This system of ID classes functions as a individual schedule for students. ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4 classes can be different to everyone in each homeroom and are replacements for science, math, English, and social studies class. This tolerates students from other homerooms to interact with each other.  
Mark Twain has a school website called http://is239.schoolwires.com, which provides the name of teachers and the events that are occurring those few days. Teachers are also posted on the website so homework can be seen for each class. Sometimes teachers might post useful websites for students to use or learn from.

<doc id="1660636" title="T?ebí?" nonfiltered="220" processed="219" dbindex="450220">



T ebí  (German: Trebitsch) is a city in Moravia of the Czech Republic with a population of approximately 40,000. The city is located on the Jihlava river. The Jewish Quarter and St Procopius' Basilica is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

 History and sights .
This includes the old Jewish Quarter and the largely Romanesque St Procopius' Basilica that incorporates some later gothic features, including a rare example of a ten-part or 'botanical' rose window. Such designs reflect the five or ten parts of the roseaceae family flowers and fruit, based on their five sepals and petals or the usual ten segments of their fruit. Botanical rose windows contrast with more complex Gothic windows that contain more segments (usually multiples of traditional gothic units of design - three trefoil, or four quatrefoil), or are based on ancient design inspiration from forerunners of the wheel of life which is now associated with eastern religions, or may alude to the Virgin Mary. 

The famous Basilica originated in the early 12th century as a Benedictine monastery. It was so well endowed that it led to the establishment of a local commercial centre; the city of Trebic. The monastery was rebuilt during the reign of King Wenceslas I (1230-53), and again at the end of the fifteenth century.  During the first half of the 16th century some of Trebic's historic monastic buildings were remodelled as a castle, and later renovated in baroque style. In the early eighteenth century changes were introduced to the basilica by Czech architect, Frantisek Maxmilian Kanka; windows were enlarged, buttresses added, a south-west tower was rebuilt, and a new west front with two towers was constructed in a gothicising baroque style.

The historic town of Trebic, which extends on both sides of the river Jihlava, was declared a Conservation Area in 1990. The Jewish Quarter and St. Procopius Basilica with the castle and gardens, are all included within the Trebic Conservation Area.

Ditz von Shaunburg was a Bavarian nobleman, sentenced to death by beheading in 1336 by King Ludwig for rebelling against him and disturbing the peace of the kingdom. When asked what his last request was, Ditz responded that he wanted his associates who were sentenced to die with him be spared if his headless body walked past them. So the king lined up his associates (8) next him. After the ax fell, the corpse supposedly walked 32 steps, passing all of them. The factual accuracy of this is questionable, however. Thousands were killed by beheading during the French Revolution, and yet this never happened.

<doc id="8117288" title="Decorative concrete" nonfiltered="222" processed="221" dbindex="450222">

Decorative concrete involves concrete structures being used in roles that are not strictly related to concretes functional elements.  Concrete has long been prized for its great strength, especially when combined with steel rebar.  Concrete can be used for, among other things, decorative walls, floors and countertops that are both structurally sound but also provide a decorative finish that resembles polished stone and has an extremely low cost for materials.    

 New Concrete .


Countertops.
Concrete's versatility lends ideally to creating rich countertops.  Countertops made of concrete can be formed in a fashion that would be impractical in size and scale if made out of rock like granite or marble.  Height, coloring and textures can be changed fairly easily.  Aesthetic or practical items can be embedded in the concrete such as integral brass rails as pot holders or personal items such as shells, fossils, or mementos of purely sentimental value.  

 Integral Colorants .
Color material is blended with the concrete mix to color the aggregate throughout. Many of the colorants are Iron oxides and can create colors including blacks, yellows, and reds.  Greens can be achieved using Chromium and ultramarine can be used to create variants of blue.  Some of the compounds used to create coloring are heavy metals (including chromium) and can be released during the grinding and polishing of the concrete.  These heavy metals can cause severe respiratory problems and environmental damage.  

 Stamping .
Patterns are impressed into wet concrete slabs or overlays to create textures or the appearance of brick or stone.

 New or Existing Concrete .

 Acid Staining .
Acid staining is not a dyeing process but a chemical process. A mixture of water, salts and acid is applied to the concrete surface and later neutralized by a basic solution, like baking soda and water. This chemical reaction with the existing minerals in the concrete creates new colors on the concrete surface. The thickness of this color change ranges from 1/16th to 1/32nd of an inch. Exterior concrete surfaces may not color as well as interior surfaces because the environment has leached or percolated out the mineral content. Acid stains are sometimes combined with dyes to create different colors.

Typical Steps for Acid Staining:
 Surfaces must be cleaned throughly with a mild detergent.
 A test area is treated first to determine the strength of acid stain required for the desired color. (A weaker solution is tested first and increased in strength until the intended color is obtained.);
 Acid solution applied to surface with acid-resistant paint brushes, mops, rollers or sprayers.
 Solution is allowed to react on the surface for a set amount of time.
 Reaction is stopped with a basic solution and rinsed away with water.
 Surface is dried and then sealed with a wax, polyurethane or epoxy sealer.

Chemicals commonly used:
 Hydrochloric acid;
 Iron chloride;
 Sodium bicarbonate;

 Concrete Dyes .
Solvent based concrete dyes are added to acid staining mixtures to increase the variety of colors.

 Epoxy .
Applied over acid stained and/or overlays to seal and protect. Some epoxies are also colored.

 Overlaying .
A veneer or new concrete is poured over existing concrete to hide pitted or cracked surfaces. Vertical overlays are applied to wall surfaces and stamped with patterns to simulate brick or stone.

 Polishing .
Concrete is polished with grinders and sanding pads of increasing grit (up to 3000) in multiple stages until it has a hard-glassy finish.
Polished Concrete is a practical, decorative & economical floor system for any facility. From showrooms to industrial plants, government buildings to retail facilities, dry-polished concrete is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing phenomena to ever hit the flooring industry. Contrary to other temporary surface chemical processes, Dry-Polished Concrete is a mechanical grinding & polishing process that utilizes industrial diamonds & impregnating hardeners and sealers to level, densify, polish & finally seal the floor from within the interior of the floor surface.

<doc id="6813018" title="Turtle (Entourage)" nonfiltered="223" processed="222" dbindex="450223">

Turtle  is a character on the dramedy television series Entourage. He is played by Jerry Ferrara.

Turtle, like Eric, is a childhood friend of Vince's from Queens. Turtle is Vincent's driver and takes care of issues around the house.  He brings street smarts and an urban flavor to the group and is a frequent user of marijuana. Despite his parasitic relationship with Vince, his loyalty and friendship temper his baser qualities, like working with Eric to protect Vince from a vindictive internet journalist.  In season two, Eric's car is stolen by two friends as a means of getting their rap demo tape into the hands of a music producer who has the exact same car.  Loving the music, Turtle gets a track into Queens Boulevard and agrees to manage the promising musician played by real life rapper Saigon.  Saigon received a great deal of interest from several record companies after Vince arranged for Saigon's music to be played by Big Boy on popular L.A. radio station, Power 106.  After Turtle obtained representation for Saigon from Ari, Turtle lost his client when Saigon informed him that a former manager had returned and muscled Turtle out of the picture.

Turtle's real name has not been revealed yet. The Turtle character was based on Mark Wahlberg's real-life assistant, 39-year-old Donnie "Donkey" Carroll.  Donkey carried Wahlberg's bags for more than 14 years while trying to launch a career as a rap musician under the name Murda One.  Donkey died suddenly on December 18, 2005 of an asthma attack.  Donkey and Wahlberg had a falling out earlier in 2005 because Carroll claimed Wahlberg never paid him for appropriating his life story for Entourage. He said all the other real-life characters had been taken care of but that he'd been cut out.

<doc id="1429577" title="Epithalamus" nonfiltered="224" processed="223" dbindex="450224">

The epithalamus is a dorsal posterior segment of the diencephalon (a segment in the middle of the brain also containing the hypothalamus and the thalamus) which includes the habenula, the stria medullaris and the pineal body. Its function is the connection between the limbic system to other parts of the brain.

Some functions of its components include the secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland, and the regulation of hunger and thirst by the habenula.

Details from Gray's anatomy.
The Epithalamus comprises the trigonum habenulæ, the pineal body, and the posterior commissure.

Trigonum habenulæ.
The trigonum habenulæ is a small depressed triangular area situated in front of the superior colliculus and on the lateral aspect of the posterior part of the tænia thalami. 

It contains a group of nerve cells termed the ganglion habenulæ. 

Fibers enter it from the stalk of the pineal body, and others, forming what is termed the habenular commissure, pass across the middle line to the corresponding ganglion of the opposite side. 

Most of its fibers are, however, directed downward and form a bundle, the fasciculus retroflexus of Meynert, which passes medial to the red nucleus, and, after decussating with the corresponding fasciculus of the opposite side, ends in the interpeduncular ganglion.

Pineal body.
The pineal body (corpus pineale; epiphysis) is a small, conical, reddish-gray body which lies in the depression between the superior colliculi. 

It is placed beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum, but is separated from this by the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle, the lower layer of which envelops it. 

It measures about 8 mm. in length, and its base, directed forward, is attached by a stalk or peduncle of white substance. 

The stalk of the pineal body divides anteriorly into two laminæ, a dorsal and a ventral, separated from one another by the pineal recess of the third ventricle. 

The ventral lamina is continuous with the posterior commissure; the dorsal lamina is continuous with the habenular commissure and divides into two strands the medullary striæ, which run forward, one on either side, along the junction of the medial and upper surfaces of the thalamus to blend in front with the columns of the fornix.

Posterior commissure.
The posterior commissure is a rounded band of white fibers crossing the middle line on the dorsal aspect of the upper end of the cerebral aqueduct. 

Its fibers acquire their medullary sheaths early, but their connections have not been definitely determined. 

Most of them have their origin in a nucleus, the nucleus of the posterior commissure (nucleus of Darkschewitsch), which lies in the central gray substance of the upper end of the cerebral aqueduct, in front of the nucleus of the oculomotor nerve. 

Some are probably derived from the posterior part of the thalamus and from the superior colliculus, while others are believed to be continued downward into the medial longitudinal fasciculus.

<doc id="5941993" title="Mala onda" nonfiltered="225" processed="224" dbindex="450225">

Mala onda is a highly acclaimed novel by Chilean novelist Alberto Fuguet. The novel brought Fuguet to the attention of Latin American and international critics, and is still perhaps the novel most associated with the author. It deals with a short period in the life of Matías Vicuña, a teenager who is fed up with what he perceives as the homogeneity and idiocy of his family and peers. The protagonist experiences a crisis throughout the course of the novel, somewhat paralleling that of Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of The Catcher in the Rye, a novel which Mala onda often references explicitly. In addition to the theme of the coming of age of a maladjusted youth, the novel relatedly deals heavily with North American consumer culture and the Chilean fetishization of it. The novel is furthermore set against the backdrop of growing opposition to Pinochet's dictatorship. The protagonist, of upper middle-class origins, must come to a political awareness that defies his upbringing.

<doc id="981899" title="Buyer decision processes" nonfiltered="228" processed="227" dbindex="450228">
Buyer decision processes are the decision making processes undertaken by consumers in regard to a potential market transaction before, during, and after the purchase of a product or service.

More generally, decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action from among multiple alternatives.  Common examples include shopping, deciding what to eat. Decision making is said to be a psychological construct. This means that although we can never "see" a decision, we can infer from observable behaviour that a decision has been made. Therefore we conclude that a psychological event that we call "decision making" has occurred. It is a construction that imputes commitment to action. That is, based on observable actions, we assume  that people have made a commitment to effect the action.

In general there are three ways of analysing consumer buying decisions. They are:
 Economic models - These models are largely quantitative and are based on the assumptions of rationality and near perfect knowledge. The consumer is seen to maximize their utility. See consumer theory. Game theory can also be used in some circumstances.
 Psychological models - These models concentrate on psychological and cognitive processes such as motivation and need reduction. They are qualitative rather than quantitative and build on sociological factors like cultural influences and family influences.
 Consumer behaviour models - These are practical models used by marketers. They typically blend both economic and psychological models.

Nobel laureate Herbert Simon sees economic decision making as a vain attempt to be rational. He claims (in 1947 and 1957) that if a complete analysis is to be done, a decision will be immensely complex. He also says that peoples' information processing ability is very limited. The assumption of a perfectly rational economic actor is unrealistic. Often we are influenced by emotional and non-rational considerations. When we try to be rational we are at best only partially successful.

Models of buyer decision making.
In an early study of the buyer decision process literature, Frank Nicosia (Nicosia, F. 1966; pp 9-21) identified three types of buyer decision making models. They are the univariate model (He called it the "simple scheme".) in which only one behavioural determinant was allowed in a stimulus-response type of relationship; the multi-variate model (He called it a "reduced form scheme".) in which numerous independent variables were assumed to determine buyer behaviour; and finally the system of equations model (He called it a "structural scheme" or "process scheme".) in which numerous functional relations (either univariate or multi-variate) interact in a complex system of equations. He concluded that only this third type of model is capable of expressing the complexity of buyer decision processes. In chapter 7, Nicosia builds a comprehensive model involving five modules. The encoding module includes determinants like "attributes of the brand", "environmental factors", "consumer's attributes", "attributes of the organization", and "attributes of the message". Other modules in the system include, consumer decoding, search and evaluation, decision, and consumption.

General model.
A general model of the buyer decision process consists of the following steps:
 Want recognition;
 Search of information on products that could satisfy the needs of the buyer;
 Alternative selection;
 Decision-making on buying the product;
 Post-purchase behavior.

There are a range of alternative models, but that of AIUAPR, which most directly links to the steps in the marketing/promotional process is often seen as the most generally useful;AWARENESS - before anything else can happen the potential customers must become aware that the product or service exists. Thus, the first task must be to gain the attention of the target audience. All the different models are, predictably, agreed on this first step. If the audience never hears the message they will not act on it, no matter how powerful it is. INTEREST - but it is not sufficient to grab their attention. The message must interest them and persuade them that the product or service is relevant to their needs. The content of the message(s) must therefore be meaningful and clearly relevant to that target audience's needs, and this is where marketing research can come into its own. UNDERSTANDING - once an interest is established, the prospective customer must be able to appreciate how well the offering may meet his or her needs, again as revealed by the marketing research. This may be no mean achievement where the copywriter has just fifty words, or ten seconds, to convey everything there is to say about it. ATTITUDES - but the message must go even further; to persuade the reader to adopt a sufficiently positive attitude towards the product or service that he or she will purchase it, albeit as a trial. There is no adequate way of describing how this may be achieved. It is simply down to the magic of the copywriters art; based on the strength of the product or service itself. PURCHASE - all the above stages might happen in a few minutes while the reader is considering the advertisement; in the comfort of his or her favourite armchair. The final buying decision, on the other hand, may take place some time later; perhaps weeks later, when the prospective buyer actually tries to find a shop which stocks the product. REPEAT PURCHASE - but in most cases this first purchase is best viewed as just a trial purchase. Only if the experience is a success for the customer will it be turned into repeat purchases. These repeats, not the single purchase which is the focus of most models, are where the vendors focus should be, for these are where the profits are generated. The earlier stages are merely a very necessary prerequisite for this!

This is a very simple model, and as such does apply quite generally. Its lessons are that you cannot obtain repeat purchasing without going through the stages of building awareness and then obtaining trial use; which has to be successful. It is a pattern which applies to all repeat purchase products and services; industrial goods just as much as baked beans. This simple theory is rarely taken any further - to look at the series of transactions which such repeat purchasing implies. The consumer's growing experience over a number of such transactions is often the determining factor in the later - and future - purchases. All the succeeding transactions are, thus, interdependent - and the overall decision-making process may accordingly be much more complex than most models allow for. 

Decision making style.
According to I. B. Myers, a person's decision making process depends to a significant degree on their cognitive style. A study was performed to explore how different cognitive styles affect the decisions of people. Subjects were classified into two different cognitive styles, type A and type B, and were to engage in a task that involved making decisions (Cheng 39). The analysis in Cheng s study shows that type A personalities, with a mean score 6,627, performed significantly better than people with type B personalities, with a mean score of 4,446 in making decisions for this task (56-57). This shows that a person s decision making process depends upon their cognitive style. The relationship between decision style and the behavior of decision makers identifies an individual s decision making style.

Determining Decision Making Style through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

Starting from the work of Carl Jung, Myers developed the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a personality test designed to identify a person s preferences using a set of four bi-polar dimensions. The MBTI is tested to be accurate in determining people s personality types. It exceeds 70% accuracy when determining a person s personality dimensions (Gardner 46-50). The eight preferences on these dimensions are: thinking and feeling; extraversion and introversion; judgment and perception; and sensing and intuition. In its basic form, the test consists of a series of forced-choice questions that represent behavioral preferences (e.g., At a party I like to:  tell jokes to others, or  listen to others) and preferred self-descriptive adjectives (e.g.,  daring or  cautious). The results are tabulated to indicate the preferences for each of the four scales, Extroversion-Introversion (EI), Sensing-Intuition (SN), Thinking-Feeling (TF), and Judgment-Perception (JP) (Pittenger 470). A person s personality type helps determine their decision making style.

A person s decision making style is based largely on how they score on the four dimensions of the MBTI.  For example, an experiment by Henderson determined how decision style influenced the likelihood of people adopting children with a perception of risk (381). Different types of people s personalities, received from the MBTI, were tested; SF s (Sensation-Feeling) were most likely to adopt with 70% who saw very little risk, and 58% of ST s (Sensation-Thinking) were least likely to adopt, who saw more of a risk. The amount of risk involved in adoption was influential in different personality decision making; 54% of SF s would adopt at a high risk for complications while only 37% of ST s would adopt (Henderson 382). People with different personalities and cognitive styles make different decisions which can be determined using the MBTI. 

People use all eight personality types of the MBTI, but only one from each of the four basic preferences is generally favored. Someone that scored near the extroversion, sensing, thinking, and judgment end of the dimensions would tend to have a logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision making style. The combination of these four preferences results in the psychological type (in this example E-S-T-J). Extroversion is the preference that relates to drawing energy from outside oneself in the external world of peers, activities, and things (Kennedy 39). Sensing is the preference for paying attention to information that is perceived directly through the five senses and focusing on what actually exists. Thinking relates to organizing and structuring information to decide in a logical and objective way. Judgment relates to living a planned and organized life (Kennedy 39). How a person scores on the four personality scales determines their decision making style.

Using the MBTI people can predetermine how others will make decisions by determining their personalities. Over three million people a year complete the MBTI and nearly 40% of major corporations use this for team building, hiring and management development (Gardner 45). The MBTI helps many people, including managers and marketers determine employees and buyers personalities and decision making styles to make the best outcome for their business.

Validation Testing of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

To test the reliability of the MBTI many test-retest procedures have been done. According to Marcia Carlyn, the MBTI has been proven to be accurate by having the same person retake the test after a period of time and end up with the same personality dimensions 70% of the time (465). In 1996 J.A. Wright studied 94 elementary school teachers who were retested six years after they had originally taken the MBTI, 61% of them remained in the same category in all four dimensions. In each category, 83% of E-I types, 89% of S-N types, 90% of T-F types, and 90% of J-P types had no change (Carlyn 467). 

A study of content validity in the MBTI was performed by Bradway in 1964; he tested 28 people who studied Jung s theory (Carlyn 487). The Jungian analysts classified themselves in each category as either an E-I, S-N, and T-F. Then they were given the MBTI and compared their self-typing and the actual MBTI typing; 100% of their own thought and the MBTI agreed on E-I classification, 68% agreed on S-N classification, 61% agreed on the T-F classification, and 43% agreed on all three dimensions (Carlyn 468).

Group Decision Making Process

Group composition creates better decision making skills with different personalities working together. In a study by Volkema, groups were composed on the basis of cognitive style, some groups had one type of dimension from the MBTI (S-J s) and other groups had multiple dimensions (a mix of N-T, N-F, S-J, S-P) (112).  In order to analyze their decision making styles each group was hypothetically placed in a life-threatening situation and had to rank a list of 15 items in order of importance. Each person ranked the items individually and then with their group. Comparing each score with the correct survival ranking score determined how people s decision making was affected in groups. The average group score was 7.6 points better than the average individual score. The average score for groups with multiple personalities was 10.8 points better and for groups with the same personality dimensions was 4.4 points better than individuals (Volkema 114-16). Working in groups with a variety of people composed of multiple personalities and cognitive styles, often produces a better outcome in decision making rather than individually.

Cognitive and personal biases in decision making.
It is generally agreed that biases can creep into our decision making processes, calling into question the correctness of a decision. Below is a list of some of the more common cognitive biases.
 Selective search for evidence - We tend to be willing to gather facts that support certain conclusions but disregard other facts that support different conclusions.
 Premature termination of search for evidence - We tend to accept the first alternative that looks like it might work.
 Conservatism and inertia - Unwillingness to change thought patterns that we have used in the past in the face of new circumstances.
 Experiential limitations - Unwillingness or inability to look beyond the scope of our past experiences; rejection of the unfamiliar.
 Selective perception - We actively screen-out information that we do not think is salient.
 Wishful thinking or optimism - We tend to want to see things in a positive light and this can distort our perception and thinking.
 Recency - We tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information.
 Repetition bias - A willingness to believe what we have been told most often and by the greatest number of different of sources.
 Anchoring - Decisions are unduly influenced by initial information that shapes our view of subsequent information.
 Group think - Peer pressure to conform to the opinions held by the group.
 Source credibility bias - We reject something if we have a bias against the person, organization, or group to which the person belongs: We are inclined to accept a statement by someone we like.
 Incremental decision making and escalating commitment - We look at a decision as a small step in a process and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with zero-based decision making.
 Inconsistency - The unwillingness to apply the same decision criteria in similar situations.
 Attribution asymmetry - We tend to attribute our success to our abilities and talents, but we attribute our failures to bad luck and external factors. We attribute other's success to good luck, and their failures to their mistakes.
 Role fulfilment - We conform to the decision making expectations that others have of someone in our position.
 Underestimating uncertainty and the illusion of control - We tend to underestimate future uncertainty because we tend to believe we have more control over events than we really do.
 Faulty generalizations - In order to simplify an extremely complex world, we tend to group things and people. These simplifying generalizations can bias decision making processes.
 Ascription of causality - We tend to ascribe causation even when the evidence only suggests correlation. Just because birds fly to the equatorial regions when the trees lose their leaves, does not mean that the birds migrate because the trees lose their leaves.

Yamato Delgado, known as Yamato Daiwa (      Daiwa Yamato) in Japan, is the main character in the Battle B-Daman series.

(Note: The name "Yamato Daiwa" is a pun. "Daiwa" is an alternate pronounciation of "Yamato" [  ], the ancient name of Japan.)

Yamato Delgado.


Yamato was raised by cats until the age of 5 which he often mentions and he still acts like a cat at times. In the Japanese versions, he speaks in the Osaka dialect, and mixes his Japanese with meows and purrs, as a result of his upbringing by cats. He uses the B-Daman Cobalt Blade which his mother found with him when he was living with the cats. Later on it is smashed in a B-Dabattle while battling one of the Super Five Field members which turned on him and tried to destroy Cobalt Blade. Afterwards With the help of his friends and Armada they build Yamato a new B-Daman from scratch called Cobalt Saber which was part of Armada's new series of B-Daman.

Yamato is quick to make decisions and sometimes this gets him into trouble. For example when his B-Daman Cobalt Saber was first made he rushed of with it before it was finished. There was one piece that was missing to his B-Daman. He found a piece of Cobalt Blade in his pocket and found out that it was the missing piece to his Cobalt Saber. He attached it to his B-Daman and it was complete. He then stated that a piece of Cobalt Blade would now always be with him.

Yamato's friend Terry McScotty ("Tsubame Tsubakura") was first seen on the very first episode when he helped out Yamato when some bullies were picking on him because he didn't have a B-Daman.

Yamato's friend Bull Borgnine is very strange. He has three egos: a calm sort of clueless side, a more confident mature side, and a reckless side which is present mostly when he is B-Dabattleing. Yamato saved Bull from falling off a mountain twice but Bull didn't remember much of it.

Yamato's friend Gray Michael Vincent was once a member of the Shadow Alliance because they had his sister Liena. They rescued her and she has been traveling with Yamato and his friends since. Gray was also seen on the first episode when he crashed Yamato's birthday cake and challenged him to a B-Dabattle which is when Cobalt Blade first found Yamato.

Fabrosaurus (FAB-ro-sawr-us) (IPA /fæb os '  s/) meaning "Fabre's lizard" in honor of Jean Henri Fabre (Greek sauros = lizard) was a herbivorous dinosaur of the Early Jurassic (208 - 196 mya). As the only fossil record is a partial jawbone with three teeth, Fabrosaurus is a nomen dubium and may in fact be Lesothosaurus.

Fabrosaurus was around 1 m (3 ft) long and 0.3 m (1 ft) high, weighing approximately 15 kg (38 lb). Little else can be inferred from the small fossil record. It was named after Jean Henri Fabre in 1964, by paleontologist Leonard Ginsburg. The type species, F. australis, is named for the location of the fossils in Lesotho, Southern Africa.

Kevin Constantine (b. December 27, 1958) has coached hockey teams in the NHL, IHL, and numerous major junior hockey leagues.  He is currently coach of the Everett Silvertips in the WHL.

Record as a coach.
Born in International Falls, Minnesota, Constantine made a name for himself as a head coach in the late 1980s and early 1990s by guiding the Rochester Mustangs of the NAHL and the Kansas City Blades of the IHL to winning records.  Having found success at lower levels, he was hired as head coach of the San Jose Sharks for the 1993-1994 season: under his guidance, the team set an NHL record for largest improvement by finishing 58 points higher in the standings than it had the previous season.  Between 1993 and 2002, Constantine would coach the Sharks, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New Jersey Devils,  earning a record of 159-153-66.  He is the only coach in NHL history to take two eighth-seeded teams to first-round Stanley Cup playoff upsets (San Jose over the Detroit Red Wings in 1994 and Pittsburgh over New Jersey in 1999).

In 2001, he founded the Pittsburgh Forge, a new entry in the NAHL.  In two seasons as the team's general manager and co-coach, Constantine amassed a record of 80-24-8 -- the Forge won the NAHL regular season championship in 2002.  After the 2002-2003 season, Constantine left Pittsburgh to be hired by the WHL expansion team, the Everett Silvertips.  In their first year, the Silvertips broke the record for best season ever by a first-year team in the major junior hockey leagues (the WHL, OHL and QMJHL), winning the U.S. Division Championship -- they continued to set records, winning three straight playoff rounds to claim the Western Conference Championship and advance to the WHL Final against the Medicine Hat Tigers, where they lost 4-0.

Awards.
Constantine has been the recipient of USA Hockey's Distinguished Achievement Award: USA Hockey is the governing body for amateur ice hockey in the United States, and the award recognizes a U.S. citizen who has made a major contribution to hockey in the United States. 
 
He won the 1991-1992 Commissioner's Trophy.

Constantine also was awarded the Coach of the Year award by the WHL in 2004.

Captain Fergus Bowes-Lyon (April 18, 1889 - September 27, 1915) was a brother of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Just a fortnight after the start of World War I, he married Lady Christian Norah Dawson-Damer, daughter of the 5th Earl of Portarlington. Ten months later, she bore him a daughter, Rosemary Lusia, on 18 July 1915.

In the First World War he served with the 8th Battalion, Black Watch and was killed in the opening stages of the Battle of Loos. Leading an attack on the German lines, his leg was blown off by a barrage of German artillery and he fell back into his sergeant's arms. Bullets struck him in the chest and shoulder and he died on the field. He is commemorated on the Loos Memorial.

His mother, Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, was severely affected by the loss of her son, and after his death became an invalid withdrawn from public life until the marriage of her daughter Elizabeth to the future king in 1923.

Fergus's widow married secondly Captain William Frederick Martin and died on 29 March 1959.

The Manchukuo yuan ( ) was a unit of currency created by Japanese economists and military thinkers in June 1932. It was part of the economic and conquest plans based on Manchukuo.

The monetary unit was one basic pure silver patron of 23.91 grammes, equivalent to 30 cents (in U.S. dollars) or 1/3 (British shillings and pence) . It replaced the Chinese tael of Haikwan, the local monetary system in common and regular use in Manchuria before the Mukden incident.

Initially it was minted by the Bank of Japan (Japanese central bank), but later was issued in Hsinking (now Changchun) from the Bank of Manchukuo (Manchoukuoan central bank). It became the legal tender, from 1932 to until August 1945.

It was pegged to the Japanese yen at par. It was subdivided into 10 chiao ( ), 100 fen ( ) or 1000 li ( ). Coins were issued in denominations of 5 li up to 10 fen, with banknotes of 5 fen up to 1000 yuan.

In 1944 and 1945, Manchukuo issued coins (1 and 5 fen) made of what the "Standard Catalog of World Coins" describes as "red or brown fiber". These are a rare example of non-metallic coins.

Dead Letter is also colloquially applied to any set of instructions, especially a law, that has lost its authority without being formally abollished or repealed.

Dead Letter Mail (also known as a Dead Letter) is mail that cannot be delivered to the addressee or returned to the sender.  This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and return address, or the inability to forward the mail when both correpondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail. 
The term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. Being internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the Dead letter office or Undeliverable Mail Office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.

Classification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to open first-class correspondence, ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination.  Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Surprisingly, some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by Marc Chagall which turned up in a United States Postal Service sorting center in Topeka, Kansas. 

Partly due to the development of computerized mail merge systems, the amount of undeliverable mail is increasing at a fairly high rate as more correspondence is sent out with incomplete or improper addresses.

It is anticipated that with increased collection and study of the postal markings originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic will grow.  Many countries, including Canada and the United States, have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.

People interested in postal services throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender.  Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.

Mary Jackson is a fictional character from the alternate Earths in the Stephen King and Richard Bachman Novels Desperation and The Regulators, respectively.

On both worlds, she is the wife of Peter Jackson.

 Death .
As is the case with the majority of the characters of the two novels, Mary Jackson  survives the events of one book but dies in the other.

She narrowly escapes becoming the next vessel of Tak on the Earth in which the events of "Desperation" takes place; however, she falls victim to the Regulators in the other book when she is killed by a shotgun blast to the face.

Lancashire was established as a county in 1182, making it one of the youngest of the historic counties of England, although there is evidence that the boundaries of the county were settled as early as 1100.  In the Domesday Book, its lands had been treated as part of Cheshire (the area south of the River Ribble) and of Yorkshire.  It bordered Cumberland, Westmorland, Yorkshire, and Cheshire.

Lancashire was established soon after the Norman conquest when William the Conqueror gave the land between the Ribble and the Mersey, together with Amounderness, to Roger de Pitou.  In the early 1090s Lonsdale, Cartmel and Furness were added to Roger's estates to facilitate the defence of the area south of Morecambe Bay from Scottish raiding parties, which travelled round the Cumberland coast and across the bay at low water, rather than through the mountainous regions of the Lake District.

The county is traditionally divided into the six hundreds of Amounderness, Blackburn, Leyland, Lonsdale, Salford and West Derby.  Lonsdale was further partitioned into Lonsdale North, which was the detached part north of Morecambe Bay (also known as Furness), and Lonsdale South.

The modern administrative area is now rather smaller than that of the historic county due to a local government reform.

On April 1, 1974 the Furness exclave was given to the new county of Cumbria, the south east being given to Greater Manchester, and the south-west becoming Merseyside.

Warrington and surrounding districts including the villages of Winwick and Croft and Risley and Culcheth were annexed to Cheshire.  A part of the West Riding of Yorkshire near Clitheroe, was transferred to Lancashire also.

In 1998 Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen became independent of the county as unitary authorities, but remained in Lancashire for ceremonial purposes, as well as for fire and rescue and policing.

Monica Maughan is an Australian actor with notable and well-known roles in film, theatre and television.

She launched her professional career at the Union Repertory Theatre Company (URTC) at Melbourne University playing Capulat in Jean Anouilh's romantic comedy Ring Round the Moon in 1957. Her first leading role came that same year in Beauty and the Beast. URTC, Australia's first professional theatre company, became the Melbourne Theatre Company (MTC) in 1968.  Monica Maughan has appeared in more plays for that flagship company than any other actor.

She has worked for every major theatre company in Australia including Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and Alan Bennett's Habeas Corpus for the Queensland Theatre Company in 1978 and the role of Aggie in A Hard God produced by the State Theatre Company of South Australia in 1981. Perhaps Maughan's best-known stage role was as Miss Prism in the MTC's "The Importance of Being Earnest". The production, co-starring Geoffrey Rush, was so popular that it toured Australia between 1988 and 1992, and was televised by the ABC. In 2003 she starred in Inheritance by Hannie Rayson. Maughan has also directed plays for the MTC.

Early television roles in Crawford's dramas led to ongoing television parts that made Maughan a recognisable face around Australia, including prim secretary Jean Ford in the first year of The Box (1974-75) and downtrodden prisoner Pat O'Connell for five months in women's-prison drama Prisoner in 1979.

Film roles include Strange Bedfellows (2004), Crackerjack (2002) and Road to Nhill (1997), plus a number of films by Dutch-Australian director Paul Cox.

Monica Maughan recently extended her repertoire to include non-dancing roles with the Australian Ballet, including Effie's mother in La Sylphide and Doreen's mother in The Sentimental Bloke.

<doc id="2099350" title="Shikakai" nonfiltered="248" processed="247" dbindex="450249">

Shikakai is a popular traditional powder shampoo used in India. It is taken from the crushed pods of Acacia Concinna, a small shrub found mainly in the South Asia. Mixed with water it is a popular remedy for dandruff and cleansing of hair.

Acacia Concinna.
Acacia Concinna is a small shrub-like tree which grows in the warm, dry plains of central India. For centuries the people who have had access to this tree have used its pod-like fruit to clean their hair. They collect, dry and grind this pod into a powder which is considered a superior cleanser for lustrous long hair and has been reported as "promoting hair growth and preventing dandruff". Because of these benefits, this powder was named "shikakai" which literally translates as "fruit for the hair".

Today this fruit is grown commercially in large quantities in India and the Far East. As a result, shikakai powder is readily available and continues to be commonly used as a preferred shampoo.Many popular brands are sold throughout India.

Usage.
While it does not have the normal amount of foam that a regular shampoo would have it helps in strengthening the hair from its roots.Typically, shikakai is mixed with water to make a paste which is worked through the hair. It lathers moderately and cleans hair beautifully. It has a natural low pH, is extremely mild, and doesn't strip hair of natural oils. Usually no rinse or conditioner is used since shikakai also acts as a detangler. This ancient product is probably the world's original pH balanced shampoo.

Barnsley is a large town in South Yorkshire, England, lying on the River Dearne, approximately twenty kilometres north of Sheffield. It is between junctions 36 and 37 of the M1 motorway and has a railway station served by the Hallam and Penistone Lines. It is the main town in the metropolitan borough of Barnsley. It has three MPs: Eric Illsley for Barnsley Central, Michael Clapham for Barnsley West and Penistone and Jeff Ennis for Barnsley East and Mexborough. They are all members of the Labour Party. The town itself has a population of just over 72,000 and the borough of around 223,500.

History.

The first historical reference to Barnsley occurs in 1086 in the Domesday Book, in which it is called 'Berneslai' with a total population of around 200. The exact origins of the name Barnsley is still subject to debate, but Barnsley Council claims that its origins lie in the Saxon word Berne, for barn or storehouse, and Lay, for field. Also there is rumour about the founder's being of Danish-Viking origin, and that the founders bloodline is now in Canada with the last name Barnes. In 1249, a Royal Charter was granted to Barnsley permitting it to hold a weekly market and annual fair.
Left undisturbed since the 17th century, Barnsley developed into a stop-off point on the route between Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield and London. The traffic generated as a result of this location fuelled trade with hostelries and related services also prospering. A principal centre for linen weaving during the 18th and 19th century, Barnsley grew into an important manufacturing town. Barnsley also has a long tradition of glass-making, but is most famous for its coalfields.
George Orwell briefly mentions the town in The Road to Wigan Pier. Orwell spent a number of days in the town living in the houses of the working-class miners while researching for the book. He wrote very critically of the council's expenditure on the construction of Barnsley Town Hall and claimed that the money should have been spent on improving the housing and living conditions of the local miners.

DBC - Danny brown crew,this crew was started in early 2007 to represent the great legend that is danny brown. there are currently around 30 members of the DBC of whos aim is to worship the holy lord of Danny Brown

Industry.
The town is famous for coal mining, although most of the pits were actually in the surrounding villages, rather than in the town itself. The proportion employed in mining varied hugely, even before recent times. The "Barnsley Main" colliery was in the town, but was fairly small; it closed in 1991. All of the mines in the borough are now closed; Goldthorpe was the last to close in 1994. Wire-, linen- and glass-making were also major industries, but only glass-making remains, with two large companies still operating. The coat of arms for the town includes a coal miner and a glass-blower. It is now moving towards a service economy.

The Western half of the Borough stretches from the M1 to the edge of the Peak District and is essentially rural in character. This Western part includes the Market Town of Penistone and some notable and remarkable places of interest, these include:
Wentworth Castle and Gardens (Grade 1 listed gardens)
Cannon Hall Park and Museum
Cawthorne Jubilee Museum
Wortley Hall and Gardens
Wortley Top Forge (16th Century Forge)

In 2002, Barnsley Council and partners launched a major consultation exercise called "Rethinking Barnsley". This led to a regeneration programme centred on Barnsley Town Centre called "Remaking Barnsley" . Developments include a new transport interchange, a new cultural centre in the old Civic Hall, a Digital Media Centre, and new offices and apartments throughout the Town Centre. At the same time, housebuilding has taken off and major new housing areas have been developed. Business Parks on the M1 at Junctions 37 and 36, and in the Dearne Valley, have also expanded the job opportunities locally. Unemployment is now below the national average but a large number of local people are on incapacity benefit. The economic development of Barnsley is led by the Barnsley Development Agency . 

Barnsley's Central Markets and main shopping centre (the Metropolitan Centre) are due to be redeveloped over the next few years, aimed to be complete by 2011.  Meanwhile there are proposals to redevelop part of the Town Hall into a museum and community heritage facility.  This project is called Experience Barnsley

Transport .

Barnsley Interchange is currently being rebuilt and is due for completion in the Spring of 2007. Barnsley has frequent bus links to nearby towns and cities run by Stagecoach Yorkshire and a number of small independent bus companies. The nearest airport is Robin Hood Airport just outside Doncaster, some 15 miles, which can easily be reached from Barnsley by the X19 service. The town also has a number of coach links to London and other major cities run by National Express. Barnsley railway station has two platforms and serves trains run by Northern Rail to Sheffield (2 Slow & 1 Fast Per Hour), Leeds (1 Slow and 1 Fast per hour) which includes Wakefield and Huddersfield (1 Slow per hour). There is also 1 service per day to London operated by Midland Mainline. One service each hour to Sheffield and Leeds is classified as a Fast service. This means it does not stop in outlying stations, it stops only at the larger stations on route. Northern has recently made investment in the service and has introduced newer Class 158 trains which offer passengers better comfort for the journey.

Stagecoach Yorkshire recently purchased the company Yorkshire Traction. Since the purchased the bus company in the town has been in the press in the town recently. It cancelled a number of vital services around the town and surrounding towns, and has left people stranded on a number of occasions. Although it now promises to make investments in new buses, it has not said whether it will re-introduce some of the routes.

Education.
Barnsley had long suffered from poor educational standards compared to the rest of the United Kingdom, but recent improvements in examination results have brought levels in line with the national average. Barnsley College is one the largest further and higher education establishments in Europe and is situated on a number of sites throughout the town centre, chiefly Old Mill Lane Site, Eastgate House, The Sci Tech Centre, Honeywell Site and the Construction centre. The college achieved a place in the top 10 worst colleges from its recent A Level results. The University of Huddersfield has recently opened a campus in the town on Church Street besides Barnsley Town Hall. This is known as the University Centre Barnsley.

Culture.
Barnsley is home to a proud tradition of brass bands, originally created as social clubs for the mining communities. Grimethorpe Colliery Band, located in a village 5 miles to the east of Barnsley, is perhaps the best brass band in Britain. It rose to fame in the film Brassed Off and is now the 'artist in residence' at the Royal College of Music, London. The band has performed in Hyde Park during the Last Night of the Proms.

The 'Bard of Barnsley' Ian McMillan writes in local dialect, was recently nominated for a chair of poetry at Oxford University, and often appears on Radio 4.

Ken Loach's film Kes was set and filmed in Barnsley, using local actors such as Freddie Fletcher.

There is a live rock music scene, which reached its height in the Britpop years, around 1997, due to its proximity to Sheffield and Manchester. Barnsley rock band Saxon were famous in the 1980s.  Two of the Arctic Monkeys studied music at Barnsley College.

Barnsley Council operates three museums, Cannon Hall, the Cooper Gallery and Worsbrough Mill.  There are plans for a fourth museum located within the town hall.  The project to create this is known as Experience Barnsley.  Other museums in Barnsley include the volunteer-run Darfield Museum and the Cawthorne Victoria Jubilee Museum.  Other heritage sites include Wortley Top Forge, Wortley Hall, Wentworth Castle and Monk Bretton Priory.

The Lamproom Theatre has three theatrical companies, and gives performances ranging from West End musicals to Shakespeare. Its Youth Company presents up to three productions a year and recently performed a critically acclaimed production of 'Les Miserables: School Edition' in November 2005 which was greeted by standing ovations on each performance.  The once celebrated Victorian theatre the 'Civic' has lapsed from its previous role as the cultural centre of the town and is now being developed into gallery space.

Barnsley has two twin towns:





Sport.
Barnsley F.C. football team play in the Championship of the English league. They play at the Oakwell Stadium just outside of the town centre. The club has had a mixed recent history. In the late 1990s they had a brief spell in the Premier League, but were relegated after just one season. Subsequent seasons saw them relegated to the third tier of English football. After 4 seasons, Barnsley finally regained their place in the Championship after beating Swansea City 4-3 on penalties in the play off final in Cardiff.

Politics.
The municipal council elect the mayor every year. In the day of the election, a parade takes place in front of the Town Hall. The parade is in honour of the new mayor.

<doc id="7636465" title="DeSisto School" nonfiltered="251" processed="250" dbindex="450252">
The DeSisto School may refer to either the DeSisto at Stockbridge School, or the DeSisto at Howey School,  founded by Michael DeSisto.


History.
Beginnings.
DeSisto at Stockbridge School was founded in 1978. It was conceived of as a therapeutic boarding school for teens who had problems in traditional school settings. It was created on the campus of the old Stockbridge School in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts, near Tanglewood and the Stockbridge Bowl. 

In 1980 DeSisto opened a second campus in Howey-in-the-Hills Florida named the DeSisto at Howey School. DeSisto originally envisioned a string of schools nationally and internationally based on the principles of Gestalt Psychology, and his own therapeutic model. The DeSisto School would develop a reputation as the place that celebrities, the rich, and political elites could send their children who had difficulty living at home, and functioning in traditional secondary school environments.

Controversies.
Quite early on, it would have problems from the state Department of Education which withdrew its accreditation after questions arose about the school's treatment of "special needs" students. The school sued in 1983, and won back its accreditation.

In 1986, the DeSisto School received national attention with the case of Heather Burdick, from Old Bridge, New Jersey, who was sent to the Stockbridge campus, and ran away from the school after only a few weeks. A group of parents from Burdick's hometown sought to sue The DeSisto School for illegally detaining Heather, but the action failed. The DeSisto School subsequently successfully counter-sued, and after $550,000 in legal expenses was awarded $41,000 for damages. 

The DeSisto at Howey School was not without its problems either. The DeSisto School sued Howey-in-the-Hills over zoning issues related to the incipient DeSisto College. The town of Howey-in-the-Hills was awarded $203,279.27 in attorney fees and $17,194.12 in costs. The case of DeSisto College, Inc. v. Town of Howey-in-the-Hills, 718 F.Supp. 906 (M.D.Fla. 1989), is often cited and used as a case study where the plaintiff's claim is frivolous because it has no basis in law, the plaintiff rejects any reasonable offer to settle, the trial court dismisses the case without trial, and the plaintiff does not offer any novel legal theories. On November 15, 1988 The Boston Globe reported that Michael DeSisto and The DeSisto School had been sued 23 times for breach of contract and fraud.

Author Roger Kahn, in the last chapter of his book Into My Own (2006), describes the negative experiences he had with DeSisto and the school's family therapy workshops he attended in 1979 with his son, who committed suicide in 1987.

Demise.

The DeSisto at Howey School closed in 1988, due to declining enrollment, and legal problems with the local government.
Following a long legal fight with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over licensing, allegations of child abuse, a Commonwealth imposed enrollment freeze, and accusations of failing to create a safe environment for its students, the DeSisto at Stockbridge School chose to voluntarily close in June 2004. 

The DeSisto at Stockbridge School was renamed The Cold Spring Academy, and opened a campus in Sarasota, Florida. The Cold Spring Academy permanently closed in 2005.

Michael Mangini (born April 18, 1963 in Newton, Massachusetts, USA) is a celebrated drummer who has played for Annihilator, Extreme, Steve Vai, Tribe Of Judah, and more recently, James LaBrie.  

 Biography .

Mangini began playing the drums at five and by practicing six to ten hours a day, he was already mimicking Buddy Rich performances by the time he was nine.  By high school, he was a noted young musician; performing in school bands while participating in the prestigious All-County, All-State, and all Eastern United States ensembles.

After graduating from high school in 1981 and with the encouragement of his parents, Mangini put aside his music studies to pursue a Computer Science major at the nearby Bentley College.  Later on, he would find himself programming software for the Patriot Missile program while working on a program that studied the links between the human brain and body.  These experiences would be integral in the development of his Rhythm Knowledge learning systems. 

In 1987, Mangini scored one of his first 'high-profile' gigs - playing drums for the Rick Berlin Band in Boston, where he worked with bassist Phillip Bynoe (who would later go on to work with Mike in sessions for Journey's Steve Perry and more notably during Mike's time in the Steve Vai band).  He also taught drums privately in Boston during this time.

In 1991, Mangini began working thrash metal band Annihilator; performing drums on several tracks for the studio album, Set the World on Fire.  He went on to tour with the band in support of this album up until 1994, when he was asked to play with the band Extreme.  Mike Mangini had been friends with noted Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt since the 1980s.  His time in Extreme included recording several tracks for their 1995 effort, Waiting For The Punchline, along with subsequent touring.  During this time, he also made an appearance with the band on The Late Show with David Letterman. 

After Extreme dissolved in 1996, Mike was informed through Jeff Campitelli (drummer for Joe Satriani) that guitarist Steve Vai was auditioning drummers for his live band.  Mike successfully auditioned for Steve Vai's band and relocated to Los Angeles.

From late 1996 to early 2000, Mangini was the highly regarded drummer of Vai's live ensemble, which also included bassist Phillip Bynoe, guitar wizard Mike Keneally and (in 2000) guitarist Dave Weiner.  Mike also cut several drum tracks for Steve's Fire Garden and Ultrazone albums.   

Following the initial suspension of the South American leg of the Ultrazone Tour in 2000, Mangini relocated back home to Boston and began teaching at the Berklee College of Music as an associate professor.  He began working with former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone and bassist Pat Badger in the short-lived band, Tribe of Judah.  He also continued to work with Dale Bozzio (formerly of the new wave band, Missing Persons), and cut several more records.  Among them were a Rush tribute record (entitled "Subdivisions") and a second full-length album with Annihilator.  He also recorded tracks for artists Sal DiFusco, Bill Lonero and Chris Emerson.        

In 2005, he accepted a full-time teaching position at the Berklee College of Music and is today a prominent faculty member in the school's percussion department.

 Notes .

Mangini is notorious for his technical prowess and currently holds three out of four World's Fastest Drummer titles.  These include the Fastest Matched grip at 1,247 strokes in 60 seconds, Fastest Hands, which he earned by executing 1,203 single-stroke notes in 60 seconds, and Fastest Traditional Grip which he earned by executing 1,126 strokes in 60 seconds.

Mangini has written two books about his drumming techniques. These books, titled Rhythm Knowledge, are a practice method for deconstructing and simplifying complex polyrhythms and time signatures.

Mike plays Pearl drums, Zildjian cymbals and Remo drumheads.

Grass pinks (genus Calopogon) are a group of terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae). The generic name is from Greek and means "beautiful beard", referring to the cluster of hairs adorning the labellum. The genus is mainly confined to the United States, with 5 species found in the southeastern U.S., but only one north into Wisconsin and parts of Ontario.

The genera Cathea Salisb. and Helleborine Kuntze have been brought into synonymy with Calopogon.

A bread clip is a device used to hold plastic bags (such as the ones presliced bread is commonly packaged in) closed. They are also commonly called bread tags or bread-bag clips. By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its open end, the clip may preserve its contents longer. Sometimes the colour of the tag indicates the day on which it was baked.

There are two different types of bread clips - a more common one-piece plastic clip, and a more complex mechanical clip. One particular design of bread clip is the subject of a patent in the USA.

Simple bread clips.


Most designs of bread clip consist of a single plastic part through which the neck of a plastic bag can be threaded. Because these bread clips are cheap, ubiquitous, and come in a variety of shapes and colors, some people collect them.

Because this type of bread clip is small and comes attached to food packages, it is sometimes swallowed accidentally by the elderly, which can cause perforation or blockage of the gastrointestinal tract.

In Canada, milk is often sold by the bag; the most common format is three 1.3-liter sealed bags packaged in a surrounding bag. This larger bag is closed by a clip identical to a bread clip, and imprinted with the milk's expected expiry date.

One activity involving bread clips is flicking them. This is done by breaking the bread clip along the line of symmetry by repeated folding, placing the hook-like projection of the clip under the fingernail of the index finger while keeping the clip horizontal (under the presumption that the nail is vertical), pressing the clip into the fingertip to make it stay, placing the thumb on top of the finger, and flicking.

Mechanical bread clips.


A more complex bread clip design involves two articulated plastic parts mounted on a pivot with a spring between them to provide tension.

Alternatives to bread clips.
There are several alternatives to bread clips, including:
 Twist ties;
 Sealing the end of the bag by heat-crimping.
 A small piece of plastic heat-crimped around the end of the bag.
 A strip of Adhesive tape.
 Tying off the bag.

History.
The bread clip was invented by Floyd Paxton and manufactured by the Kwik Lok Corporation based in Yakima, Washington with manufacturing plants in Yakima and New Haven, Indiana.

Consumers required packages that can be easily opened and re-closed with ease and packagers wanted a better bag closure method. The bread clip was developed in the early 1950s because there was a growing need to close plastic bags on the packaging line very efficiently. Manufactures using more and more automation in the manufacture and packaging of food needed methods to allow them to raise production volumes and reduce costs. At the same time a hurried (or lazy) population of consumers wanted a fast and easy way to open and effectively seal food bags (originally bread hence the name.) The simple bread clip allowed for that. In addition re-closability became a selling point as smaller families and higher costs slowed consumption, leading to a potential for higher rates of spoilage.

<doc id="663585" title="Green Grow the Rushes, O" nonfiltered="258" processed="257" dbindex="450259">
Green Grow the Rushes, O (aka The Twelve Prophet or The Carol of the Twelve Numbers or The Teaching Song ), is a folk song popular in England, Scotland, and Wales. The song is extremely old, first recorded in Hebrew in the 16th century and probably much older than that; at the present, it is sometimes sung as a Christmas carol. The song is not to be confused with Robert Burns' Green Grow the Rashes, O, with which it shares only the title. It is cumulative in structure, with each verse built up from the previous verse by appending a new stanza. The first verse is:

I'll sing you one, O;
Green grow the rushes, O;
What is your one, O?;
One is one and all alone;
And evermore shall be (it) so.;

The twelfth is:

I'll sing you twelve, O;
Green grow the rushes, O;
What are your twelve, O?;
Twelve for the twelve Apostles,;
Eleven for the eleven who went to heaven,;
Ten for the ten commandments,;
Nine for the nine bright shiners,;
Eight for the April rainers, (or April showerers, or occasionally Eight for the eight bold rangers,);
Seven for the seven stars in the sky,;
Six for the six proud walkers,;
Five for the symbols at your door,;
Four for the Gospel makers,;
Three, three, the rivals,;
Two, two, lily-white boys,;
Clothèd all in green, O;
One is one and all alone (sometimes One is one and one alone or One is one and stands alone);
And evermore shall be (it) so.;

The lyrics of the song are in many places extremely obscure, and present an unusual mixture of Christian catechesis, astronomical mnemonics, and what may very well be pagan cosmology. The song's origins are uncertain, but the first recorded instance of it is in Hebrew; it may have originated in the intricacies of medieval Jewish thought, although the Kabbalistic mystics were seldom interested in composing songs. A parallel may also be drawn with the Jewish Passover song "echad mi yodeia" (Who knows 1?), where e. g. 5 represents the books of the Pentateuch, 2 represents the luchot habrit (the stone tablets on which the 10 commandments are said to have been written), and one represents "our Lord, our Lord, our Lord who is in the heavens and the earth".  

"Green grow the rushes, O" sounds sufficiently out of place that one is inclined to ascribe it to the same origin as "Fine flowers in the valley" in one version of the ballad The Cruel Mother, namely, an attempt to turn a misremembered line of Gaelic into something that it sounds like in English. However, the song did not originate in the British Isles; thus, the line must have been included for a conscious reason, or been the product of an earlier disruption.

 Twelve is almost certainly the twelve apostles of Jesus, although the number has other meanings; it may originally have referred to the months of the year, for example.
 The eleven are the eleven Apostles who remained faithful (minus Judas Iscariot), or possibly St. Ursula and her companions.
 Ten are, fairly obviously, the ten commandments given to Moses.
 The nine may be an astronomical reference, although counting the sun, moon and planets known before 1781 yields at most 8, not 9. It could potentially refer to the nine orders (or 'choirs') of angels.
 The April rainers refer to the Hyades star cluster, called the "rainy Hyades" in classical times, and rising with the sun in April; the Greeks thought of them as inaugurating the April rains. "Eight bold rangers" is a very recent corruption, most likely the unfortunate consequence of singers with more knowledge of Tolkien than Greece.
 The seven are probably the Seven Sisters, the Pleiades star cluster, or perhaps Ursa Major, the Big Dipper. They may also be the planets or other stars.  Alternatively, the seven stars are those referred to in Revelation chapter 1.  They are first cited in verse 16 as being held in the right hand of Christ and then explained as referring to seven angels of the seven early Christian churches.
 The six seems to be a historical reference, but remains obscure. It is possible that they were members of a Saxon warband who beat the bounds of their fortified camp in a traditional way between A.D. 450 and A.D. 1066. Perhaps it is a Biblical reference to Ezekiel 9:2 - six men with swords come in a vision of the prophet to slaughter the people, whose leaders (8:16) have committed such sins as turning East to worship the Sun, and "have filled the land with violence." It may also be a corruption of "waters," but what "the six bold waters" might refer to remains unanswered.
 "Five for the symbols at your door" probably refers to the practice of putting a pentagram at the door of a house to ward off witches and evil spirits; this was relatively common in the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, and is alluded to in no shortage of literary works from or set in those eras. It can also refer to the five books of Moses - the pentateuch. An alternative interpretation is given by John Timpson in his book Timpson's England, where he states that it refers to five symbols displayed above the doorways of houses that would shelter Catholic priests. He gives an example a house where these can still be seen.
 Four refers to the four Evangelists, Mathew, Mark, Luke and John.
 Some have suggested that "the three" are the Trinity, but this leaves "the rivals" unexplained. The I Ching contains the interesting proverb that "when three meet together, doubts arise among them," although it probably has no bearing on the interpretation of this song. The three could also refer to the 3 major religious traditions of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. "The three" could also refer to the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, alluding to the previous line. These three give similar though slightly different accounts of the life of Christ. Or the "three rivals" could be Peter, James and John who are often mentioned together in the Gospels and at one time: "A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest." (Luke 22:24). ;
Some suggest the three are three similar and adjacent mountains in Wales.
 The two remain obscure. Jesus and John the Baptist have been suggested. Possibly they are the holly and the ivy (although the holly berry is red, the ivy berry is black), both have white wood and are evergreen. Pagan tradition also has the holly and the ivy as male and female, so they are not both 'boys'. Possibly they are holly and mistletoe (white berries with green branches) which would align more closely with the tradition of the  defeat at yule of the holly king by the oak king (mistletoe 'traditionally' grows on oak trees, although it will grow on other types of tree). Robert Graves suggested that they are the Holly King and Oak King. There is some suggestion that the two may be the Old and New Testaments, perhaps referring to some mediaeval tradition, although "clad all in green" strongly suggests that the two boys were in some way connected with the growth of plants.
 Another explanation is that the statues of St John and Our Lady which in Christian Churches flank the Crucifix on the Altar reredos or the Rood screen were, during Holy Week, bound round with rushes to cover them.  (During Holy Week, from Palm Sunday until Easter Day all statues, crosses, crucifixes etc are traditionally covered up from view or removed and no flowers are in the Church). The two figures were portrayed in similar garments, hence the 'lily-white boys' and wrapped in rushes they were 'dressed up all in green'.
 One would suppose that the "One" of the last line would be God, but God in the Middle Ages was more commonly thought of as the Trinity, and "one is one and one alone," if applied to God, sounds more like Jewish or Muslim theology than Christian in its strong insistence on the Divine unity.

Aurel C. Popovici (16 October 1863 Lugoj, Transylvania -  9 February 1917 Geneva, Switzerland) was an Austria-Hungary ethnic Romanian lawyer and politician. With other Romanian intellectuals of the National Romanian Party, he signed the Transylvanian Memorandum, a document pleading for equal rights with Hungarians in Transylvania, and demanding an end to persecutions and Magyarization attempts. 

In 1906 he proposed the federalization of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy (into the so-called United States of Greater Austria).

<doc id="2626869" title="Theodotus of Aetolia" nonfiltered="264" processed="263" dbindex="450265">
Theodotus (in Greek   o o o ) was an Aetolian, who at the accession of Antiochus III the Great (223 187 BC) held the command of the important province of Coele-Syria for Ptolemy Philopator (221 204 BC), king of Egypt. He was an able general, and repulsed with ease the first attack made by the king of Syria upon his government, but instead of being rewarded by Ptolemy for his services, he was recalled to Alexandria, where he nearly fell a victim to the intrigues of some of the courtiers and favourites of the king. Disgusted with this treatment, and despising the vices and luxury of Ptolemy, when he was again suffered to resume the command in Coele-Syria (219 BC) he conceived the design of betraying that province into the hands of Antiochus. His overtures were readily welcomed, and he surrendered the two important fortresses of Tyre and Ptolemais to the Seleucid monarch, whom he immediately joined with the forces under his command. Nicolaus however prevented his design from taking full effect, and retained a part of the Syrian provinces under the allegiance of Egypt. From this time Theodotus enjoyed a high place in the favour of the Syrian king. In the campaign of 217 BC we find him commanding a body of ten thousand select troops, and just before the battle of Raphia he gave a singular proof of daring by penetrating with only two companions into the heart of the Egyptian camp, in order to assassinate Ptolemy himself. Mistaking the king's tent, he slew his physician instead, but effected his escape in safety, and returned to the Syrian camp. Again in 215 BC we find him exhibiting equal audacity in supporting the daring project of Lagoras to scale the walls of the city of Sardis, the success of which seems to have been in great measure owing to his skill and ability.

Embodyment are a Christian metal band from Arlington, Texas (USA) which formed in 1993 and were first known by the name "Supplication".  They commenced as a death metal band and released 3 demos under this style, which later appeared altogether on a full-length release entitled , distributed by Solid State Records.  

Their debut album, "Embrace the Eternal", showed a change in style as Embodyment moved from death metal to mid-paced grindcore.  "Embrace the Eternal" also featured re-makes of the songs "Golgotha" and "Religious Infamy", which were originally from their demos.

After the departure of Kris McCaddon on vocals, Embodyment welcomed Sean Corbray on the album, "The Narrow Scope of Things", as permanent vocalist.  This album was the band's first step away from any of the heavier metal subgenres.  Instead, their sound on the album was adjusted to alternative metal with hard rock influences and was the first album to feature actual singing and some screamed vocal parts rather than any form of death vocals.

Embodyment's sound basically remained the same with the exception of a few minor tweaks and line-up changes until their last album, "Songs for the Living", which was also the only album released under XS Records.  It was on this album that Embodyment chose a different style of music altogether, as alternative/indie rock is definitely evident.

Embodyment later disbanded in early 2004 to the disappointment of loyal fans.

They have worked with Solid State Records and XS Records.

Andrew Godwin, Mark Garza and Kris McCaddon have finally resurfaced with a new band, The Famine

The ARP 2600 is a semi-modular analog subtractive audio synthesizer, designed by Alan R. Pearlman and manufactured by his company, ARP Instruments, Inc. Unlike other modular systems of the time, which required modules to be purchased individually and wired by the user, the 2600 was semi-modular with a fixed selection of basic synthesizer components internally pre-wired. The 2600 was thus ideal for musicians new to synthesis due to its ability to be operated either with or without patchcords, and was, upon its initial release, heavily marketed to high schools, universities, and other educational facilities.

Three versions of the ARP 2600 were built during ARP's lifetime. The first, dubbed the "Blue Meanie," housed in a light blue/grey metal case, was assembled in a garage during ARP's infancy as a company. Later ARP 2600s were built in a vinyl case and contained an imitation of Bob Moog's infamous 4-pole "ladder" VCF, later the subject of an infamous, threatened (though ultimately nonexistent) lawsuit. Finally, in order to fit in with the black/orange theme of ARP's other synthesizers, the ARP 2600s were manufactured with orange labels over a black plastic panel.

Alan R. Pearlman was just as innovative as a salesman as a synthesizer designer, as he gave away synthesizers to famous musicians, namely Edgar Winter,  Pete Townshend, Stevie Wonder, and Herbie Hancock, to supply ARP with free publicity. 

The enduring popularity of the ARP 2600 has led to software companies such as Arturia and Way Out Ware releasing software emulations for use with modern music equipment such as MIDI devices and computer sequencers. Although technology has progressed to the point where the ARP 2600 can be emulated fairly accurately, the idiosyncrasies of analogue circuitry make an exact replica arguably impossible.

<doc id="526706" title="Sonic the Comic" nonfiltered="269" processed="268" dbindex="450270">




Sonic the Comic, known to its many readers as STC, was a UK children's comic published fortnightly by Fleetway Editions (the merged companies Fleetway and London Editions, which progressively became integrated with its parent company Egmont until it became known as Egmont Magazines) between 1993 and 2002. It was the UK's official Sega comic, featuring stories about its mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, other Sega video game characters and some characters that appeared in Sega's consoles.

Format.
Sonic the Comics original price was  95 pence, increasing to £1.35 by the final issue. The comic generally had contained four comic strip stories, each usually following different storylines and being written and drawn by different writers and artists. The first was always a seven page story about Sonic himself (except for one issue which began with Tails instead), and in the earliest issues, the remaining three would involve a different Sega game character (see list below). As time rolled on, Sonic's influence spread, and the other strips were supplanted by supporting-character-based stories such as Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Chaotix, and the anthology "Sonic's World", which featured a variety of events in the STC world not covered by the main character strips.

Aside from the comic strips, for its first few years STC regularly featured content related to Sega videogaming. Fitting in with the Sonic convention of calling levels "Zones", these sections were given such titles as the "Q-Zone" (which featured videogame tips and cheats), the "News Zone" and the "Review Zone". Readers' artwork was printed in the "Graphic Zone", and letters were featured in "Speedlines". 

Megadroid.
The mascot of the comic was a robot named Megadroid, comprised of parts of a Sega Mega Drive. Megadroid was the persona used by the editors of Sonic the Comic to answer letters and provide story recaps and general magazine news (much like Tharg in 2000AD, and in fact created by former Tharg Richard Burton). He acted as a liaison between the readers (whom he called "boomers") and the "humes who think they're in charge".

Megadroid had a one-off strip, where he ran away from the STC offices to a seaside town only to return from his harrowing experience to attend to the needs of the boomers.

Megadroid was dropped from the comic in 1998, and with him the "Speedlines" letter page vanished. Speedlines returned in 2000, though was no longer a regular feature and the letters were supposedly answered by Sonic himself (actually editor Andy Diggle and later Steve MacManus).

As part of STC's unofficial fan-created revival in 2003, Megadroid was brought back, with a mid-section now made of a Nintendo GameCube.

Sonic-related stories.
Setting and history.
Sonic the Comic began its run with a series of fairly inconsequential one-shot stories, and only established its identity and ongoing storyline and setting with issue 8's "The Origin of Sonic". The comic adopted a version of the "Kintobor origin" of Sonic and Doctor Robotnik, which had originally been featured in a promotional comic for the first Sonic game printed in Disney Adventures and had been elaborated upon in Mike Pattenden's book Stay Sonic. Like other UK Sonic publications, STC used the Stay Sonic version as its basis. This origin story established that Sonic was originally a normal brown hedgehog, who burrowed his way into the underground laboratory of Dr. Ovi Kintobor, a scientist who wished to rid the planet Mobius of all evil through the use of powerful gems called the Chaos Emeralds. In addition, he helped Sonic increase his running speed using a special treadmill, until the hedgehog eventually broke the sound barrier with a sonic boom which turned him blue. However, an accident involving the unstable Chaos Emeralds and a rotten egg transformed Kintobor into the evil Dr Ivo Robotnik, leading to the events of the games Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The accident consisted of Kintobor accidentally knocking over a bottle of lemonade into a machine he was working on, that had the emeralds inside (while holding the egg), while he was explaning to Sonic what he was doing.

"The Origin of Sonic" led into a storyline in which Sonic, Tails and their friends were sent forward in time six months. During their absence, Doctor Robotnik had successfully conquered the entire planet of Mobius, and Sonic and co. were forced underground, operating as "freedom fighters" attempting to bring down Robotnik's rule of the planet. This situation remained until issue 100 (1997), when Robotnik was deposed.

The main strip of STC was always Sonic's own, chronicling the adventures he had both on his own and with his teammates, while the other three strips in the comic were a rotating series of stories based on popular Sega video games, usually six parts in length. As time went on, these strips dwindled and were phased out entirely in favour of other stories about Sonic and his friends and ememies, the first of which was a Tails solo series which saw him return to his home in the Nameless Zone, where it was believed that he was the great hero of Mobius, not Sonic, leading to misadventures there. In addition to Tails and Sonic, other members of the Freedom Fighters included Johnny Lightfoot and Porker Lewis, characters based upon the generic pig and rabbit sprites freed from Badniks in the video games. The team soon added the "Kintobor computer" to their ranks - an artificial intelligence based on the brain patterns of Doctor Robotnik's former self - and were later joined by Amy Rose, a female hedgehog infatuated with Sonic, whose lies about being his girlfriend had made her a target for Robotnik's forces. Robotnik himself was later redesigned to match the appearance of his Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series counterpart, and he gained a close ally in Grimer, his green-skinned chief scientist, who was instrumental in creating Metallix, the Metal Sonic, leading to the first major multi-part story in the comic, "The Sonic Terminator," itself an adaptation of the Sonic CD video game.

While "The Sonic Terminator" was STC's first adaptation of a video game, it was not their last. Knuckles the Echidna and his Floating Island soon made their debuts in the pages of the comic as Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was adapted, and the mysterious history of the ancient power objects, the Chaos Emeralds and their relation to Knuckles's lost race of Echidnas steadily began to unfold (see the gems' own article for full details). Instantly popular with readers, Knuckles was spun off into his own storylines in the comic, while new, original characters like sky-pirate Captain Plunder, rebellious super-Badnik Shortfuse the Cybernik and engineering genius Tekno the Canary were introduced, often in the anthology strip Sonic's World, and would in turn become popular enough that they would headline their own strips at times. One of the most far-reaching storylines of the comic was the adaptation of the Sonic and Knuckles game, which ultimately led into the introduction of the Chaotix Crew and the Brotherhood of Metallix, an army of Metal Sonics who had turned on Robotnik, and embarked on a plan to alter the timeline and take over Mobius.

One of STCs more innovative choices compared to other Sonic fiction was the use of Sonic's Chaos Emerald-induced powered-up form, Super Sonic, as a monstrous, inhibitionless alter-ego, the Mr. Hyde to Sonic's Doctor Jekyll. The appearances of Super Sonic were few and far between in the first eighty or so issues of the comic, making the character's eventual showings all the more impressive and special. Shortly after reappearing to combat Commander Brutus, a Badnik trooper programmed with Robotnik's own brain patterns who eventually led a revolution against this creator, exposure to more emerald power than ever made Super Sonic almost completely uncontrollable. When the Freedom Fighters transferred the chaos energy out of Sonic into the weird alternate dimension known as the Special Zone, Super Sonic continued to exist as a separate entity, forcing Sonic to pursue him. Using the dimension-hopping Omni-Viewer to freeze Super Sonic in time, Sonic was left with no way to return to Mobius and spent a brief period in the Special Zone, while Shortfuse joined the Freedom Fighters to keep them going and Knuckles ended his long quest back to the Floating Island. This ended when Super Sonic freed himself, his escape triggering a planet-wide electromagnetic pulse that the Omni-Viewer shunted to Mobius, deactivating Robotnik's computer systems and robots worldwide. In the comic's landmark 100th issue, with no technology or troops to protect him, Robotnik was finally deposed as Mobius's ruler, beginning a new stage in the storyline of Sonic the Comic.

After establishing the new state of play on Mobius - including the now-amnesiac Super Sonic's befriending of magician Ebony and psychic Pyjamas - STCs next major move was its adaptation of Sonic 3D Blast, which would prove to be the last game adaptation for a prolonged period of time. Although it ultimately amounted to little more than use of the different elements from the game (Flickies Island, the birds used for Badniks and dimensional travel via Mobius Rings), with the added introduction of a new Metallix villain (with its design based on Knuckles this time), it was a key stepping stone in shaping the direction of Sonic stories right up until the conclusion of the series. The story introduced the interdimensional alien race known as the Drakon Empire (spun out of a dangling plot point from nearly one hundred issues prior), who allied themselves with Doctor Robotnik in an attempt to acquire the Chaos Emeralds, revealing their previous ownership of the gems ages prior. Alliances, betrayals and double-crosses cumulated in Robotnik's successful capture of the Emeralds and a 4-issue epic in which he had god-like powers & reshaped Mobius entirely, but when his body was drained of Chaos Energy he vanished into a sub-atomic dimension. 

A series of dimension-hopping adventures by Amy and Tekno resulted in Mobius being briefly invaded by Earth military forces, after which Sonic pursued Grimer and Nack the Weasel in their quest to recover Robotnik. Trapped on the sub-atomic world of Shanazar, Sonic found it hard to adapt to the local culture, and when Amy's adventures led her to join him on the planet, the two explored the world's numerous vastly-different zones, combating myriad threats. Robotnik had his own plans, however, using the dimensional technology that brought Sonic, Grimer and Nack to Shanazar to enlarge the world, fusing it with Mobius in a Crisis on Infinite Earths-style event. Shanazar's zones could now be accessed from portals on Mobius, and various doorways had also opened to various points in Earth's history. Infuriated with yet another failure, however, Robotnik decided to bring his long war with Sonic to an end by destroying Mobius once and for all. Entering into a partnership with the living plastic alien hive-mind, The Plax, Robotnik used their technology to absorb elemental energy from both Mobius and Earth, forcing both worlds into total ecological collapse. His scheme was again foiled, however, by Shortfuse, who wired his armour into Robotnik's machine, undo the damage and draining the energy from the villain, with the added bonus of the feedback finally liberating him from his armour.

This proved to be one defeat too many for Robotnik - retreating physically and mentally, he languished in darkness, until Grimer, desperate to snap his master out of his depression, initiated the events of the comic's final storyline, the adaptation of Sonic Adventure (although in practice, this would prove to be the loosest game adaptation yet, as the game's wildly different approach was largely incompatible with the STC universe). Discovering a canister containing a creature of living chaos energy, Grimer unleashed the fear-inducing "Chaos" upon the Freedom Fighters, leading to the death of Johnny Lightfoot. Rampaging out of Grimer's control, Chaos then attacked the Floating Island, intended to absorb the Chaos Emeralds, but Knuckles jettisoned the emeralds before he could absorb more than one, causing the island itself to plunge into the ocean. While Robotnik then set about gathering the emeralds to lure all the players to his fortress that they might all die together, Sonic was transported into the ancient past of Mobius by Tikal and Pochacamac, two of the planet's race of echidnas, where he witnessed the beginning of the war between the Echidnas ans the Drakon Empire, the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, and the creation of Chaos, who proved to be a Drakon prosecutor, mutated by exposure to the emeralds. Returning to the present, Sonic arrived just as Chaos absorbed the remaining emeralds and became Perfect Chaos. Robotnik's suicide plan was thwarted, however, by the unexpected appearance of Super Sonic, dying due to depletion of his own chaos energy. Absorbing Chaos's energy, reverting him back to his Drakon form, Super Sonic became his old evil self again and turned on the Freedom Fighters, until Ebony used her magics to fused Sonic and Super Sonic back together again.

Sonic the Comics original stories came to an end at this point with issue #184, but the comic continued until #223 with reprinted material from throughout the magazine's life.

Characters.
Sonic the Hedgehog.
As the central protagonist and main character of the comic, Sonic was portrayed in his eponymous comic with an attitude which differs slightly compared to what is considered the norm in other media; here he is presented as being somewhat bossy, cocky and arrogant, and characters regularly referred to his "strange sense of humour". Sonic's attitude frequently made cruel jokes at the expense of his friend Tails, behavior contrary to that seen in most of the continuities. However, like all his incarnations, Sonic truly does care about his friends and their well-being, the same care also applies to his home planet of Mobius. Towards the end of the comic's run, with the death of Johnny Lightfoot, Sonic imposed a heavy blame upon himself; disgusted in how he'd kept his friends in the firing line for so many years. After a brief self-imposed exile, he returned to his friends with a much less self-centred attitude, and now more determined than ever.

Originally a resident of the Emerald Hill Zone, Sonic became friends with the benevolent scientist Dr. Ovi Kintobor and assisted in his experiments by running errands for him. He was present for most of the doctor's pivotal experiments, but didn't really pay much attention to them. Sonic's life took a bizarre turn when Kintobor directed his curiosity towards Sonic's running prowess (Sonic was fast even before gaining his blue hue), and attempted to measure what speed Sonic could reach under his own power. Kintobor gave him friction reducing trainers or "Power Sneakers" to help him run faster and put him in a kinetic gyratosphere (a spherical treadmill of sorts) to test Sonic's speed. The machine was started up and Sonic ran faster and faster in it until he reached the speed of sound, causing a sonic boom that blew up the machine with the colossal quantities of kinetic energy fusing Sonic's quills together and turning them a distinctly different blue colour.

Upon Kintobor's transformation into Dr. Robotnik, Sonic used his speed to battle against the madman's attempts at conquering Mobius. Sonic honed his skills using the various structures around the Emerald Hill Zone and soon learned to control his super-speed, allowing him to perform aerial feats and stunts. His signature move quickly became the "Sonic Spin Attack", which proved useful for destroying Badniks and Troopers, but he also employed many other techniques (such as creating a cocoon of speed to rip his opponents apart) over the years. He was frequently able to escape being held captive by discreetly vibrating the restraints with constant speed; eventually shaking them apart. He also displayed the ability to create a force field by vibrating the molecules in the air around him at supersonic speed.

He has a cover identity of "Bob Beaky", a heavily wrapped-up bird, where he uses for undercover work.

Non-Sonic stories.

When STC started out, three of the four strips in each issue originated from games other than Sonic. After a while, they were gradually replaced by Sonic spin-offs.

Shinobi (3 series) ;
Streets of Rage (3 series) ;
Kid Chameleon (2 series) ;
Eternal Champions (2 series) ;
Golden Axe (2 series) ;
Decap Attack (3 series, initially);
"Pirate STC" (1 series) ;
Marko's Magic Football (1 series) ;
Ecco the Dolphin (2 series) ;
Wonder Boy (2 series) ;
Sparkster Knight Adventures (1 series) ;
Mutant League Football (1 series) ;
Shining Force (1 series) ;
"Megadroid" (2 series);

Of these, "Pirate STC" and the "Megadroid" strips was the only ones not to be based on an existing video game; "Pirate STC" was based on a series of adverts for the Sega Mega Drive and Mega CD, while the "Megadroid" strips were based on the host robot of Sonic the Comic. 

Decap Attack.
Decap Attack was an adaptation of a Mega Drive game. The strip became very popular and outlasted all the other non-Sonic strips (partly because the editor liked it), becoming Nigel Kitching's pet project.

Staff.
The bulk of the work in the comic was written by either Nigel Kitching or Lew Stringer, while art was provided by Richard Elson, Nigel Dobbyn, Carl Flint, Woodrow Phoenix, Roberto Corona, Mike McMahon, Kitching himself and many others. 

Several of the comic's writers and artists have since had success elsewhere. Mark Millar, who wrote the first Streets of Rage storyline and some Sonic strips, has since written major titles for DC and Marvel Comics such as The Authority and Ultimate X-Men; occasional cover contributor Dermot Power has worked as a concept artist on several Hollywood films; and Road to Perdition illustrator Richard Rayner contributed to Decap Attack scripts.

Demise.
The demise of STC began when budget cuts at the comic led to the number of pages being cut from 36 to 32 in 1997 and as a result, the loss of the news, game review and game tips sections. Despite being one of Fleetway's biggest selling comics in 1998 (at one point that year it was outselling 2000AD), from issue 133, published that July, one strip an issue was given over to reprints to save money as part of Fleetway's policy of five-year reader cycles (issue 133 was published shortly after the comic's 5th birthday). Later in the year, the mascot Megadroid was removed, along with the "Speedlines" letters page. Two more strips were later replaced by reprints, leaving just the main strip and the cover as the only new material from issue 157 (issues 155 and 156 had 2 new stories, though this was merely to let the existing Amy and Tekno story draw to a close). With only one new strip an issue, this meant there were no new supporting character strips, the main strip being the only new material in the comic. The reprints policy meant Kitching was supposed to share the main strip with Lew Stringer, causing the plans for the Shanazar arc to be heavily altered.

During this time, the main strip's stories came under the "Time Zone" banner, mostly being set on Shanazar and then later involving dimensional portals leading to other dimensions & Earth's history (identical to the previous Amy & Tekno stories) due to editorial preference. This was highly unpopular with many fans as neither Mobius nor any of the main characters bar Sonic & Amy featured, and the lack of anciliary strips meant no other stories could be told, with Richard Elson's artwork also arguably at its lowest point. Lew Stringer was the comic's sole writer during this period, Nigel Kitching having being sacked after issue 157 (returning with issue 175 after a change in editor).

Despite an apocalyptic final story by Stringer and a much-lauded comeback by Kitching in 2000, Egmont made the decision for the comic to be fully reprint from issue 185 - although these still had new covers, drawn by Richard Elson who was the sole artist in the final issues. This happened at short notice   even Kitching wasn't aware that issue 184 would be his last until he requested an extension for the ten-issue storyline he was in the middle of writing, having apparently already made plans for future stories that would follow it. He revealed the cancellation to fans on the STC Mailing list on April 19, 2000   a little over two months before the last issue was published, and only a few weeks after he himself had been made aware of the fact. As a result, the final story ended with a handful of loose ends from earlier stories left untied.

Fully-reprint issues continued to be published until issue 223, which reprinted the four-part storyline "The Evil Empire" and featured an article by Nigel Kitching about his time working on the comic, an abridged version of that had appeared on the Mailing List.

Related publications.
In addition to Sonic the Comic, nine issues of Sonic the Poster Mag were published. This comic consisted of an A1-sized poster, on the reverse of which was printed a comic strip in A4-sized sections. The poster was folded to match the pages of the comic. Most of the stories were based around Sonic, but one was devoted to Shinobi and another to Streets of Rage. Issues 1 & 2 were not strips. Issue 1 contained info on the two cartoon series (AOSTH and SatAM) and Issue 2 was game tips on Sonic Chaos.

In 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1999 Sonic Summer Specials were published. The 1995 issue consisted mainly of reprinted material from Sonic the Poster Mag, and the 1999 edition was entirely reprints. In addition, in 1996 the Knuckles Knock-Out Special was printed, containing material devoted to Sonic's "friendly rival".

 Sonic the Comic Online . 

Sonic the Comic - Online! (or STC-O! as it is commonly referred to) is an unofficial web-based continuation of Sonic the Comic.  The strips continue the adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and his group of Freedom Fighters from where Nigel Kitching's Chaos Arc left off back in Issue #184. STC-O!'s first issue starts at #224, because the original STC started fully reprinting old strips from #185 to #223, meaning there is a huge "gap" in these issues with no new material other than the covers.

Many notable events have taken place thus far in the Online comic. The long missing Dr. Zachary was established as the primary villain for the opening issues of the comic, freeing the mysterious echidna known as Vichama, waking Shadow the Hedgehog and ordering the latter to destroy the Special Zone. Tikal the Echidna also returned, and has lost her memories of the Ancient Echidna race, much to Knuckles regret, and currently resides on the Floating Island. The destruction of the Special Zone has also had seemingly further reaching reprecussions in the introduction of The Family, a group of Mafia-style insects led by the mysterious Don Long-Legs, who appear to have designs on both the Freedom Fighters and Mobius itself.

The comic does not have the backing of either Egmont Fleetway or Sega, but many of the original STC writers and artists have praised the website and backed its continuation (Nigel Kitching is also an occasional contributor to the site's message boards). Thus, it is considered among STC fans as "unofficially official" - the closest to an official continuation there is ever likely to be. It was even in the running for the Diamond National Comics Award for Best Online Strip, 2004 - coming in second place to the officially-licensed Matrix Comics.

Thus far, the series has reached its 240th issue via this continuation and has introduced the popular game characters Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat and even, in issue #240, the older, one-time character, Bean the Dynamite.

STC-O is also home to the Message Zone, a forum home to thousands of members. Originally starting as a place to discuss the latest online issues, the forum has grown considerably, adding more boards, and more areas of talk.

During World War I, Heward lived in England where her brothers served in the Canadian army while she served as a volunteer with the Red Cross. Returning to Canada at war's end, she continued her painting and joined the Beaver Hall Hill Group. In 1924 her works were given their first public showing at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in Toronto, Ontario. However, it was still an era when women artists were given little credibility and it wasn't until 1932 that Heward's first solo exhibition came at the Scott Gallery in Montréal.

Wanting to refine her skills, and drawn to the great gathering of creative genius in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France, between 1925 and 1926 Prudence Heward lived and painted in Paris. While studying at the Académie Colarossi, she frequented Le Dome Café in Montparnasse, the favorite haunt of North American writers and artists and the place where Canadian writer Morley Callaghan came with his friends Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. 

While in Paris, Heward met Ontario painter Isabel McLaughlin with whom she became friends and would later join with her and other artists on nature painting trips. In 1929 her career got a major boost when her painting, Girl on a Hill, won the top prize in the Governor General Willingdon competition organized by the National Gallery of Canada. 

She was invited to exhibit with the Group of Seven and through it became friends with A. Y. Jackson with whom she would go on sketching excursions along the Saint Lawrence River. While she did a number of landscapes, with a particular attachment for Quebec's Eastern Townships, Heward is most recognized for her portraits that provide compelling representations of women and children including the five nude subjects she painted of which four were black women.

In 1933, Prudence Heward co-founded the Canadian Group of Painters, but her struggle with asthma and other health problems eventually slowed her down. A 1939 automobile accident curtailed her abilities further but she still produced some outstanding portraits until 1945 when her health had deteriorated to the point where she had to give up painting. She died two years later, while seeking medical treatment in Los Angeles, California.

Today, works by Prudence Heward can be found in several Canadian galleries including the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts and at the National Gallery of Canada.

In 1996, her cousin, politician Heward Grafftey, wrote "Chapter Four: Prudence Heward" for the book Portraits of a Life.

Adobogiona (fl. c. 80-c. 50 BCE) was a Celtic Galatian princess.

The daughter of Deiotarus and sister to Brogitarus, princess of the Tolistobogii tribe, she was also cousin to King Deiotarus, the famous adherent of Pompey the Great. Adobogiona became the wife of Menodotus, a wealthy patrician citizen of Pergamum, in Asia Minor. Their son Mithridates of Pergamum (c. 80-41 BCE) was the friend and ally of Julius Caesar, who appointed him as tetrarch over there Trocmi tribe shortly before his assassination in 44 BCE. Adobogiona was hounoured by a surviving inscription uncovered on the island of Lesbos, and her portrait head has been discovered at Pergamum.

Valley Comprehensive School is situated in Worksop, United Kingdom. The current Headmaster is Brian Rossiter.

History.

Valley was originally called Bentinck Secondary Modern. A pupil's result from the eleven plus determined which secondary school in Worksop you could attend. Those thought suitable for either an academic or technical education went sent to Portland Comprehensive and others received training in simple, practical skills at Bentinck.

Pupils were first admitted into Bentinck on 19th September 1957, but the schools official opening wasn't until 1960. Some of the buildings such as the Hall are the same today as they were then. Bentinck's first headmaster was Mr Wade and the deputy was Mr Taylor.

Pupils were taught Maths, English, Science, Geography, History, R.E., Music, Art and P.E. Boys took Metalwork, Woodwork, and Technical Drawing, whereas the girls learnt Cooking and Needlework.

The uniform for the girls consisted of a short, grey skirt (or a green and white striped dress in winter), a green and white striped shirt, a bottle-green v-neck, navy jumper and blazer. Boys wore grey trousers, a white shirt and a bottle-green blazer.

Throughout the years, movies and television have taken liberties with reality in the interest of good visuals and larger than life characters.  The effects of these special effects and the tendency for humans to believe what they see have created a multitude of myths regarding firearms.  These range from how firearms operate to their effects down range.  Some of these myths may be dangerous if imitated.

Operation.
 Hammerless pistols like the Glock may be cocked as they are drawn.  Since John Browning included a concealed hammer on the M1903 Colt Hammerless, exposed hammers are not a necessity.  These pistols, cannot be cocked or recocked without manually operating the slide.

 A bolt-action rifle fires semi-automatic, such as in Anaconda (film).  Bolt action rifles, except for a very unusual double barreled repeater costing $50,000 USD, can not fire more than one shot without the bolt being manipulated to extract the empty casing, cock the action, and load a new round into the chamber.  Even the Fuchs repeater has only a single extra round before needing to be manually cycled.

 Silencers may be used on revolvers. Almost all revolvers contain a gap between the cylinder and the barrel.  Explosive energy and noise escape through this gap when the round is fired. There are few exceptions.  The Nagant M1895 revolver, a late 19th century Russian service revolver, can and has been silenced because the cylinder is cammed forward during the firing process to create a gas seal.  Customized revolvers using rounds that encapsulate the propellant and a muzzle mounted suppressor have also been created for extremely specialized situations.

 Machine guns such as the heavy M60 can be accurately fired from the hip with one hand as the other arm guides the ammunition belt, such as in the Rambo movies.  These weapons fire full power rifle ammunition with full power recoil.  The recoil tends to force the gun away from any point of aim unless tightly controlled.  This results in extremely poor accuracy unless firing distances are very short.

 Pistols can be fired sideways accurately, as seen on many "gangsta" films and videos. This will result in poor accuracy and is not used by experienced shooters under normal circumstances.  Ironically, some experimental evaluations have found that holding a pistol at a 45° angle may be as accurate and allow quicker, aimed follow up shots than a pistol held vertically.  This technique was used with the late 80s early 90s Berettas because the shooter could catch hot brass in the eye if held normally, it was then adopted by the "gangsta" lifestyle. Sideways firing was also used in drive-by shootings because it required a minimal window gap and therefore reduced the chance that casings would fall outside of the car.

 The M1 Garand cannot be reloaded mid-clip. This is especially true in many video games, including but not limited to Day of Defeat: Source, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor. In actuality you can remove the previous magazine by pulling the bolt back, extracting the previously loaded cartridge (and inevitably drop the extracted round.., pressing down the magazine catch (which actually isn t pressed downwards, but from left side towards right) and removing the clip, then inserting a new clip. (Note that when removing a partially emptied clip, you are very likely to drop the remaining cartridges on the floor, as the cartridges are held in place in the clip only when full). This is not a quick process, and the process is quite likely to result in one ending up with a thumb painfully caught in the lock, but it is definitely possible to reload.

Magazines can be "refilled" when half-full. Many video games allow the player to refill the amount of ammunition in a weapon's magazine using the same motion one would use to load a new magazine. In reality, one would have to either discard the partially loaded magazine and the ammunition along with it, or be left with a half-empty magazine. In order to refill magazines, one would either consolidate multiple half-empty magazines into a smaller number of full ones by transferring ammunition between magazines, or load loose rounds into the magazine(s). Both are time-consuming processes.

 A semi-automatic handgun can be unloaded by removing the magazine. Some handguns may have a "magazine safety" that prevents the gun from firing when the magazine is removed, but most do not. You must remove the magazine, clear the chamber and preferably lock back the slide to check both by touch and sight to ensure a gun is unloaded. Even when the gun is completely without ammunition, negligence is considered very rude, undisciplined and embarrassing, and usually considered threatening. Gun safety is important, because most non-intentional gun firing incidents involving personal injury and/or property destruction also involve negligent gun handling; non-intentional discharges are referred to as "negligent discharges", as true accidents are extremely rare.

 Glocks can be fired underwater, as claimed in U.S. Marshals The average Glock is extremely dangerous to fire underwater, as the striker is slowed by the pressure of water and thus can simply fail to fire, or when using higher pressure loads such as .40 S&W or .357SIG or hollowpoint rounds, pressure can increase beyond acceptable limits and cause the gun to explode.  Only the rare Glock 17 Mariner variant, or a Glock 17 fitted with special maritime spring cups and using standard pressure ball ammunition, allows safe firing underwater.  Even then, the range and power is very limited, with penetration of   inch thick pine at 10 feet considered a good point.  The sound amplification effect of water is also worthy of consideration, meaning that if the shooter's head is underwater, the shot will be many times louder than normal and hence likely to damage hearing permanently.

 Fully-automatic fire. There are many myths about fully-automatic firearms, from the effects to the usage and purpose. In reality, world militaries and police forces discourage full automatic fire because of its tendency to waste ammunition while achieving very few hits and potentially overheating the weapon (even going so far as to strip the full auto option on military weapons as in the latest incarnations of the American M16). Instead, the fully automatic mode on rifle and machine guns is most often used for suppressive fire, utilizing short bursts to prevent an enemy from advancing or accurately returning fire. Submachine guns are a different case in that they are used primarily for short range, close quarters engagements where their high rate of fire and low recoil make them much more controllable on fully automatic fire than weapons chambered for full power rifle cartridges. Even so, submachine gun tactics also employ short bursts on a general area of the target to overcome their low power and ensure at least several hits. A combatant firing any weapon on fully automatic for the entirety of the magazine's capacity will likely miss with the majority of their shots and inflict a large amount of collateral damage unless the target is extremely close and the shooter has good control of the weapon. In short, many films and video games have distorted public perception of what automatic fire can do and what it was designed for.

Ammunition Use and Effects.

 Bullets can be stopped by items such as car doors, windshields (which can deflect depending on the angle fired and range along with what caliber), chairs, bath tubs, etc. Most will be penetrated quite easily with common pistol and rifle rounds.  Some deviation in flight path while penetrating glass is a common.  Typical household interior walls present very little obstacle to even small caliber handgun rounds.  However, light .223 Remington hollow point bullets have been shown to stop after penetrating a single interior wall.  By comparison, the 7.62mm NATO specification rounds used by the North Hollywood bank robbers were shown to have penetrated an exterior wall and multiple interior walls.

 40mm grenades can be detonated at close ranges. In actuality they have a pre-set distance before becoming armed in most current rounds to avoid detonating while the shooter is still in the casualty radius.  One specific subtype of fuse will arm itself after 3-5m, but these are not common and endanger the firer in close quarters.

 Entire rounds, casing and bullet included, exit the barrel, such as in Major Payne the title character offers a .22 LR round to his date saying he pulled it out of his heart when a man shot him. The round is clearly intact and is not the typical bullet used by most militaries. The Simpsons tend to also show this quite often throughout the series.  The casing is used to carry the propellant and bullet into the weapon.  Once it is detonated, the bullet leaves the casing via the barrel and the casing is ejected when the weapon is cycled via the ejection port.

 Black Talon rounds will tear through body armor and are "Cop-Killer" bullets. Seen on Law & Order: SVU. Winchester's Black Talon JHP rounds have no special capability against body armor.  As a matter of fact, they are designed to rapidly expand on impact decreasing their ability to penetrate bullet resistant armor.  The National Institute of Justice, who sets standards for law enforcement body armor, specifically employs full metal jacketed (FMJ) bullets in testing as they tend to outpenetrate hollow points in most calibers.  ;

 Hollow-point rounds making massive exit wounds. It is true that they expand but definitely not to the degree usually depicted.

 A person being shot is sent flying. This would be impossible since it would send the shooter flying from the recoil. As stated in Newton's laws of motion: "Every motion has an equal and opposite reaction."  It has been documented using various techniques that even the huge .50 Browning Machine Gun round does not have sufficient energy to knock a person backwards.  Mathematically feasible, it is impossible for a bullet and a human body to collide inelastically and in a manner that transfers the bullets energy to the body completely.  Above a certain point, the bullet transfers only part of its energy and exits the body with the rest.(It should be noted, however, that muscular reactions exist which cause the body to jerk away from a chest injury. While such reactions will not cause the body to go flying, they may, under some circumstances, cause some backward movement.);

 All bullets having almost the same level of stopping power. As seen in the Death Wish series.  Handgun rounds can be divided into various performance classes, and performance within those classes are roughly similar.  However, the difference between a "pocket gun caliber" such as the .25 ACP and a "magnum handgun caliber" such as the .44 Magnum is pronounced.  Still, even relatively powerful handguns depend on careful bullet placement for immediate results in a self-defense situation.

 Dum-Dum rounds have a greater stopping power. In general, expanding rounds tend to be more effective than rounds that do not expand.  Modern JHP self-defense ammunition is carefully tailored to provide a good balance between penetration and expansion based on studies by various law-enforcement organizations.

 5.56mm rounds are "buzz-saw" bullets that tear through a person before tumbling inside them. Most high velocity rifle once slowed by impacting human tissue begin to yaw and tumble expending their energy creating a large internal wound.  Depending on the location of the impact and the velocity of the bullet (and bullet design), this yawing may not occur in all wounds.  Accuracy is not generally impacted.

Common Myths on Common Guns.

Glock pistols will not be detected by metal detectors. This myth was publicized in the movie "Die Hard II" when John McClane made a comment about the nonexistant "Glock 7".  This is corrected in the movie Lord of War when Yuri sells a drug lord a Glock and mentions that this is not true and not to attempt it. Glock handguns use steel slides and barrels, and though the frame largely consists of synthetic material, it does have molded in metal guide rails which would be impossible to remove without destroying the firearm. This means that none of the Glock's vital parts could pass through a metal detector undetected. Though the one in the movie is supposed to be entirely plastic.

S&W Model 29 .44 Magnum is the "Most powerful handgun in the world." as mentioned in Dirty Harry. The .44 Magnum is not a handgun, but rather a cartridge. It was the most powerful in the world until 1959, in which it was superseded by the .454 Casull . The .500 S&W is the current holder of the "most powerful commercially manufactured handgun cartridge" title.

 M16's are notoriously unreliable. This was true for the M-16 issued during Vietnam due to a variety of reasons. Cleaning kits were not issued due to the erroneous advertising that the weapon was self-cleaning.  In addition, the military changed the type of powder used over the objections of the designer--this resulted in more fouling than anticipated. While not as reliable as many other military rifles, most problems have been remedied and M16s are generally reliable if kept clean and maintained properly.  The M16A4 is now the standard issue and older models of the M16 are being phased out.

 Bullet-proof vests render a person invulnerable to most rounds. There is no such thing as a completely "bullet-proof" vest. However, there is body armor that offers protection against pistol and shotgun rounds (to a degree). Rifle rounds punch through normal body armor except for Armor plates designed for rifle rounds. It should be noted that multiple shots can ensure penetrating and there is still the case of severe bruising or broken bones with armor.

Barrett .50 BMG sniper rifles can be used by terrorists to shoot down commercial jets. Although .50 BMG weapons are very powerful compared to other small arms, the cartridge's power is not adequate to cripple a large airplane by sheer impact alone. Most major air forces stopped using .50 caliber machine guns in their fighter aircraft shortly after World War II for this reason.  Furthermore, all modern jet airliners have two or more engines, two pilots, and emergency backups for all vital systems.  Shooting down an airliner with a .50 BMG weapon would require at least two (and probably more) hits to vital aircraft parts or the flight crew- a highly unlikely proposition. Hitting a stationary target once at 1,000 yard range (if one was to hypothetically ignore the altitude of most aircraft) is difficult enough. One could possibly hit a plane landing or taking off but that in itself would be a great challenge. Also, the cost of the rifle and the ammunition alone would deter anyone but the most well-funded group; RPGs are less expensive and better suited for such purposes. This rifle and round is used mostly for anti-materiel purposes in the military, and long-distance target shooting and big game hunting (notably bear) in the civilian market.

The Battle of Baxter Springs, sometimes called the Baxter Springs Massacre, was a minor battle of the American Civil War, fought on October 6, 1863, near the modern-day town of Baxter Springs, Kansas.

In late 1863, the guerrilla band of Quantrill's Raiders travelled south from Kansas along the Texas Road to winter in Texas. Numbering about 400, this group captured and killed two Union teamsters who had come from small Federal Army post called Fort Blair. 

Quantrill decided to attack Fort Blair and divided his force into two columns, one under him and the  other commanded by a subordinate, David Poole. Poole and his men proceeded down the Texas Road, where they encountered Union soldiers, most of whom were African Americans. They chased and attacked the Union troops, killing some of them before they reached the earth and log fort. 

Poole's column then attacked Fort Blair, but the garrison fought them off with the aid of a howitzer. Quantrill's column moved on the post from another direction and happened to encounter a Union detachment escorting Maj. Gen. James G. Blunt as he was in the process of moving his command headquarters from Fort Scott to Fort Smith. 

Most of this detachment, including the military band, Maj. Henry Z. Curtis (son of Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis), and Johnny Fry (first official westbound rider of the Pony Express) was killed,  but Blunt and a few mounted men escaped and returned to Fort Scott. Blunt was removed  from command for failing to protect his column, but he was soon restored. Touted as a massacre by some, Baxter Springs was another of the events  that characterized the vicious Kansas-Missouri border warfare.

Bulat-Bat r or Bulat-batyr (Russian:       -      , Tatar:           ) is a silent film, believed to be the first Tatar film and probably the only Tatar full-length feature silent film. The film was shot mostly in Kazan, and Kazan Kremlin was one of it's stills. The film is devoted to Pugachev rebellion and its alternative name is Pugachyovshchina (Russian:            ).

The story was written by Abdraxman  akirov, a young Communist from Agryz and the script was written by Natan Zarhi, a famous Soviet scenario writer.

Plot. 
The 18th century. A small Tatar village celebrate Sabantuy festival. Orthodox monks accompanied by soldiers appear to forcibly baptize the population of the village. Locals resist and soldiers commit a punitive action. The wife of peasant Bulat is killed by soldiers, his son Asfan is carried off. Bulat stays alone with his another son, Asma. 15 years after Bulat and Asma joined Pugachev rebellion and Bulat became famous as a defender of paupers. But his son Asfan, who was reared among nobles, get a commission and lead a punitive force, directed to suppress a rebellion in his motherland. 
Other facts.
It is known that after the premiere in Germany one White émigré Antonov-Ivanov managed to climb to the film projector and to destroy a film.

Digvijay Singh is a senior Congress (I) politician in India and has been the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh state for two five-year terms. He was born on February 28, 1947 in the royal family of Raghogarh principality, in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh. He first became Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on December 7, 1993 and continued to hold the post till Congress was voted out of power in the November 2003 State Assembly elections in the state. He is popularly known as Diggi Raja. 

Academic life.
He is a product of the Daly college ,indore,a public school established in 1882 . He is an engineering graduate from SGSITS in Indore. He is also a St. Stephen's College, Delhi alumni.

Political career.
He joined politics at the age of 24. He became the President of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee in the year 1984. In 1980, he was elected Member of State Legislative Assembly. He became a Minister of State and later a Cabinet Minister under the MP Government headed by Arjun Singh in 1980-84. He was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1984 and 1991. He has been representing his hometown and constituency (Raghogarh) for many years in the State Assembly elections. However, the man known as "Diggy Raja" to his admirers as well as to his foes, was humiliated badly in the Madhya Pradesh State Assembly Election in December 2003, wherein the Congress was reduced to a strength of 37 members in a house of 230. The BJP captured power with a landslide mandate, securing a mammoth 173 seats. Interestingly, Digvijay Singh had vowed publicly and repeatedly not to take part in active politics for 10 years if he did not win the December 2004 elections. However, he did not keep his word and returned to politics after a very brief break. Ever since his career has just gone from bad to worse. He was appointed the Bihar in charge for the Congress in the November 2005 elections and claimed credit for forging a better alliance with Laloo Yadav than in the Feb 2005 elections. However, all his gambits backfired as the Congress was decimated in the elections, its strength falling to 8 (from 9) in a 243 member assembly. The election also marked a dramatic end to Laloo Yadav, one of India's most enigmatic and rustic politicians.

 Controversy .

In year 2001 Income tax authorties seized a diary from a liquor baron .They found the names of several officials and politicians of the state and money written against their names in the diary. There was one entry with just CM against the amount .It was not known and not found out of what state the CM the diary entry referred to. Digvijay Singh was chief minister then. He later promoted many officials whose names were figured in the diary to higher posts.

Maire Caitlin Brennan is an American writer and performer born in Phoenix, Arizona on February 14, 1969.

 Background .
Brennan achieved minor regional success in film, television, music and radio as Mike Sortino before beginning a gender transition in the late 1980s. 
 
Brennan's first media exposure came as early as 1977, when she was a regular guest on Phoenix's KARZ-960 radio's "Let's Talk" program hosted by Bob Reidy, as the self-appointed "Official Representative from Constitution School." She generally provided wide-ranging (often unsolicited) "little professor" commentary to the amusement of the host and listeners.
 
Later, Brennan became a locally-recognized figure thanks to comical self-promotion stunts and prodigious work in stage, film, television, music and writing. Since the mid-1990s, she has primarily devoted herself to work as a writer, but periodically returns to acting, music and filmmaking.

Brennan is the daughter of noted session and touring musician Ron Dobbins, and the great-granddaughter of Ida Mae Bell Owen, a legendary seamstress who designed racing silks used in thoroughbred horse racing. Owen, her husband Bryan Wald Owen and daughter Parthenia were accomplished musicians who toured the midwest in the 1930s and 1940s. Bryan Wald Owen and his sister Mabel Owen were popular vaudevillians in the early 1900s.
 

 Film, Television and Theatre Work .
During high school and college, Brennan directed and starred in several short films including The Mike And Eric Movie, Spam Animals and The Man Called Bear: Hero At Large. A sporadic theatre, film and television acting career soon followed, including appearances in local commercials, independent features and bit parts in national productions such as Midnight Caller, The Doors, Northern Exposure and perhaps somewhat ironically, the 1985 feature Just One Of The Guys.  

Brennan began writing plays in high school, and several of her surreal one-act plays were produced in high school, college and community theatre productions. During the 1990s, challenged by the personal and societal difficulties inherent in gender transition, she made limited acting appearances, and while she remained a prolific writer, only a small portion of that material has been published or performed.
 
In 2000, Brennan resumed film work in earnest, directing Grandma Shoots, Grandma Scores, starring 99-year old basketball star (and Brennan's real-life great-grandmother) Mae Owen. In 2002, Brennan received the Arizona Commission on the Arts Screenwriting fellowship, and the following year, she won the Phoenix Film Festival's Best Screenplay award. In February 2006, Brennan filmed a brief appearance as a "lesbian Martha Stewart" in Jamie Babbit's feature film Itty Bitty Titty Committee, scheduled for release in early 2007. In September 2006, she was named a semifinalist in the Austin Film Festival screenwriting competition. Also in 2006, it was announced that Brennan would helm a feature-length documentary film on Phoenix's legendary Wallace and Ladmo Show.

 Fiction .
Brennan's first locally acclaimed writing was a 1980 serialized adventure, "The Adventures of Ziggle and Zod", which incorporated elements of science fiction, comedy, secret agent fiction and nonsequiter comedy. The stories established Brennan's hallmark style of incorporating both subtle and overt rapid-fire comedic references to literature, comics, film, television, history and politics. Soon thereafter, Brennan created The Dastardly Communist Plot, a genre-busting "pulp spectacular" about a group of misfit heroes led by a rock singer/superscientist/teenage loser that predated The Adventures Of Buckaroo Banzai by several years. It also spoofed the James Bond / Derek Flint secret agent/supervillain archetypes (indestructible characters, bizarre weaponry, evil cats) and settings (volcanic island, moonbase, space station) eerily similar to those used 15 years later in the Austin Powers films. Brennan eventually wrote four books in the series, which also drew from Paul Ryan O'Connor's fictionalized adventures of friend and mentor James "Bear" Peters, a writer and role-playing game designer known in gaming circles as The Man Called Bear. In 1983, Brennan directed a short film based on this material, The Man Called Bear: Hero At Large!

In high school, Brennan won numerous state journalism awards from the Arizona Interscholastic Press Association, and in 1986 won first place in the Journalism Education Association's national feature write-off. In 1988 Brennan became one of the inaugural music writers for the Zia Zine, the in-house music magazine of the Zia Records chain. Freelance writing jobs followed, as well as serialized novels, stage plays and other material.
 
In 2001, Brennan developed the "Comic Newsbriefs" news parody feature for Don Kahle's famed Comic News, based in Eugene, Oregon. During 2002 and 2003, she was also the sports columnist for Phoenix's ECHO magazine.

 Music career .
Brennan's music career began in earnest in 1986 with the release of an independent cassette, Last Gasp. A peripheral character in the Phoenix and Tempe music scene that spawned Galen Herod, Tone Set, Dead Hot Workshop and the Gin Blossoms, Brennan recorded several more independent cassettes during the 1980s.
 
For much of her career, Brennan's music was only available on cassette sold at shows, through "mail art" or cassette subculture zines, and she was often known to customize each cassette with unique performances and reworkings of her music, cover songs, commentary, sound collages and occasional pranks. Although titles and cover art are often uniform, virtually no two cassettes from the mail-order era are identical and no "master" was kept.

In the 1990s, she lived and performed in San Francisco and later Seattle, making folk-pop music in the vein of Townes Van Zandt, Elliot Smith, Harry Nilsson, Aimee Mann and early David Bowie, and recording the independent CDs M. C. Brennan (etc) in 1994, San Francisco Sessions (produced by former James Brown producer Susie Foot) in 1995 and Black Diamond in 1997. 

A small amount of post-2000 material has appeared for download on Brennan's now-defunct MP3.com page and file sharing networks, but nothing has been officially released.

 The Loons and the Loon News .
The leader of a Phoenix DIY improv comedy/performance art collective called The Loons, Brennan began directing short films in 1982 and the following year, in collaboration with cartoonist Eric Paul Johnson, she founded a satirical "underground newspaper" called the Loon News, a forerunner of The Onion. The Loon News became popular among Arizona teens, and distribution expanded to several other cities including Boston, Massachusetts and Hawthorne, California. Many of the original Loons still remain in close contact, and the Loon News is still in production.

 Trivia .
 
Brennan is a direct descendant of Alexander Graham Bell and an extremely distant cousin of Michael Nesmith of The Monkees.

In 1985, she appeared on KPNX-TV's "Finn and Friends" program with Weird Al Yankovic.

Brennan can be briefly seen in U2's feature documentary Rattle and Hum.

Brennan is no relation to Irish singer Maire Brennan. She has described the similar names as a coincidence.

In 2005, she posed for photographer Jana Marcus' acclaimed photojournalism project Transfigurations, documenting the lives and stories of transgendered men and women. In 2006 the touring show appeared in San Jose, San Francisco and Buffalo, New York, and opens at the I Gallery in New York City in early 2007.

Glenlyon Archibald Campbell (October 3, 1863   October 22, 1917) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.  He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1903 to 1908, and in the Canadian House of Commons from 1908 to 1911.  Campbell was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.

Campbell was born at Fort Pelly, in what was then known as the Northwest Territories.  His father, Robert Campbell, was a Scotsman who served as Chief Factor for the Hudson Bay Company, the dominant power in the region.  The younger Campbell was educated at Glasgow Academy and the Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh, and worked as a farmer and rancher upon returning to Canada.  He helped to establish the community of Gilbert Plains in 1884, after purchasing the first house constructed in the community from Gilbert Ross (for whom the community is named).

He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the 1892 provincial election as a support of the opposition Conservative Party, and lost to Theodore Arthur Burrows by nine votes in Dauphin.  Burrows described himself as a "Liberal-Conservative", but endorsed the Liberal government of Thomas Greenway; he later joined the Liberal Party outright.  Campbell lost to Burrows again in the 1896 election, by twelve votes.

He was first elected to the legislature in the 1903 election, defeated a Liberal candidate by 202 votes in Gilbert Plains.  He served as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Palen Roblin's government, and was re-elected without opposition in the 1907 election.

Campbell resigned from the provincial legislature in 1908 to campaign in the 1908 federal election.  Contesting the riding of Dauphin, he defeated his old nemesis Theodore Arthur Burrows in 217 votes to win the seat.  The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election under Wilfrid Laurier, and Campbell served as an opposition member for the next three years.

He lost his seat to Liberal Robert Cruise by 748 votes in the 1911 election, even as the Conservative Party won a majority government under Robert Borden.  He died six years later.

John Goodricke (September 17 1764   April 20 1786) was an eminent and profoundly deaf amateur astronomer. He was born in Groningen in the Netherlands, but lived most of his life in England. He was named after his grandfather Sir John Goodricke.

He is best known for his observations of the variable star Algol (Beta Persei) in 1782. ('Variable' means that it appears to turn 'on and off'.) 

Although several stars were already known to vary in apparent magnitude, Goodricke was the first to propose a mechanism to account for this. He suggested that Algol is what is now known as an eclipsing binary. He presented his findings to the Royal Society in May 1783, and for this work, the Society awarded him the Copley Medal for that year. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on April 16 1786. He never learned of this honour however, as he died four days later, probably from pneumonia.

Goodricke was profoundly deaf through most of his life, due to scarlet fever in early childhood. His parents sent him to Thomas Braidwood's Academy, a school for the deaf in Edinburgh, and then, in 1778, to the Warrington Academy. 

After leaving the Academy, he returned to live with his parents in York. There, he became friends with Edward Pigott, whose father Nathaniel Pigott had built a sophisticated private observatory. Edward was already interested in variable stars, and he gave Goodricke a list of those that he thought were worthy of observation.

Between October 2005 and March 2006, Sean Ellingham and James Valner from the University of York undertook a project to find the position of Goodricke's observatory using the data he recorded. A 1949 study by Sidney Melmore has shown that he worked from Treasurer's House, near York Minster. By recreating his observations, the two students were able to conclude that he had observed from the Eastern-most window of the second floor, looking south towards the Minster.

Goodricke College at the University of York is named after Goodricke. 
There is also a modern sculpture named Algol in the grounds.

Goodricke is  discussed as one of the strange astronomer stories along with people like Carl Sagan dying of a blood disease, Hale interacting with elves (according to Notre Dame Physics Staff Person article on the internet and some databases, Kris Kriscianas' work), and Shoemaker getting in a car accident. Articles will sometimes mention a relationship between Goodricke's pneumonia and his observation of certain objects. The question of association between observation and pathology is certainly an interesting one.

Micha   liwi ski (born 5 February 1970 in Dobrotvir, Ukraine) is a Polish flatwater canoer won six world championship titles over his long career.

An ethnic Pole from Ukraine,  liwi ski represented the USSR at the 1988 Olympics, winning the Canadian canoe C-1 500m silver medal at the age of only eighteen.

Over the next three years he dominated the event, winning consecutive world championship gold medals in 1989, 1990 and 1991. However in the 1992 Olympics he had to settle for another silver medal behind Nikolay Bukhalov of Bulgaria.

The break-up of the Soviet Union affected  liwi ski's career greatly as the newly-independent Ukraine did not win any world championship gold medals during the 1990's.  liwi ski, now specialising in the short sprint 200m races, was still regarded as a top competitor at international events but he endured a frustrating sequence of four world championship bronze medals. With no 200m races included in the Olympics he competed in the C-1 500m at Atlanta 1996, finishing just outside the medals in fourth place.

In 2001 he accepted an invitation to switch to representing Poland, a decision which dramatically revived his career. Although in his thirties he went on to win three more world titles. With partner Marcin Kobierski he became C-2 1000m champion in 2001 in Pozna , Poland. In 2002 they retained their crown in Seville. 

 liwi ski's build-up to the Athens Olympics was beset with problems, not of his own making. In 2003 his partner Kobierski tested positive in a drugs test as did his most obvious left-handed replacement Micha  Gajownik. Both were given two-year bans, ruling them out of the Olympics. 

After much debate young hopeful Lukasz Woszczynski was chosen to partner  liwi ski. At their first major competition together they finished in fourth place at the 2003 World Championships in Gainesville, USA. In 2004 they became C-2 1000m European champions in front of their home crowd in Pozna . At the Athens Olympics they finished seventh in the C-2 1000m final, the exhausted Woszczynski collapsing at the end of the race.

The partnership was retained for the 2005 season. They took the C-2 500m silver medal at the European championships in July but Woszczynski was then injured and unable to take part in the World Championships in Zagreb. It seemed as if  liwi ski would be left without a boat. However, when a member of Poland's four-man (C4) 100m crew, Arkadiusz Tonski, also had to pull out injured,  liwi ski was called up as a last-minute replacement. The Polish four, ironically including the now rehabitated Gajownik, edged out the Romanian crew to take the gold medal. For the thirty-five year-old  liwi ski it was the first C-4 gold of his long career. 

 liwi ski is a member of the Spojnia Warsaw club. He is 177 cm (5'10") tall and weighs 89 kg (196 lbs).

"Deeper and Deeper" was the second single released from Madonna's 1992 album Erotica.

Song information.

 



The song was probably the album's strongest dance number and it came as little surprise when it was released as the second single from Erotica in late 1992; the song went top ten on both sides of the Atlantic (not to mention topping the Billboard dance charts). In the United Kingdom, a tabloid backlash began which would last for most of 1993 and the song ended a five year run of top five hits. Many fans have argued that had Madonna changed her overtly sexual image and released "Deeper and Deeper" as the lead-off single from the album, the whole Erotica project may have seen more commercial success. The song itself enjoyed much popularity at the time of release and has since become a fan favorite.

The song has been remixed by Shep Pettibone who both co-wrote and produced the track and also by David Morales. Some of their remixes feature use of the pitch shift. In Pettibone's "Classic 12" version, when Madonna sings "pretend", the "tend", which echoes at the same pitch in the original, is lowered quite a few octaves, raised to normal for a few seconds, and is raised to an almost child-like pitch for about 3 or 4 seconds before going to the final line. In Morales' club mix, after she sings, "never gonna hide it again", the pitch in "deep" is alternated between the original and a slightly lowered version for nearly 32 seconds. In the dub version ("David's Love Dub"), Madonna's heavily-phased "deeper and deeper" is at normal pitch for the first 15 seconds of the song, then gets lowered an octave until the bass starts a few seconds later, however, you can barely understand her, because the loop's phasedness distorts her words quite a lot.

The song was "Re-Invented" on her Re-Invention Tour. The song was a slow cut jazz version with trumpets playing. It was one of the fan favorites on the tour.

 Video .

Madonna's video for "Deeper and Deeper" is an ode to Andy Warhol, shot in near identical style to many of his films. In the video Madonna plays Edie Sedgwick. At the time of its release few understood the homage of the video, and it remains one of Madonna's most alluring videos (she did not include it in her recent video compilation (1993:1999).

Madonna's good friend and actress Debi Mazar makes a cameo in the video.

Wait and Bleed is a single by the band Slipknot on their second album Slipknot (self titled).

This song was recorded before James Root joined Slipknot.

A rumored meaning is that it is about a man who is dreaming that he is in a bath tub with his wrists cut, but soon wakes up and finds out that he's not actually dreaming. But instead of getting help, he just "waits and bleeds". However, this has not been verified by Slipknot nor is there any evidence in the song that it is about a suicide. Slipknot have commented in an interview  that their songs are general and meant for the listener to gather his/her own meaning from them.

This is one of the few pre-"Subliminal Verses" Slipknot songs with little or no swearing. The only "swear" word is in the lyric, "How the hell did I get here/Something about this so very wrong"

The song was ranked #36 on VH1's Top 40 Metal Songs. .

There are several different versions of this song:

Wait and Bleed which can be found in "Slipknot" album.
Wait and Bleed  from Slipknot's "Spit It Out";
Wait and Bleed Live in London ;
Wait and Bleed Live from the Slipknot 9.0 Live Album;

Wait & Bleed (Corey & Anders) - Unreleased-;
Wait & Bleed Live from Slipknot's Disasterpieces DVD;
Wait & Bleed rare animated music video from Disasterpieces DVD;

The video versions replace the screamed verses with alternative metal like sung verses, except for the last part of the song which is left unaltered. The word "hell" isn't censored from any versions of the song.

<doc id="2105962" title="Fort Bend Independent School District" nonfiltered="297" processed="296" dbindex="450299">
The Fort Bend Independent School District, also Fort Bend ISD or FBISD, is a school district system in the U.S. state of Texas based in the city of Sugar Land.

The district spans 174 square miles covering almost all of the city of Sugar Land, the city of Meadows Place, the Fort Bend county portion of Missouri City, Arcola, small sections of Houston, small sections of Pearland (including some of Shadow Creek Ranch), the unincorporated communities of Clodine, DeWalt, Mission Bend, and Fresno, and the Fort Bend county portion of the community of Rosharon. Fort Bend ISD is the ninth largest public school system in the state of Texas and third largest within the Houston Sugar Land Baytown Metropolitan Area.

Fort Bend Independent School District was created by the consolidation of the Sugar Land ISD and Missouri City ISD in 1959. Fort Bend ISD has ten high schools, the newest being Travis High School. eleven middle schools, and thirty-seven elementary schools. The school district also has the Technical Education Center, the M. R. Wood Alternative Education Center, and the Progressive High School to serve a variety of vocational interests as well as special learning needs. 

Fort Bend ISD is the largest employer in Fort Bend County with more than 7,800 district employees.

A portion of Stafford was formerly a part of Fort Bend ISD, but it broke away and formed the Stafford Municipal School District. Residents in Stafford's ETJ, however, are served by Fort Bend ISD, not Stafford MSD.

All houses or residential areas in Fort Bend ISD are assigned to an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school.

History.
Fort Bend ISD was formed when Sugar Land ISD and Missouri City ISD merged after an election on April 18, 1959.

Recognitions.
Seventy percent of the district s campuses received an Exemplary or Recognized rating from the Texas Education Agency in 2002. That same year, the district was named a Recognized District by the Texas Education Agency for the second consecutive year, making it one of the largest public school districts in Texas to receive that rating. 

Austin High School and Clements High School, both in Sugar Land, have been recognized by Texas Monthly magazine in its list of the top 10 high schools in the state of Texas. In addition, Clements, Austin, and Elkins high schools ranked 313th, 626th, and 702nd, respectively, among the top 1000 schools in the United States by Newsweek.

Fort Bend ISD has been named one of the top 100 School Districts in the Nation for a Fine Arts Education, according to a nation-wide survey of public and private school programs.

 Gifted and Talented Mentorship Program .
The GT Mentorship Program is part of the district's Gifted and Talented curriculum.  This course is one honors credit in social studies as an advanced studies course.  Students participate in a semester long seminar course followed by a semester long field experience working one-on-one with a mentor in the student's chosen field.  During the fall semester, students gain self-directed learning by conducting in-depth research on a topic that has particular interest to them as well as going on informational interviews in the community, developing a resume, and improving their professional skills.  In this course idea production, not replication is stressed.  Students must be prolific with original ideas, especially with regard to their final projects.

The Mentorship Program is offered to juniors and seniors in FBISD high schools who have been identified as gifted and talented.  Students must complete an application process during their sophomore or junior year to be considered for the program the following school year.  Student applications are screened by a selection committee to determine which students will be invited for an individual interview.  Class size is limited to a maximum of 15 students and is highly selective.  The Mentorship Program offers academic challenge and requires a high level of student responsibility.  The students selected are outstanding in their high school classes academically as well as in extracurricular activities.  The rigorous curriculum and demands of this course require students to be focused, goal-oriented, self-motivated, mature, determined to pursue enriched learning, and passionate about a particular field or topic.

The City of Rockford Pipe Band (USA) was founded in January of 2000 and made its performance debut on Saint Patrick's Day just three months later.        

Since that first appearance the band has been active in Highland Games competitions, stage performances, parades, memorials, festivals, charitable events and fund raisers, as well as providing pipers for weddings, funerals and special occasions.

The band is affiliated with competitive Highland Dancers (Highland Dance) and often appears combining Highland Music and Dance. 

In 2003, the City of Rockford Pipe Band earned the title of MWPBA Champion Supreme Pipe Band (Grade 5) by placing 1st in both the Midwest (Springfield, Illinois) and Regional (Oberlin, Ohio) Championships. In 2006 the band captured the MWPBA Champion Supreme designation (Grade 4) and received its 5th consecutive Rockford Area Music Industry Award (RAMI) in the World Music category, and is slated for induction into
the "RAMI Hall of Fame" in 2007.

Members hail from Rockford, Illinois and the surrounding area, the majority of which are graduates of the City of Rockford Pipe Band School of Piping and Drumming through Rock Valley College.

Choroideremia is an X-linked recessive retinal degenerative disease that leads to the degeneration of the choriocapillaris, the retinal pigment epithelium, and the photoreceptor of the eye.  Choroideremia is caused by the deletion of the Rab escort protein 1 (REP1). Rab escort protein 2 (REP2) is 75% identical and can almost compensate for the loss of REP1. The REPs are essential for the prenylation of Rab proteins. Studies have shown that there is a build up of unprenylated Rab27 in lymphoblasts from Choroideremia patients.

Generally, only men show symptoms of this disease, although in rare cases some women also acquire it.  Initially a person suffering from choroideremia has night blindness, which begins in youth.  As the disease progresses, a CHM sufferer loses their peripheral vision and depth perception, eventually losing all sight by middle age.  In some cases, a severe loss of acuity and color perception become evident as the disease progresses.

The link between the loss of REP1 and the build up of unprenylated Rab27 and the degeneration of the eye is unknown as yet.  

At this time, there is no treatment or cure for this disease.

For other uses, see Beef Wellington (disambiguation).;

Beef tenderloin, or eye fillet (New Zealand and Australia), is cut from the middle of a cow. As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the Psoas major muscle along the central spine portion, which more or less hangs between the shoulder blade and hip socket. This muscle tissue does very little work, so it is the most tender part of the cow. The tenderloin can either be cut for roasts or for steaks.

When left whole, the tenderloin is known as a filet or a "Chateaubriand". When sliced, it forms various steaks. Those toward the loin end of the piece, when cut into slices one to two inches thick, are known as filets. Sometimes, the cuts are called filet mignon, while at other times filet mignon refers to a dish made with a beef tenderloin filet, not the cut itself. Other portions of the tenderloin, when cut into steaks, are typically called tenderloin steaks, not filets.

Since it is the least stringy part of the animal, most beef dishes requiring high quality meat, such as steak tartare, are ideally made from the tenderloin.

Beef Wellington.
Beef Wellington  filet of beef tenderloin coated with pâté de foie gras and a duxelles of mushrooms that are then all wrapped in puff pastry.  Beef Wellington is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Some people suggest this was due to his love of a dish of beef, truffles, mushrooms, Madeira wine, and pâté cooked in pastry, but there is no evidence to say for sure whether it was any more than a patriotic gesture by an unconnected chef. Sometimes, "wellington" can also denote any meat dish that is prepared similarly, the most common variations being Sausage Wellington and Salmon Wellington.

Barotropic cyclones are those where isotherms are parallel to height lines on a map at a constant pressure surface, or at the surface, parallel to isobars.  Tropical cyclones and cutoff cyclones (occluded and formerly occluded cyclones) both qualify as barotropic, though due to differences in their vertical wind structure and temperature profiles, cutoffs are referred to as "barotropically cold" and tropical cyclones are call "barotropically warm".

Assuming two-state protein folding, denaturation midpoint is defined as that temperature (Tm) or denaturant concentration (Cm) at which both the folded and unfolded states are equally populated. 

If the widths of the folded and unfolded wells are assumed to be equal both these states will have identical free energies at the midpoint. However, for natural proteins this is not the case. There is an inherent asymmetry as evidenced by the difference in heat capacities between them - the folded ensemble has a lower heat capacity (in other words, lower fluctuations thus indicating a narrower well) than the unfolded ensemble. This would mean that the free energy of the folded state is lower at the denaturation midpoint than the unfolded state. In such a scenario, the temperature at which both the wells have identical free energies is termed the characteristic temperature (To).

Revolution is a steel roller coaster made by Schwarzkopf of Germany.  The coaster is located in the Baja Ridge area of Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California.
Many coaster enthusiasts believe that the Revolution is the first roller coaster to include an inversion, but this is not the case; coasters with inversions were created before 1900, and Knott's Berry Farm's Corkscrew (opened in 1975) was the first steel roller coaster to include inversions, featuring two corkscrew inversions.  Revolution is the first steel roller coaster to include a vertical loop inversion.
During the construction of Six Flags Magic Mountain's roller coaster Tatsu in 2005, parts of Revolution had to be dismantled to make way for the new ride; it has since reopened.The Revolution was prominently featured in the climax of the 1977 suspense thriller Rollercoaster.

It later featured in the film National Lampoon's Vacation. Dubbed the  Whipper Snapper,  the Griswold family and kidnapped security guard Russ Lasky (John Candy) rode this coaster in the final scenes of the film.

Individually the Islands are known by their Gaelic names. From the largest to the smallest they are Eilean Mór (Large Island), Eilean Fraoich (Heather Island) and Eilean Buidhe (Yellow Island).

Oddly only the smallest of these tiny islets, Eilean Buidhe, shows any sign of ever having been permanently inhabited having the remains of a vitrified fort on it.  Eilean Mór, huge in comparison supports only a little stunted woodland at its northern end.

All water going traffic that travels through the kyles has to negotiate the narrow sound that separates Eilean Buidhe from Eilean Mór and Eilean Fraoich.  These narrows are marked on either side by several light beacons.

<doc id="7458857" title="List of fighting styles in Fist of the North Star" nonfiltered="312" processed="311" dbindex="450314">




The following is a list of fictional fighting styles in Fist of the North Star.


Hokuto Shinken (North Star God Fist).

The 1800-year-old Chinese martial arts style used by Kenshiro and his brothers, Hokuto Shinken attacks the human body from within accomplished by striking or grasping various areas and driving one's energy inside. This will usually result in almost instant death, cause the opponent to become crippled, or occasionally rob the victim of their own physical control. The technique also increases the practitioner's strength tremendously, and can allow them to perform miraculous feats of healing. 

Unlike Nanto Seiken, it can only have one successor at a given time. Usually, it is passed down from father to son or some other blood relative; it was passed on to Ramon Kasumi (aka Ryuken) after Kenshiro Kasumi was presumably killed (see Fist of the Blue Sky). Anyone else schooled in Hokuto Shinken not selected as successor must vow to give up the art or be forced to either have their fists destroyed or their memory removed.

Ryuken had a series of students who grew up as if they were brothers. The ones shown in the manga are Kenshiro, Jagi, Toki, Raoh, and Kim. Kim was eliminated from the rite of succession early on and was kicked out of the dojo. Toki was eliminated much later due to his nuclear accident which brought on a terminal illness. Jagi was presumably eliminated due to his underhandedness and clear lack of ability compared to his other brothers. Finally, Raoh and Kenshiro were put to a test where they were both confronted by a wild tiger and had to prove their merit as an assassin. Kenshiro was able to cause the tiger to submit quietly to death whereas Raoh caused the tiger to fear death and attack him. Kenshiro was seen as having a true assassin's style and was therefore chosen as the 64th successor to Hokuto Shinken. Raoh told Ryuken that he was making a mistake. Ryuken told Ken that the tiger submiting quietly to death showed that even if Raoh is the strongest, Ken's style is truly the fearsome/terrible one.

After Ken was chosen Jagi was outraged and tried to rally his brothers to kill Ken so Raoh could be successor, however Toki supported Ken, and Raoh did not care because he refused to give up the Hokuto style anyway. He believed since he was the strongest that he did not need to be named successor to conquer the world. Jagi decided to attack Ken alone but was defeated easily by Ken. When Jagi lunged to attack Ken he "slipped" and Ken took advantage of it to beat Jagi. Jagi made excuses saying that if he had not slipped he could have beat Ken, but it was later revealed that Jagi did not slip, but that Ken was so fast that he struck Jagi's pressure points before Jagi even knew what happened. To stop himself from dying from Ken's attacks, Jagi used his Hokuto skills to hit his own pressure points to stop his head from exploding, but it was not enough to stop permanent damage from occurring. Jagi remained scarred and had to wear braces on his head thereafter.

The four primary contenders for the Hokuto Shinken style all had at least a basic level of mastery of this martial arts form. The anime series states that Hokuto Shinken is an ancient art of 2000 years and cannot be mastered by anyone without the utmost spirit and determination. Even Jagi, the least skilled of all the brothers, has a fighting prowess that can put non-users to shame. Toki (not present in the animated movie) was firmly embedded in the healing aspects of the powerpoints of Hokuto Shinken even before the nuclear war. Kenshiro's kind but strict nature made him the best choice to carry on the Hokuto Shinken style. Raoh's unforgiving, selfish, and brutally violent nature cost him the chance to succeed as the 64th successor. 

After Kenshiro defeats his one time friend, Shin, Kenshiro is made aware that someone has committed horrible atrocities in his name. This person turned out to be Jagi, and starts off the second season of the series with Kenshiro's quest to make contact with all of his brothers. As the story moves along the audience gets a better picture of what Kenshiro went through in his quest to be the heir to the Fist of the North star.

Toki is highly respected by Kenshiro, not only for his martial arts mastery, but for his kind demeanor. Toki is characterized by his long white hair, small headband, and kind face. A liberal interpretation of his appearance and actions can be made to say that he is a Christ like figure. Toki tells a story from before the war when Ken, Shin, Raoh, and even himeslf all had feelings for Yuria. Shin and Raoh both only thought of themselves and viewed Yuria as a trophy to be won. Toki, however, defended Yuria against one of Raoh's unwanted advances on one occasion before the nuclear war. Kenshiro recalls that Toki was once so skilled in Hokuto Shinken that he would have probably become the next successor if it were not for the radiation sickness that he received when he sacrificed himself to save Kenshiro and Yuria.

Toki and Raoh are natural brothers, and are adopted by Ryuken after the death of their parents (later in the manga,
this was retconned into the two coming from Shura Island with Kenshiro). Ryuken was originally unwilling to adopt both children, and cast them from a cliff, telling them that the child who made it back up would be his successor. To his surprise, Raoh scaled the cliff with one arm, carrying Toki with the other. Ryuken then adopted both children and began to instruct Raoh in Hokuto Shinken. Years later, after watching Toki beat up a bully many times his size, Ryuken realized that a martial arts genius was hiding in the younger brother as well and allowed Toki to come into the dojo with Raoh. This was the beginning of their tragedy, because they both knew that they would be fated to battle for the succession. Toki had once promised Raoh that if Raoh were to turn to evil, Toki would stop him. Although Toki tried to honor this promise, he was devastated by his illness and unable to stop Raoh. Raoh then freed Toki from his obligation and told him to battle his illness instead.

Raoh is a large and massive man that towers even over the large frame of Kenshiro. Raoh has a square expressionless face and almost always wears a large helmet and rides a massive black horse. Raoh's single minded ambition and determination fuel his black heart with a lust for power. Even though Raoh loses the contest for successor, he none-the-less continues to use Hokuto Shinken for his own purposes. While it is obvious in both the series and the movie that other characters (Shin, Rei, Jagi, Toki, etc) all possess enough skill to dominate the violent masses, only Ken and Raoh seem to defeat other notable fighters with relative ease. Raoh is such a powerful fighter that the movie ends anti-climatically when Raoh actually defeats Kenshiro in a one-on-one fight of the film's original theatrical release. The aforementioned scenario did not occur in the manga nor the Japanese home video release. Only after this confrontation does Raoh seem to understand the words that Ryuken mentioned to him so long ago, "Power without perception means nothing."

The second half of the series continues with Kenshiro's quest of defeating Raoh's remaining army and building his strength to defeat and end Raoh's terror. During this part we learn more about Raoh's past and story as a sympathetic character.  At volume 13, it turns out that Yuria never died from her suicide attempt and she is also a Nanto Seiken successor as the "Motherly Star" (hence Ryuken once foretold that the world will be in peace when Hokuto and Nanto join forces). When Raoh knew Yuria was alive he took her as a hostage and forced Kenshiro into life-and-death combat once and for all.

Nanto Seiken (South Star Holy Fist).
Nanto Rokusei Ken (South Star Six Holy Fists).
The Nanto Seiken style sets generally tend to consist of styles that focus on dazzling maneuvers and using energy to pierce, cut, and dice enemies and objects. Often, they focus on speed, to slice the opponent, and let them fall apart afterwards. Sometimes this will happen so fast, the opponent will not even realize they're dead. It can be debated that, in the manga, air pressure may be used to slice the opponent instead of energy.
 Nanto Kosh  Ken.
Nanto Kosh  Ken (South Star Lone Eagle fist) is a very direct style of Nanto Seiken. It focuses on stabbing and thrusting attacks, seemingly being most useful at a close range. Often, the slicing will be simulated via tearing, where the user will put his hand into an opponent's body, usually torso, and pull it to either side.

It is important to note than in the original manga and anime, this style was simply referred as "Nanto Seiken" when it was used, as Shin was the first Nanto fighter (as well as the first major antagonist) introduced in the series.

 Nanto Suich  Ken.
Nanto Suich  Ken (South Star Waterfowl fist) is the most graceful of the Nanto Seiken styles. With a focus on grace and aerial attacks, its primary usage is for medium-range attacks.

 Nanto K kaku Ken.
Nanto K kaku Ken (South Star Crimson Crane fist) is a style based on long-range, vertical attacks. It can attack a wide vertical range, and seems to cause more damage when used for vertical slices.

 Nanto Hakur  Ken.
Nanto Hakur  Ken (South Star White Heron fist) is a kick-based style, somewhat rare in Hokuto no Ken. Whereas most Nanto Seiken styles primarily use the hands, Nanto Hakur  Ken primarily uses the feet (though it still uses the hands). The user can attack a wide range around them, even a spinning kick that decimates those around them.

 Nanto H -  Ken.
Nanto H -  Ken (South Star Phoenix Fist) is the most powerful form of Nanto Seiken. It is a free-form style, without stances or forced routine. The user has the ability to glide forward, leading into a powerful scissor attack. There can absolutely be only one successor to this style; the successor must kill his teacher. The ultimate technique of this style is Tensh  J ji H , the Heaven-soaring cross phoenix, which takes a stance with the user's arms held out evenly, like a cross. As the name suggests, it's launched into a powerful aerial attack. This is the only stance taken in Nanto H -  Ken, and is only taken when a worthy opponent appears.

Nanto Goshasei (South Star Five Chariots).
The Nanto Goshasei styles revolve around the use of elements, but still share much in common with the normal Nanto Seiken. Read: Its ability to slice the opponents. However, all forms of this use different techniques and attack styles to do so.

 Wind.
The Gosha Wind style is a style based on swift maneuvers, aerial attacks, and apparently long-range attacks, though it has been seen used as a "Shield" of sorts. This style uses air pressure and cutting winds to slice the opponent to pieces. Due to this usage of wind, it can be used as a long or short range style.

 Fire.
The Gosha Fire style seems to use linear lines of heat to cut through the opponents (basically burning through them). If the opponent has been damaged, due to the large amount of heat, he will burst into flames. The user, if willing to sacrifice himself, can well up the heat in his own body, causing spontaneous combustion.

 Mountain.
The Gosha Mountain style seems to be based on crushing force, pressure tearing the opponent down the middle. Unlike most other Nanto styles, it is not graceful in the least. It is blunt and powerful. As opposed to the fine, linear slices of the other Nanto styles, the attack size of this style is rather large. To further clarify, if an opponent is sliced down the middle of his body, the pressure will crush through the opponent, effectively removing the middle third of the body.

 Cloud.
The Cloud style is a free-form style, apparently without set stances. As opposed to cutting, the cloud style seems to be based on defeating the opponent in a series of long, quick, smooth motions. 

 Ocean .
The Ocean style doesn't see much use in the anime series. Noticeably, the user seems to be able to increase his body size, curl into a ball, and send himself flying through the air, destroying whatever is in his path.

Minor Nanto styles.
Most of these are barely even worth mentioning. Most of them were seen only in the anime series, as well. Filler was needed in the anime, to lengthen the story, especially during the first chapter. According to the anime, Shin taught his generals some Nanto powers, who used their limited Nanto Knowledge to make their own styles.
Nanto Muon Ken (Silent Fist);
Seems to be mainly for use with claws, needles, and stabbing weapons. Apparently just improves the speed and cutting quality of attacks.
Nanto S zan Ken (Paired Kill Fist);
A strange knife-throwing style, that requires two users, facing each other, with the opponent in the middle. They throw the knives between each other, around the opponent. One user throws underhand and catches overhand, the other used throws overhand and catches underhand. They slowly move in, barely noticeable, until they are close enough to attack with the knives.
Nanto S y  Ken (Paired Hawk Fist);
Mentioned, but not used. All that's known is that it requires two users.
Nanto Sh ten Ken (Ascension Fist);
A style based on speed, agility, and height. The user can jump extraordinarily high, throw objects with stunning accuracy and speed, and produce two mirage duplicates around him, with which he can rotate for an illusion.
Nanto K mori Ken (Bat Fist);
Involves the usage of gliders and claws. Mainly involves diving down onto the opponent.
Nanto Bakusatsu Ken (Explosive Kill Fist);
Creative, rough fist to fist art that uses explosives and jumping techniques.
Nanto Ansh  Ken (Dark Bell Fist);
A style based on use of sound waves and hypnosis. The style's sound waves tend to come from bells.
Nanto Ry jin Ken (Dragon King Fist);
A set of styles. The first one is fire boxing, in which the user can safely engulf his skin in flames to destroy his opponent. Also in this style, the user can breathe fire. However, if the user is incapable of breathing, the fire can not escape, and the fire will destroy them from the inside out.
The second part of this style is an illusion-based style, which also uses knife-throwing. The user apparently could use small crystal orbs to give the illusion of a dragon, which would be hiding knives or flames.
Nanto Ningen H dan (Human Cannonball);
Closer to a move than a style. It involves the user being equipped with a sword (apparently katana) and fired into the air via cannon. The user, upon getting above his target, can hold their sword outwards and drop down suddenly and with great, violent force. This is more of a siege style than a fight style.

Taizan-ji Kenp  (Mount Tai Temple Martial Arts).
An ancient fighting style developed at the Taishan Temple in Shanxi, China. The Taizan fighters grew corrupt and eventually carried much influence over the Japanese government in the 1980s before the nuclear war (This may not be in continuity; it directly refers to the two Hokuto no Ken tryouts, in which the Taizan fighters were the main enemies. When the series proper began, most of the backstory was drastically retooled). In the 1990s, many of the Taizan fighters became part of Raoh's army.
Taizan Tenr  Ken (Taishan Sirius Fist) - A freezing, flesh-scooping style.
Taizan Ry  S j  Ben (Taishan Style Twin Streak Whip) - A whip-wielding style.
Taizan Y  Ken (Taishan Bewitch Fist) - Uses ribbons and spikes;

Kazan Saigoku Ken (Mount Hua Western Peak Fist).
A few characters used martial arts related to Mount Hua, most notably the entire Kiba clan. Bask also used this style, as did a spearman on the Land of Asura. There is no official name given for the main branch of this martial art.
Kazan Kakuteigi (Huashan Horn Resisting Sport) - An old sumo skin-hardening technique;
Daraidai (Thunder Strike Pedestal);
Kazan K gai Koh  (Huashan Steel Armor Technique);
Kazan Kakutei Harite (Huashan Horn Resisting Slap);
Kazan Gunr  Ken (Huashan Wolf-Pack Fist);
Sh kei Ken (Hieroglyph Fist);
Y metsu no Kata (Ominous Destructive Form);
Kazan Bunretsu Ken (Huashan Split Fist);
Kazan Gokuaku S  (Huashan Hell Grasp Claw);
Saigoku-Ha Gins  (Western Peak Sect Silver Spear);

Gento K  Ken (Original Dipper Imperial Fist).
The Gento K  Ken style was created to protect the "Tentei" (Heaven Empress). Their symbol is the Tentei star, also known as the Taikyoku-sei (Polaris). The Gento K  Ken style focuses on use of ki energy, usually projected outwards as a blast, or sometimes a shield. It uses ki like a blade, to destroy the opponent's body on a cellular level. This style gets surprisingly little use in the series, save for Falco of the golden style. This style is based on and ranked by colors. It is unclear what, if any, constellation that "Gento" refers to.  Many fans speculate it is the Little Dipper because it's a dipper-shaped constellation that contains Polaris.

The colors are:
Gold;
The Gold style is the absolute strongest, generally used for varying types of blasts and projectiles. Noticeably, it can also freeze and cut opponents.
Purple;
The Purple style seems to be based around rings of energy, theorizing that they're unavoidable.
Red;
The Red style gets absolutely no use in the series. One attack is seen in the anime, and it seems fairly generic.
Blue;
Anime-only style.  The Blue style seems fairly generic as well. Notably, the sole user of it uses a spear, but it's unknown if this is universal or just a personal preference. (The Blue and Green styles were created for the anime to take the place of Jakou's sons)
Green;
Anime-only style. The Green style never sees any use in the series.

Hokuto Ryuu Ken (North Star Lapis Lazuli Fist).
Derived alongside Hokuto Shinken from the original Hokuto Souke ruling family of Shura Island. Its first practitioner was Ryuoh. Practitioners of Hokuto Shinken regard its existence as heresy. While it shares many of its basic attacks with Hokuto Shinken, its essence is deeply rooted in channeling of essence and magic. The effort required to control these energies drives many of its practitioners mad with hatred. The last master of the art, Juukei murdered his own family and attempted to kill Ryuken, who was able to restore him to sanity. Later, Juukei sent Kenshiro, Raoh, and Toki to Ryuken, believing that Raoh would succeed Ryuuken as the Hokuto Shinken successor and free his motherland of Shura from the evil of Hokuto Ryuu Ken. Later, unable to wait for Raoh, he trained Kaioh (Raoh's older brother), Han, and Hyoh (Kenshiro's natural brother) in Hokuto Ryuuken. To his dismay, rather than fight against the evil of Shura, they joined in it. He later joined a resistance movement against the Shura, reluctantly teaching Shachi Hokuto Ryuu Ken to help him fight against the Shura soldiers.

When Kenshiro followed Lin, Juukei was distraught that it was not Raoh who had succeeded Ryuuken in Hokuto Shin Ken. After Han was killed, Juukei, believing that Kenshiro could not raise his hand against his own brother, sought out Hyoh in combat. He had erased Hyoh's memories of Kenshiro years before so he could focus on the fight. Attempting to undo this erasure, he discovered that Kaioh had modified his memories and was slain by Hyoh. Although Hyoh was eventually able to regain his memory, he was defeated by Kaioh, unable to stop Kaioh's fall to evil. Kaioh later became himself again and destroyed himself with molten lava after being defeated by Kenshiro, bringing Hokuto Ryuu Ken to its end.

Towards the end of the manga, the true relationship between Hokuto Shinken and Hokuto Ryuuken is brought to light. The Hokuto Souke, practitioners of Hokuto Ryuuken, ruled Shura Island during the time of the Gento Empire's fall several thousand years ago. To ensure that they could bring peace in the violent times, the rulers of the family decided that next son of the line would be their successor and invent the world's deadliest fist. The two princesses of the Hokuto line gave birth on the same day to two sons, Shuken and Ryuuoh. To prevent division among the family, it was decided that one of the infants would die. Ohka, the eldest of the sisters, gave her life to protect both children, when she discovered that her sister Shume was ill and would not survive to see her son grow up. Shume's son Shuken never forgot the love his mothers showed him. Becoming the successor, he developed Hokuto Shinken. Ryuuoh threw away love, and mastered the family art of Hokuto Ryuuken.  Kenshiro and Hyoh are descended from Shuken; Kaio, Raoh, Toki, and Sayaka are descended from Ryuuoh. 

Due to his lineage, Hyoh had knowledge of the 'original' Hokuto (the precursor to Ryuuoh's refined Hokuto Ryuuken). He refused to use this style, believing that it was for Kenshiro only. He is later able to pass on this knowledge to Ken, and Kenshiro discovers the truth behind the two styles: Hokuto Ryuuken is ultimately a passive style based on distorting the enemy with 'evil' ki, and it cannot stand against Hokuto Shinken, which was designed to be used in an active role. Ultimately, however, the deciding factor between Kenshiro and Kaio is Kenshiro's compassion. Kaio, thinking only of himself, does not understand death and cannot carry the spirits of others on inside him the way Kenshiro can. driving him to fight. Thus, the differences between the two reflect the differences between their ancestors.

Hokumon no Ken (Fist of the North Gate).
An inferior offshoot of Hokuto Shin Ken started by a former Hokuto Shin Ken student that failed to be successor. Seiji from Shin Hokuto No Ken (New Fist of the North Star) used this style. Unlike its origin art, Hokumon no Ken is designed for healing, not for the purpose of assassination. This became even more apparent when Seiji's techniques failed to have any effect on Kenshiro. However, it is still very effective in killing those who are not trained in Hokuto no Ken or other arts.

The Siege of Jerusalem (1769) is a poetical drama, full of high drama and unrequited love, written by Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, an  ancestor of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. 

Mary Eleanor Bowes, the daughter of George Bowes of Streatlam and Gibside, married John Bowes, 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. The Earl, who suffered from tuberculosis, often was away from home seeking a cure. The bored Countess began writing The Siege of Jerusalem "to amuse herself", in the words of one of her biographers. After its publication in 1769, the Countess turned to extramarital affairs for amusement. 

On March 7, 1776, Lord Strathmore died of tuberculosis. The Countess subsequently married the Irish rakehell and fortunehunter Andrew Robinson Stoney, and their tempestuous liaison and divorce became a major scandal in Georgian Britain. The story of Stoney Bowes and the Countess of Strathmore was fictionalized by William Makepeace Thackeray in The Luck of Barry Lyndon.

Influences.
There is another poem entitled The Siege of Jersualem in the English language, an anonymous Middle English work. This earlier Siege of Jersualem is an epic poem written in the second half of the 14th century (possibly ca. 1370-1380). It is uncertain whether this piece influenced Bowes' own work, though its gore and extreme anti-semitism differeniate it from her more romantic work.

<doc id="1638712" title="Ukrainian stone stela" nonfiltered="314" processed="313" dbindex="450316">

The anthropomorphic stone stelae found in the Ukrainian steppe, with some finds extending the area to Moldavia, the northern Caucasus (Southern Federal District) and the area north of the Caspian Sea (western Kazakhstan), date from the Copper Age (ca. 4000 BC 2000 BC), through the Cimmerian period and   Scythian and Sarmatian times to the early Slavs of the 1st millennium CE. They were first described by Erik Lasote, ambassador to emperor Rudolf, in 1594, who recorded
"seven beacons, images cut from stone, and they numbered more than twenty and were standing atop the kurgans or barrows".

Copper Age and Bronze Age.

The earliest of these stelae date to the 4th millennium BC, and are associated with the early Bronze Age Yamna and Kemi-Oba cultures (see Kurgan). They number in the hundreds, most of them very crude stone slabs with a simple schematic protruding head and a few features such as eyes or breasts carved into the stone. Some twenty specimens are more complex, featuring ornaments, weapons, human or animal figures etc.

Cimmerians.
The Cimmerians of the early 1st millennium BC left a small number (about ten are known) of distinctive stone stelae. Another four or five "deer stelae" dating to the same time are known from the northern Caucasus.

Scythians and Sarmatians.
From the 7th century BC, Scythian tribes began to dominate the Pontic steppe. They were in turn displaced by the Sarmatians from the 2nd century BC, except for in the Crimea, where they persisted for a few centuries longer. These peoples left carefully crafted stone stelae, with all features cut in deep relief.

Early Slavs.
Stelae of early Slavic deities are again more primitive. There are some thirty sites of the middle Dniestr region where such anthropomorphic idols were found. The most famous of these is the "Zbruch idol"  (ca. 10th century), a post measuring about 3 meters, with four faces under a single pointed hat (c.f. Svetovid). Boris Rybakov argued for identification of the faces with the gods Perun, Makosh, Lado and Veles.

The Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, known as the EEPTU was a British trade union formed in 1968. It was a union for electricians. It often found itself in unpopular positions with the trade union movement as it chose to work harmoniously with employers rather than in defiance.

History.
The union started as the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) which was formed in 1889 and what became the Plumbing Trades Union which was formed in 1865. The ETU came from the merger of the Union of Electrical Operatives, formed 1868, and the Amalgamated Society of Telegraph and Telephone Construction Men. The PTU started out as the United Operative Plumbers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland, which became the United Operative Plumbers' and Domestic Engineers' Association of Great Britain and Ireland in 1911, then the Plumbers, Glaziers and Domestic Engineers' Union in 1931, before becoming the PTU in 1946. In June 1961, the ETU was taken to court for conspiracy to defraud by the undemocratic union leadership. Jock Byrne took over leadership which is when the right-wing ideology of the union gained ground.

Jock Byrne suffered a stroke, which led in 1966, Frank Chapple (August 8th 1921 - October 19th 2004) to become the leader. He espoused free-market thinking, which was unusual for a union leader, and aimed to rid his union of communists; his former union - the ETU had been run by communists. In some ways, he was a man ahead of his time: the era of New Labour. He was a reluctant loyalist to the Labour Party. This was just the beginning. The union went on to advocate nuclear power, privatisation of state-owned industries and membership of the European Union. It also co-operated in single union deals with companies - to the smooth the path of employers, and as a result benefitting their union, possibly (or deliberately) at the expense of other unions.

In July 1968, the ETU merged with the PTU to form the Electrical, Electronic & Telecommunications Union & Plumbing Trades Union, which became the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications & Plumbing Union in 1973. In the early 1970s, electricity was in steep demand, as there were many national power cuts caused by coal miners going on strike.

In September 1982, Frank Chapple became leader of the TUC. Eric Hammond became leader when Frank left in 1984. Frank Chapple became Lord Chapple of Hoxton in 1985. Eric Hammond was not liked by many unions as he tried to modernise working practices.

Wapping dispute.
The history of the EEPTU would not be complete without this notorious chapter. In this dispute in January 1986, Rupert Murdoch and the editor of the Sunday Times, Andrew Neil, had to find a strategy to implement new computer technology and printing equipment without the whole scheme being blocked by the trades unions of the printers - the National Graphical Association, led by Tony Dubbins, and SOGAT, led by Brenda Dean. Workers often had to belong to a closed shop to work in printing works, and there were many strikes. Working practices would have to be changed and huge redundancies would be unavoidable, as all the labourious printing and typeface setting found in Fleet Street could be simplified using more reliable and less-troublesome computers. This barely involved printers, certainly no-one was needed to produce the typefaces.

So an alternative to asking the NGA and SOGAT politely if they wanted to change on their terms was the only way to get the whole changeover completed. The unions were given no hint or consultation of how the whole long-winded process of printing was going to be unceremoniously ditched and effectively started from scratch. They were relying on stopping the National Union of Journalists members from using the computers. They were entirely duped.

It was a brave new world and not one that was lightly undertaken. An option could be to use printers who did not belong to a union, but the outcome chosen was to use workers who belonged to the EETPU - they were being classed as electricians. This was a loophole to avoid confrontation with the NGA and SOGAT, who were not the greatest advocates of change. It was known as a sweetheart deal. In November 1986, the TUC decided not to punish the EEPTU for this deal.

Expulsion from the TUC.
The union wrote its own rule book when it came to making deals with companies, and often stuck two fingers up at the TUC. It was expelled from the TUC for violating the Bridlington Agreement which stops unions from poaching members from other TUC unions.  The EETPU had developed a policy of signing single union agreements in companies where it had few members.  In 1987, the TUC asked the EETPU to retract from these agreements at Yuasa (a Japanese battery company), Thorn-EMI and Orion (a Japanese electronics company). The EETPU refused and its 225,000 workers were expelled, which was a relief and revenge for some more left-wing unions.

Once separate from the TUC, communist sections of the union re-emerged in an effort to change the policies of the union.

Mergers.
The union merged with the AEU to become the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) in May 1992, so the electricians were now part of the TUC. The AEEU was led by Ken Jackson, who belonged to the EETPU, and was knighted in 1999. The AEEU then merged with the Manufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF) to become Amicus in 2001. Amicus, the largest private sector union with 1.2m workers, has been led by Derek Simpson, a left-winger, since June 2002. Tony Dubbins, of the NGA in the Wapping dispute, became Joint Deputy General Secretary in 2004.

Animal Liberation Orchestra (ALO) is a musical group, currently signed on Jack Johnson's Brushfire Records label. They have released one full length album, Fly Between Falls, which is being re-released by Brushfire Records. They have also released several EPs and independent albums, including Time Expander.

 Biography .


Born from a friendship nurtured during their days at Saratoga High School, the band calling themselves Django consisted of Zach Gill (Keyboards/Vocals), Steve Adams (Bass Guitar/Vocals), Dan Lebowitz (Guitars/Percussion/Vocals) and Matt West (Drums/Vocals). 

Originally a nine-piece ensemble featuring a brass section, ALO began drawing enormous attention in the Santa Barbara area with their rousing stage shows. When Zach, Dan and Steve returned to their hometown Saratoga, they stripped back down to a quartet, playing with a wide variety of different drummers. Finally, in 2002, the trio reunited with drummer David Brogan (with whom they had previously played in college) and the current version of Animal Liberation Orchestra was solidified.

Zach Gill, the keyboard player, went to college with the popular singer-songwriter, Jack Johnson, and they had good connections with one another. Zach Gill has recently provided piano in Jack Johnson's band, adding a new flavor to the live performances.

Animal Liberation Orchestra have already released several independent albums, including Fly Between Falls, which was recently re-released on Brushfire Records. This album includes the re-release of the track, "Girl, I Wanna Lay You Down", which features Jack Johnson providing guitar and vocals. New to the re-release is the song "Walls of Jericho", a tour staple and crowd favorite noted by its festival imagery, wailing guitar solo, and euphoric crescendo. This track gained popularity after its live performance was featured in the Jack Johnson and Friends Live at the Greek DVD. The studio version's debut on myspace.com received mixed review.

Recently, ALO finished a tour supporting Jack Johnson, along with Matt Costa, all across Europe, including United Kingdom, France and Spain, with two dates in mid-April supporting Jack Johnson in Brazil.  In June, they opened for Dave Matthews Band at stops in upstate New York and North Carolina. On October 14th, they sold out their first headlining concert at the venerated Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. Dubbed "The Abnormal Formal," this show included supporting acts Mojow and the Vibration Army, Honeycut and Blue Turtle Seduction, and featured ALO playing with special guests including Brett Dennen and Jack Johnson. ALO performed on New Year's Eve at the Sea of Dreams event in San Francisco, then boarded a cruise ship to participate in the soldout Jam Cruise 5 from January 2-7, 2007. The band will also support Michael Franti & Spearhead at the Solutions for Dreamers benefit in Santa Barbara on February 24, and have booked a slot at the East Coast Blues & Roots Music Fest in Australia in April.

The Guns of the South (1992, ISBN 0-345-37675-7) is a novel by writer Harry Turtledove.  

 Plot summary .

An alternate history story set during the American Civil War, the story deals with a group of time-travelling Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (who conceal their true identities while restating their acronym as "America Will Break") members from 2014 who wish to alter the outcome of the Civil War and, as a result, insure the success of their own cause in the future. In order to do this, they provide the South with a large number of AK-47s.  To all but a few Confederate leaders, who are told the truth, they are known as "Rivington men" after the (fictional) North Carolina town where they set up their base.

The Confederacy, starting to reel towards defeat in the late winter of 1863-64, welcomes the guns and other supplies.  The armies of the Confederacy are trained in their use, and when the opposed armies break camp to fight the Battle of the Wilderness, there is an overwhelming Confederate victory rather than the inconclusive result in our timeline.  Lee's army defeats the Union again near Bealeton, Virginia, crosses the Potomac, and in a daring night battle, captures Washington, DC.  With parallel successes by Confederate troops on other fronts, U.S. President Lincoln has little choice but to sign an armistice, agreeing to the withdrawal of Union troops, and negotiations to determine a final border.

During those negotiations, the Confederacy abandons claims to West Virginia and Maryland, while the United States cedes the Indian Territory, with Kentucky and Missouri to hold state-wide referendum votes to determine which nation they will join.  After the completion of the negotiations, voting, and political conversation during which a minor incident occurs where two members of the AWB are caught by Union pickets attempting to smuggle AK-47s into the disputed states referenda are held where Kentucky chooses to join the Confederacy while Missouri chooses to remain with the Union. General Lee returns to his duties in Virginia with the hope of finally settling down with his family, including his ailing wife, at their home, Arlington House, for the remainder of their days.

Such is not to be.  Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, makes clear his wish that Lee be the next man to hold the position.  The AWB, whose goal from the beginning had been to maintain the Confederacy as a bastion of Black oppression, feel that Lee is too soft on the question of slavery and rally behind General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a member of the Confederate cavalry, in the hopes of electing him to office.  A slave trader himself, Forrest is believed to be the perfect man for the job of maintaining the standard of white supremacy.  

The election is hotly contested, both men heroes of the recent War and filled with charisma, but Lee emerges the victor despite the introduction of 20th and 21st century campaigning techniques by the AWB to bolster Forrest's one-note campaign to preserve slavery in the South.  Several of the states which voted for Forrest begin to call for secession from the Confederacy and the creation of their own nation, echoing the original Southern secession after the election of Lincoln to the Union's presidency.  However, Forrest feels that such an action would be nothing short of petulance and concedes defeat, offering his personal service in the Confederate Army if any states do attempt to secede.

Lee is presented with a stolen book from the future, proving that the Rivington men lied about the catastrophes which they claimed lay in wait for the South if it lost the war.  He confronts Rhoodie.  The AWB has no chance of influence over Lee, and, at the presidential inauguration, several of its members attempt to assassinate Lee.  They attack now-President Lee armed with UZIs and shielded with kevlar (or a similar material) vests (both still a mystery to the Confederacy) and manage to kill a number of prominent Confederates, including Lee's newly-inaugurated Vice President Albert Gallatin Brown and General Jubal Early. Lee survives the attempt on his life by nothing more than pure luck, though his wife is killed.  The AWB forces in Richmond are attacked, and, after a fierce battle, are finally defeated.  Their offices contain many items from the 21st century that are a mystery to the soldiers who discover them  gas-powered electrical generators, fluorescent lighting, and a Macintosh computer (which Lee calls a "QWERTY" for the keys)   but most importantly contains dozens of historical texts that reveal not only the AWB's true intentions, but that they had twisted the historical facts so as to present the South's defeat as far worse than it actually was. All of these are contained in a secure area at the AWB headquarters in Richmond, behind a safe-like door which the Confederates lack the technology to defeat, but eventually "outflank" (Instead of breaking down the door, they break through an outer wall of the building).

After the capture of the AWB's Richmond offices, Lee presents before the Confederate leadership all the historical documents that the men from the future used to inform themselves of the events of the present time.  With the view of hindsight, which is always 20/20, they see how the issue of slavery is almost universally reviled in the future and that, where they had hoped to be vindicated for their actions by their descendants, practically the entirety of the world viewed the Civil War and Southern Secession to be little more than a crime against humanity itself.  With this new information, Congress is more inclined to agree to Lee's plan to pass a bill for gradual emancipation of its entire slave population.  The bill itself was modelled after a proposed act of legislation in slave-holding Brazil, though the real bill was not proposed until years after the setting of the novel, and Turtledove notes in an afterword that it is anachronistic.

Lee orders the Confederate army against the AWB.  However, the AWB have managed to secure control over an area around Rivington, due largely to elements of their advanced technology which they have not shared with Lee's men (including mines, mortars, walkie-talkies, flak jackets, and so-called "endless repeaters", in reality belt-fed machine guns that prevented any form of massed advance on the AWB lines), and they manage to successfully repel all Confederate attempts to retake their territory.  With the AWB resupplied from the future, the conflict appears to be a stalemate.  With a newly reinstated Forrest in command, it is a brilliant strategy by Lt. Colonel Henry Pleasants, a former Union officer who remained in the South after he had been captured during the War, that finally allows the Confederates to breach the AWB perimeter.  The Confederate forces manage to overcome the AWB's superior technology through sheer numbers and determination. The AWB combatants are eventually defeated, and those who are unable to escape in their time machine are captured.  Rhoodie surrenders, but is killed by one of his slaves in retaliation for severe mistreatment.  Most of the Rivington men kept their slaves under deplorable conditions and, despite years of tradition which demand the slave be put to death, even the Confederate soldiers believe Rhoodie deserved what he got, quickly ordering the slave to flee the area.

The surviving AWB members are held in a Confederate prison under constant guard. While all face a sentence of death, proceedings are on indefinite stay so long as those willing to cooperate assist in bridging the gaps in the information presented in the historical texts and technological items recovered following the AWB's defeat.  Although some gaps would prove almost impossible to fill due to numerous generations of technological advancements 1870s technology would be far too immature to attempt to repair a 21st century computer at the component level, for example most of the AWB survivors agree to cooperate much in the same way captured German scientists cooperated with their Soviet captors they can cooperate or die.

Analysis.

The story is told alternately from the third-person perspectives of General Lee himself and of First Sergeant Nate Caudell, an actual historical figure who served in the 47th North Carolina. This enables the reader to witness events from both "the top" and "the bottom", on the battlefield in the early part of the book and later in the civilian life of the post-war Confederacy. The realities of the situation gradually reveal themselves as Lee learns more about his dubious allies, while Caudell also hears increasingly disturbing rumors about the situation at Rivington - with the concluding explosive confrontation with the AWB again seen alternately from the two distinct viewpoints.  

Turtledove used historical records of an actual Confederate Army unit, the 47th North Carolina, to flesh out his list of characters.  All the characters in the book are mentioned with the actual ranks they held in the 47th - including Mollie Bean, who as a woman masqueraded as a male Confederate soldier for most of the War before being wounded and captured by Union forces - as well as their civilian employment if it is known.

Awards.
The book won the John Esten Cooke Award for Southern Fiction in 1993.

Trivia.
 Dr. Turtledove has an entire (unrelated) book series, known among fans as Timeline-191, on an alternate history in which the Confederacy won the Civil War.  Though this time, not through deus ex machina intervention by time travel.  Instead the famous 'lost orders' are found by other Confederates, the Union does not learn of Lee's plans and a battle equivalent to the Battle of Antietam results in decisive Confederate victory.

 The idea of a time traveller bringing advanced weapons to Confederates is also the theme of Harry Harrison's book A Rebel In Time.  The two treatments are, however, very different.

 Several of the characters, or at least South African people with the same name, appeared in S. M. Stirling's book Conquistador. They weren't very succesful there, either.

<doc id="6993463" title="Eri Sawachika" nonfiltered="321" processed="320" dbindex="450323">

 is a character from the manga/anime series School Rumble.

One of Tenma Tsukamoto's close friends, Eri's father is a wealthy European and her mother is half-Japanese. She has great difficulty with Kanji. Eri is extremely wealthy and somewhat spoiled (Western Europeans in Japan are stereotyped to be billionaires and extremely snobby). Eri is devoted to her father, but cannot spend as much time with him as she wants because of his work commitments.

Several events (such as being comforted by Kenji Harima when her father goes overseas, being confessed to by mistake, seeing his naked body twice, his victory at the school sports day on her behalf, etc.) cause Eri to develop an attraction to Harima that she refuses to admit to herself and her friends. She tries hard to hate him (especially when Harima acts like a jerk whenever she tries to be nice to him) but somehow her feelings for him kept getting stronger. She becomes very jealous and angry towards anyone rumoured to date Harima, which causes a strain in her relations with Mikoto Su  and Yakumo Tsukamoto. 

Eri was mistakenly thinking that Harima was liking her for some time (most memorable moment was when Eri was asking Harima what kind of girl he likes on behalf of Tenma, who in turn is asking on behalf of Yakumo), until she realized his true feelings are for Tenma, and now she has a hard time trying to attract his attention.

Note: Harima usually calls Sawachika with an alternative nickname: "Oj  (  )" (literally "young lady" or "miss", but used only to address someone of high social status)

The Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Polish also know as a Polski Owczarek Nizinny), also just PON, is a medium sized, shaggy-coated, sheep dog breed native to Poland. 

The Appearance
The PON is a muscular, thick-coated dog.  The double coat can be of any color or pattern, of white, gray, and brown are most common, with black, gray, or brown markings. It is common for colors to fade as the dogs reach adulthood.  The undercoat is soft and dense, while the topcoat is rough and either straight or wavy, but not curly.  The hair around the head makes the head appear to be larger than it actually is, and typically covers the eyes.  

Males are 45   50 cm (18   20 inches) in height at the withers, while females are 42   47 cm (17   19 inches). The body is not square, but rectangular; the ratio of the height to the body length should be 9:10 (a 45 cm tall dog should have a body 50 cm long).  The tail is either very short or docked. Some undocked dogs have tails that curl over the back.

 Temperament .
Polish lowland sheepdog's are stable and self-confident, but are wary of strangers.  They have an excellent memory and can be well trained, but may dominate a weak-willed owner. PONs adapt well to various conditions, and are  popular as companion dogs for apartment dwellers in their native Poland. PONs require a moderate amount of exercise daily. PONs also possess a very unique personality.

History.
Known in its present form in Poland from at least the thirteenth century, the PON is most likely descended from the Puli and the herding dogs of the Huns. 

Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514, and brought six PONs to move the sheep.  A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded a ram and two ewes for a dog and two bitches.  These dogs were bred with the local Scottish dogs to produce the Scottish herding dogs, most obviously the Bearded Collie.

Almost driven to extinction in World War II, the PON was restored mainly through the work of Dr. Danuta Hryeniewicz and her dog, Smok (en:Dragon), the ancestor of all PONs in the world today, who sired the first ten litters of PONs in the 1950s.  The breed standard was written with Smok as the model, and accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1959.

In the American television program Gilmore Girls, Lorelai Gilmore's dog Paul Anka is a Polish Lowland Sheepdog.

 Health .
In general, PONs are a very,very,very healthy breed. Animals should be checked for hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy before being used for breeding. PONs require a low protein diet.  The life expectancy of a PON is 12 to 15 years.

<doc id="496074" title="¦ubi?" nonfiltered="332" processed="331" dbindex="450334">

The ¦ubi  were one of the twelve tribes which constituted Croatian statehood in the Middle Ages; they held the county of Bribir (Varvaria) in inland Dalmatia.

Today Bribir is an archaeological site in inland Dalmatia. It is located on a flat hill about fifteen kilometres northwest of Skradin, nearby the old Zadar road which goes through Benkovac to ¦ibenik. Under the steep rocks of its western side there is the source of the Bribir ica stream and from here the rich and fertile Bribir-Ostrovica field spreads out. The hill of Bribir, an ideal place to control the surrounding territory, was perfect for human habitation during all ages. The one who held it had control over all roads and approaches from the sea to the hinterland and so man has dwelled here since the Old Stone Age. There was a settlement as early as the beginning of the older Iron Age, expanding and developing during the Liburnian period, continuing during the Roman domination, and lasting to the end of the Middle Ages. During the Roman period Bribir, known as Varvaria, had the status of municipium and was the centre of one of the fourteen Liburnian counties. 

The Byzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus writing in the X century about the Croats settling in Dalmatia in the VII century describes how this people had organised their country into eleven counties (zupanias) one of which was Breberi, centred on site of the old Varvaria. The county stretched between the Zrmanja river to the W and Petrovo polje to the E, straddling the Krka and  ikola rivers. A line of hills separated it from the territory of Knin to the N and to the S it bordered on Skradin. It was held by a clan that in coeval documents is referred to as nobiles, comites or principes Breberienses. These Breberienses belonged to the ¦ubi  tribe, one of the twelve which composed Croatian statehood in the Middle Ages and one of the six from which the Ban, or viceroy, was chosen. The original arms of this clan of nobles is a wing argent on a shield gules. Argent and gules are the colours of the papal party (guelfs) and of Croatia. The coat of arms could be derived from the winged shield standard of the royal chamberlain, a post held by Budez postelnic berberensis jupanus (1069). 

In recent history books whenever members of this clan are mentioned in relation to their prominent role in the XIII and XIV centuries the surname of ¦ubi  is conferred upon them by the historian. This was not the way, however, that the members called themselves at the time. During the Middle Ages every man in Croatia bore four names: the name given at baptism, the patronym, the name of the clan which was also the name of the settlement in which it lived, and the tribal affiliation. In the period between 1069 to the destruction of the county by the Turks in 1520, the many personages of the clan that emerge from the original Latin documents qualify themselves as de Breberio preceded by their Christian name and patronym; only rarely do they add their tribal affiliation. The seal of Paul (Pavao) (+1312), the greatest figure of the clan, has the following lettering on it: + S(igillum). PAULI BREBERIENSIS BANI TOCIUS SCLAVONIE. Thus, in the vulgar the surname would be Breber or some variant (Brebir, Bribirski, Breberi , Brebri ). The XIX century erudite Croatian historians who wrote the first history books for the public opted for ¦ubi  which, in the ardent nationalistic spirit of the time, sounded reassuringly Slavic as compared to Breber. 

During the reign of Dmitar Zvonimir (1075-1089), the mythical golden age of the kingdom of Croatia, the highest court offices of postelnik (comes camerarius) and tepizo (comes palatinus) are held by Budez and Dominicus, both of the lineage. During the XIII and XIV centuries Brebers are many times called to cover the post of count in the townships of Split, Trogir, Skradin and Omi¨. In the documents which have come down to us it is possible to identify six different branches of the Breber clan. The most illustrious of which is the one descended from iupanus Miroslaus Brebriensis, filius Bogdanizi (1184). His great-grandson Paul, mentioned above, reaches the peak of power towards the end of the XIII century. He is Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, his rule extends to Bosnia, and with his brothers he controls the maritime cities of Dalmatia. In these regions he is the champion of the Pope and is instrumental in placing Charles, the firstborn of the King of Naples, on the throne of Hungary and Croatia. He is related to the King of Naples, the King of Serbia, the Da Camino lords of Treviso, and the Tiepolo and Dandolo patricians of Venice. When he dies (1312) his eldest son Mladen tries to keep the hold over the other Croatian clans but is unsuccessful and bit by bit loses lands, castles and towns.

In 1347 King Louis I of Hungary confers on this branch of the Brebers, in the persons of Count Gregory and Count George, respectively son and nephew of Ban Paul, the castle of Zrin in exchange of the strategically important castle of Ostrovica, their last holding outside of ancestral Breber. This branch will be thenceforth known with the surname of Zrin (a Zrinio, Zrinsky, Zrinyi, Zrini, de Serin) and will again rise to heights of fame and glory with Count Nicholas IV, the hero of Szigetvar (1566), and with Count Nicholas VII (1616-1664), the Scourge of the Ottomans.

Marcus Forstall, the secretary of the latter, compiled a history of the Zrins, tracing it back to the Brebers, to the tribe of ¦ubi , and from here to the Roman gens Sulpicia who, according to Suetonius, sprang from the love of Zeus for Pasiphae. A feeling for classical antiquity was a cultural feature of the Renaissance and the wish to establish a link with the great tradition of Rome was a common vanity of those times. The claim of the Zrins, however, is not totally groundless. During the times of the Roman Empire, Dalmatia was a senatorial province and would have affiliations with the patrician families of the capital. Varvaria was, in fact, a Roman municipium under Italic law. Other clans in Dalmatia like the Karin, the Gusi  and some of the patrician families from the maritime cities also claimed the same origins.

The greatness of the house of Zrin ended with the famous trial of Vienna (1671) regarding the Zrinski-Frankopan plot. Of the last counts, Adam fell in the cavalry charge against the Turks at Salankemen in 1671 and Antun, after having brilliantly fought against the French, fell in disgrace and died in prison in 1703.

Another branch of the clan, descended from a Petrus living at the beginning of the XIV century, owes its rise to having remained unshakeably loyal to Sigismund of Luxemburg, the future Holy Roman Emperor (1411), in his struggle for the crown of Hungary-Croatia against Ladislas of Durazzo. Nicholas, James and John, nobiles de Breberio, are confirmed in their possessions, James is nominated Viceban, and they receive the castle of Perna with all the appurtenances. This family from now on known as Perenyi (Peransky, de Perén, a Pernya) will be numbered amongst the magnates of Hungary up to the XX century. Gabriel Perényi and bishop Francis Perényi fell fighting in the fateful Battle of Mohács (29th August, 1526).

Also destined to wealth and power are the descendants of Ugrinus (died 1335). Known under the nickname of Meli , then Melith, which later became their surname, they obtained vast estates in Transylvania.

Besides these particular offshoots which went their separate ways, a numerous kin continued to abide by the ancient holding of Breber. In 1324 when the citizenship of Zadar was conferred on the "nobiles domini de Briberio", 190 members of the clan presented themselves for the investiture. In 1353 the Ottoman Turks crossed the Dardanelles and began their invasion of Europe. In the XV century Bosnia was already a pashalik from where raids would be carried into Croatia-Dalmatia. The feudal levies and the clan warriors had no hope against the Turkish war machine and met their fate in the battle of Krbavsko Polje (1493). The castle of Breber was caught on the front between the Turkish, Hungarian and Venetian armies and by 1520 had become a desolate waste of rubble. Last news giving the comites Breberienses still in their ancient seat is in the diocesan synod of Skradin held at the time of bishop Archangel (1490-1502). The Turkish terror displaced large portions of the population of Dalmatia-Croatia. Some sought refuge in the cities of the coast, some crossed the sea to Italy, others, especially those belonging to the nobility, resettled to the north in that part of Slavonia still under the crown of Hungary-Croatia. Their clan organisation definitely disrupted, the single Breber families settled in various places in the county of Zagreb (Turopolje, Beryzlawcz, Draganoscz, Chernkowcz, Threm, Jezenowcz, Koruscy, Zthobycza). Many Breber families are still living there to this day.

 Famous members of Zrinski family .

Count Martino Zrinski or Sdrigna, was born on 1462 and was the son of Count Pietro II and brother of Nikola III, father of Nikola IV, the one who is referred to in history as Nikola the Great Zrinski of Sighed. Martino Zrinski was the first of the Zrinski family who lived since then in Cefalonia Greece, by the name of Sdrin, Sdrinia. 

Count Nikola Zrinski, (born 1508) the ban of Dalmatia, Slavonia and Croatia, the commander of Szeged (since 1561) and the Habsburg commander in western Hungary (since 1563); the most courageous and prominent member of the Zrinski family, which together with the Frankopans was the most distinguished and famous noble family in the Croatian history. He established his reputation as a fearless warrior in the defense of Vienna in 1529, and in the victory over the Turks at Budapest 1529. As Croatian Ban, he persistently advocated Croatian interests. He acquired immortal fame for himself and Croatia in the Battle of Szigetvár in 1566.  More than 100.000 well-armed Turks, headed by the famed Suleiman the Magnificent and Grand Vezier Mehmed-Pasha Sokolovi , besieged the fortress of Szeged from August 7th to September 7th, 1566. Zrinski, with "two thousand three hundred and a few more" warriors defended it, until the charge from the fortress, in which he was killed. The Sultan offered Nikola Zrinski the crown of Croatia in vain. The destiny of Europe was at stake then, and Zrinski and his company of Croatian knights chose to defend the interests of the Christian West. Sultan Suleiman died during the battle, so the Grand Vezier abandoned that military expedition and returned to Constantinople. 

The Zrinski era lasted for whole 145 years The Zrinskis were not only distinguished warlords famous after their heroism in fighting the Turks, but also poets and book-lovers. The Zrinski family is considered to have played the most important role in the cultural history of Me imurje (northern part of Croatia, near the border of Slovenia and Hungary). In order to understand the Zrinski epoch better, it is necessary to get to know the Zrinski family better. 

Nikola's IV son, Giorgio V (Juraj) inherited his father's property, but he more interested in books than in chivalry. He became enthusiastic about Lutheranism which he did not accept, but forced the people to turn Protestant as well. He persecuted Catholic priests and devastated a number of the churches, especially the famous Paulist monastery at Sveta Helena, which did him no credit, of course. But, on the other hand, he founded the first printing office at Nedeli¨ e (near  akovec) in 1574, when there was no other printing office in Croatia. 

His son, Giorgio VI (Juraj Jr.) turned back to Catholicism and "purified" Me imurje from Lutheranism. He was in complete succession to the famous warlord Nikola Sdrin - he was a brave and fearless warrior famous for fighting the Turks at Palanka. Unfortunately his chivalry and rapier-tonguedness were a thorn in his superior's, general Albrecht von Wallenstein's side and von Wallenstein had Giorgio poisoned after a verbal duel in 1626.

Elephant Beetles, Megasoma elephas, are part of the Scarabaeidae family and the subfamily Dynastinae.  They are classified with the Neotropical rhinoceros beetles. 

Appearance.  
Elephant beetles are black in color and their body is covered with a coat of small fine microscopic hairs, which is particularly thick on the beetle's elytra.  The males have two horns protruding from their head and another from their prothorax.  The females have no horns.  The males' horns purpose is a defense mechanism in competition against other males for food and mates. 

Size.
In size, elephant Beetles range between 70-120 mm and the males have even extended over 120 mm.  Males are around 2 to 3 sizes bigger than the females.
The elephant beetle is often known the be purple with stripes down its back. It also has a gaping mouth and a big hole in the middle of it

Location.
Elephant Beetles are located in Central America, southern part of Mexico, and South American rainforests.

Breeding.
Elephant Beetle's larvae develop in large decaying logs and take up to four years to develop into an adult beetle.  The female Elephant Beetle lays her eggs into the decaying log.  the egg stage takes around 3 weeks.  The next stage, the larvae stage takes around 29 weeks with the C-shape larvae (also called white grubs) have brown heads and six legs and consume organic matter.  The third and last stage, the pupal stage lasts around 5 weeks at a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius.  The life span of an adult Elephant Beetle is around four months. 

Food.
For their diet, Elephant Beetles eat the sap of particular trees and ripened fallen fruits such as pineapples.  They also eat longan, lychee fruit, and bark from certain trees like the poinciana.

Other Facts.
Elephant Beetles are mainly active during the night.
Elephant Beetles are also able to maintain high body temperatures with temperature decrease.
Their population has been depleted by the slash and burning of the rainforests, which has reduced their grounds for mating.

SpywareStrike is a rogue anti-spyware program. This means that it pretends to be an anti-spyware program, but it is a security risk since it gives exaggerated information about the computers security status so that the user would buy the full commercial version. 

Like SpyAxe, this program will invade your computer through the zlob trojan (and possibly others), popping up frequent alerts to "upgrade". If you click on the alert, you'll pay  for a program that does nothing to protect you against spyware, and even opens up additional security holes on your PC.

<doc id="1364938" title="Silver Nemesis" nonfiltered="343" processed="341" dbindex="450345">

Silver Nemesis is a serial in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in the UK in three weekly parts from November 23 (the series 25th anniversary) to December 7, 1988.  Featuring Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor, Silver Nemesis reflected a darker turn in Doctor Who storylines, with the intention being to reveal the secrets of the Doctor.

Synopsis.
Stuart period time-traveller Lady Peinforte, Neo-Nazis, Cybermen and the Seventh Doctor converge in the grounds of an English stately home seeking to control a powerful Time Lord weapon, known as the Nemesis.

Plot.

This is based on the Extended Version presented on the VHS release rather than that originally broadcast.

South America, 22 November 1988. In an office full of Nazi regalia and a portrait of Adolf Hitler on the wall,  a man looks at a computer screen displaying details on which he sees "Landing Location, Windsor, Grid Ref: 74W 32N, November 23 1988". He rushes out to his superior, De Flores, who is about to shoot a noisy parrot out of a tree with a crossbow and tells him that he has wonderful news. The two enter the mansion.

Windsor, England, 1638. A finely dressed woman is shooting pigeons with a bow and arrow whilst her servant looks on. In her house, an elderly mathematician is performing complex calculations. The woman enters and demands to know how long his work will take, but he is too engrossed in his work to answer her. She goes to the fireplace, and picking up a poisoned arrow, hands it to her servant and tells him to put it with the others. He enquires after a silver arrow, and she replies that she will deal with that arrow personally. 

Back in the Nazi office, De Flores addresses a group of followers, telling them they are at the turning point of history. He proposes a toast to the fourth Reich, before taking a silver bow from a display case, preparing to board an aircraft.

In space, a comet is seen from which a glowing energy emanates  Back in Windsor, the mathematician finally reveals the result of his calculations to the woman, telling her that the Nemesis comet circles the earth every 25 years, and its decaying trajectory means that it will eventually fall to Earth from the point where it originally departed   the meadow outside. This will occur on 23 November 1988.

At a jazz performance by Courtney Pine, the Seventh Doctor and Ace relax and enjoy the music. Ace's newspaper has a story about a comet heading to Earth, but she is more interested in the football results. The Doctor hears a bleeping from his pocket watch, and wonders of what it is trying to remind him. Pine's performance ends to applause and Ace asks him to sign a tape for her. As they head back to the TARDIS, a concealed marksman raises a gun towards them. At the sound of gunfire, Ace and the Doctor duck down and retreat quickly towards the TARDIS, but have to jump in the river to escape their pursuers. Two men arrive wielding guns and wearing headsets, but assuming they must have got their targets leave again. The Doctor and Ace then struggle back on to the river bank, safe now.

In 1638, the mathematician dreams of great inventions that he could discover. The lady tells her servant to bring forth the potion, and he replies that they only require the final ingredient, human blood. They look meaningfully towards the mathematician 

The Doctor fetches out a new tape deck that he has built to replace the one of Ace's that had been destroyed by the Daleks. This one however, can do much more than play tapes. Telling Ace that his reminder had a terminal rating meaning some planet somewhere is facing imminent destruction, an image of the planet Earth appears on the tape deck 

In 1638, the woman and her servant drink their magic potion and begin and are surrounded by a glowing miasma, and beginning to travel forwards through time. They appear in present day Windsor in the middle of a cafe, somewhat to the surprise of its customers.

Admitting that he has known about the possible destruction of Earth for 350 years, the Doctor and Ace tack a quick trip in the TARDIS to Windsor Castle. Rummaging around in its basement, the Doctor tells Ace he is looking for a silver bow. 

As the comet finally hits Earth, the Stuart woman's arrow begins to pulsate with light. In the castle, the Doctor and Ace feel the force of the impact. The Doctor tells Ace that it is the return to Earth of a comet called Nemesis, and then reveals that it was he who had launched it into space in the first place. Led by their glowing bow, the group of Nazis head towards the comet in a van. De Flores is in no rush to retrieve the Nemesis yet, as the comet will be too hot due its descent through the atmosphere. He tells his soldiers they will wait in a hotel leaving British police to guard the site, unaware of the true power of the Nemesis. In the castle, Ace finds a card telling the history of the bow, relating how it disappeared in 1788, and that unless a place is kept in the castle for its return, the entire silver statue will return to destroy the world. The Doctor tells her that the statue has indeed returned with that purpose. At this point, the lights dim, and Ace thinks it is a power cut.

Travelling back in time to 1638, the Doctor and Ace go to the time travelling woman's house in Windsor. Seeing the corpse of the mathematician, the Doctor hurriedly covers it with a cloth so that Ace does not see it. The Doctor sees the mathematician's calculations and is impressed that he had been able to work out when the Nemesis comet will return to Earth, only months since the Doctor's previous visit. The Doctor reveals that the woman   Lady Peinforte   made the Nemesis statue depicting herself out of a silver metal that fell to Earth in the meadow outside her house. The Doctor sees a chess board, the game is going rather badly. He tells Ace that Peinforte managed to travel forward in time to 1988 using the arrow and a rudimentary knowledge of time travel, but mostly black magic. He says that she has a nose for secrets. The Doctor tells Ace the statue is made of a living metal   Validium   which is capable of great destruction. 

Peinforte and her servant Richard withdraw from the statue to assess the strength of the police guarding it. The police are having their own problems, their radios are not working, the batteries are dead. Around the comet crash site, vents emerge from the ground spewing gas, causing the policemen to choke and fall unconscious.

The TARDIS materialises outside Windsor Castle in 1988. The Doctor and Ace follow a group of tourists on a guided tour. Seeing a no entry sign, they sneak into the castle. Hearing the bark of dogs, they see a woman coming towards them with several corgis. The Doctor tells Ace to look like they own the place, because that always works. Although the Doctor does not recognise the woman, Ace immediately realises that it is the Queen Elizabeth II and drags him into hiding. However, when she tells him who it was, he races after the Queen, saying they need the armed forces and police on their side, and what better person could they ask? The Doctor and Ace are seized by security guards before they can get anywhere near the Queen. The Doctor informs them that they got into the castle by travelling in time and space, but they are incredulous. The Doctor tells them the fate of every living person is in danger, but the guards do not believe him. The Doctor dons a pair of oversized glasses and glaring at them intones, "you will believe me! you will let us go!" Distracted by this spectacle, the Doctor and Ace flee into the corridors of the castle. As they run, Ace sees a portrait of herself hanging on a stairwell wall. When she says she does not remember this happening, the Doctor tells her that it has not happened yet. 

Richard asks Peinforte what she will do when she gains control of the Nemesis, and she replies that first she will exact revenge on that "predictable little man". She predicts that he will soon arrive, and tells Richard she knows the secret of the "nameless Doctor." 

De Flores and his Nazis make their move for the Nemesis comet and see the unconscious policemen. He takes the bow case and places it on the comet, and within the Nemesis statue begins to glow. The Doctor and Ace arrive, and De Flores demands they hand over the arrow. The Doctor reveals that the bow and arrow give the Validium metal critical mass. The Doctor confronts De Flores and asks if he has observed the advanced technology which has been used to attack the policemen, and the power blackouts that have been occurring over the last few days. De Flores threatens to shoot Ace if they do not tell him where the arrow is, but at this moment a large spacecraft lands near the crash site. The doors open and from within emerge a troop of Cybermen 

----

The Cyberleader recognises the Doctor, even though his appearance has changed, and tells the onlookers that the Cybermen had predicted his presence. The Nazis open fire on the Cybermen but their bullets are ineffective. The Cybermen open fire and drive the Nazis away. The Doctor says that this happened before, but before it was the Roundheads and Lady Peinforte. Peinforte shoots one of the Cybermen with a bow and arrow. De Flores finds one of her arrows and sees that it is gold-tipped. Peinforte and Richard withdraw, allowing the Nazis and the Cybermen to fight it out, hoping to retrieve the Nemesis in the aftermath. In the confusion, the Doctor and Ace manage to seize the silver bow and return to the TARDIS. Peinforte sees this and tries to shoot them, but her arrow thuds into the TARDIS door just as it dematerialises.

While Peinforte and Richard enter the town of Windsor, the Cybermen begins to cut the Nemesis statue free of the comet. The Doctor and Ace go back to Peinforte's house in 1638. The body of the mathematician has gone, and the chess pieces have also been moved. The Doctor tells Ace that although the mathematician was a genius, he had needed a little help to get started. The Doctor picks up a piece of paper from the desk and throws it into the fireplace. Making a further move on the chess board, they leave.

Materialising back in the present day, the Doctor explains that Validium was created on Ancient Gallifrey by Omega and Rassilon as the ultimate defence. Some of it however left Gallifrey, and now they must stop Peinforte or anyone else reuniting the statue, the bow and the arrow. Using the bow to lead them, they proceed in the direction of the statue. 

In Windsor, Peinforte and Richard are confronted by two thugs. Asking if they are social workers, the thugs demand money. Soon after, the pair of skinheads are seen hanging tied up by their ankles in a tree, whilst their cloths burn on a bonfire. The Doctor uses the tape deck to start transmitting a signal, which interferes with the Cybermen's communications. As they proceed, they see the pair of thugs still tied up, and are surprised when they hear that social workers did this to them. 

As Richard is terrified by the sight of a bizarre creature, a llama, Peinforte tells him that if he does not help her retrieve the Nemesis, she will abandon him in this future time. He then sees that they are standing by a memorial statue. She tells him that it is his tomb, placed in the grounds of her own burial place. The arrow starts glowing and they realise that that is where the Cybermen have taken the Nemesis statue. As they scour the tomb for Nemesis, the Cybermen prepare to attack, but realising they are armed with gold arrows retreat. Opening up her grave, they see that it does not contain her bones.

The Doctor asks Ace if she ignored his instructions and prepared any Nitro-9 explosive. When she denies it, he tells her to blow up the Cybermen's spacecraft. He distracts the Cyberman-controlled human guards, and Ace throws her rucksack into the vehicle causing an explosion destroying it completely. When the Cybermen return, they think the human guards have betrayed them and kill them. De Flores approaches the Cybermen and starts to quote Wagner comparing themselves to supermen and the Cybermen to giants. He strikes a deal with the Cyberleader to kill Peinforte and Richard in exchange for a share of control of Earth after its conquest. The Cybermen have no intention of honouring the deal, and plan to kill the Nazis after the death of Peinforte.

The Doctor tells Ace that every time the Nemesis comet approached Earth in its 25 year orbit, it caused destruction: in 1913, the eve of the First World War; 1938, Hitler annexes Austria; 1963 Kennedy assassinated, and now it is 1988. They use the tape deck scanner trying to find the cyber-fleet. 

Opening up the grave fully, Peinforte gazes upon her own image shown on the Nemesis statue. However, De Flores and his man arrives with guns, and Richard has only one arrow left. In fear, he hands over the arrow to De Flores and drags Peinforte away leaving the Nazis in control of Nemesis. De Flores believes he now has all three parts of the Validium. Placing the arrow in the statues hands, it becomes more animated. The Cybermen arrive and ask De Flores where the bow is. When he opens the case he sees that he does not have it at all.

The Doctor sees a chameleon and realises the Cyber-fleet is shrouded, and making the adjustment to the tape deck reveals the entire fleet of Cyber-warships, thousands of them 

----

The Doctor decides to activate the Validium by taking the bow to the crypt. When Ace seems frightened, the Doctor tells her she can wait in the TARDIS, but she refuses and wants to accompany the Doctor. 

Meanwhile, De Flores realises he has overplayed his hand and tries to negotiate with the Cyberleader. The Cyberleader orders his lieutenant to kill De Flores, but he throws gold dust in the leader's face and flees. The other Nazi however turns on De Flores and offers him to the Cybermen, asking to be made into a Cyberman himself. The two Nazis are then taken to be prepared for Cyber-conversion. As the Doctor and Ace arrive at the crypt, the jazz tape finishes playing and the Cybermen's communications begin working. The Doctor enters the crypt holding the bow, and manoeuvring past the Cybermen with Ace places the bow in the Statue's hands but snatches it away again. The statue awakens and begins to follow the bow. 

Going back to 1638, the Doctor continues his chess game against his unknown opponent. Ace asks him who brought the Validium to Earth in the first place, and what is really going on but he remains silent. Taking a bag of gold coins, they leave. 

Peinforte begins to rant about all power being hers and her intent to retrieve the Nemesis. They come to the road, and attempt to hitch a lift in a passing car. Richard stands with his thumb out but no cars stops for them. Seeing this fail, Peinforte steps into the middle of the road. A large car stops, and an American woman offers to take them into Windsor. She tells them that she is in England discovering her roots. Revealing she is descended from the 17th century Remington family, Peinforte calls them thieves and swindlers. Mentioning a Dorothea Remington, the American woman recognises the name, and Peinforte knows that Dorothea died in 1621 from a slow poison. 

With the Cybermen set off after the Nemesis and the Doctor, De Flores is released from his bonds by his man, who had deceived the Cybermen into thinking he had betrayed the Nazi leader. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ace materialise inside the hangar containing the comet. Soon the Nemesis statue arrives, and the Doctor gives it the bow. The Nemesis speaks to Ace telling her that it was fashioned by Peinforte into its current beautiful form, but that it has also had horrific forms in the past, and will again in the future. The Cybermen arrive and Ace shoots one down using a gold coin and a sling shot. The Cybermen pursue her, but she manages to elude them. The Doctor sets the trajectory of the rocket sled containing the Nemesis, headed for the Cyber-fleet. Ace becomes trapped on a gantry between two Cybermen and the Cyberleader, with only a single remaining gold coin. The Cybermen lift their guns to shoot her, but she fires the gold coin at the Cyberleader and ducks, causing the other two Cybermen to shoot each other instead. The Nemesis asks the Doctor if she must destroy the entire Cyber-fleet, to which he says that she must. She asks the Doctor whether she will be needed again, or whether she will have her freedom, but the Doctor hushes her. 

Ace arrives down from the gantry, but is surrounded by two more Cybermen. They demand that the Doctor hands the bow over to them, but the Doctor threatens to destroy the bow if they harm her. Placing it in front of the rocket sled engines, he grabs Ace. As the two Cybermen advance towards them, the engines fire killing the two Cybermen. However, up on the gantry the Cyberleader plucks the gold coin from its chest unit. De Flores arrives and picks up the bow. He speaks to the Nemesis, but she remains silent. The Cyberleader raises his gun and shoots De Flores dead, and demands that the Doctor hands over the bow. At this point, Peinforte and Richard arrive. Demanding the bow for herself, she asks Ace who the Doctor is, and whether she knows where he came from. Ace says that nobody knows who the Doctor is, but Peinforte says that she does. When Ace asks how, she says the Nemesis told her. The Doctor asks what will happen if he gives her the bow, to which Peinforte replies his power will be hers, but his secrets remain his own. Appearing to concede defeat, the Doctor says he is surrendering, but not to Peinforte, rather to the Cybermen. Peinforte threatens to reveal his secret, but he just tells her to proceed. She says that she will tell them of Gallifrey, of the Old Time, the time of Chaos. However, the Cyberleader says that the secrets of the Time Lords are of no interest of the Cybermen. 

The Cyberleader tells the Doctor to cancel the Nemesis's destructive capabilities. The Doctor asks the statue if she understands the Cyberleader's instructions, and she replies "perfectly". The triumphant Cyberleader tells the Doctor to set that statue's course to rendezvous with the Cyberfleet. He tells them that the Earth will become their new base planet, the new Mondas. Launching the Nemesis, Peinforte screams and throws herself into the rocket sled and merges with the Nemesis. The rocket sled takes off and heads out into space. It arrives in the midst of the Cyber-fleet and there is an enormous explosion, destroying all of the Cyber-warships. The Cyberleader asks how it is possible, and the Doctor replies that he merely asked if Nemesis had understood the instruction, but had not said anything about obeying them. The Cyberleader prepares to kill the Doctor, but Richard grabs the gold-tipped arrow from the TARDIS door, and stabs it into the Cyberleader's chest unit, finally killing it. 

The Doctor and Ace return Richard to 1638. There, Richard and a Stuart woman perform a concert for them. Ace asks the Doctor who he really is, but he just puts his finger to his lips

In print.

A novelisation of this serial, written by Kevin Clarke, was published by Target Books in November 1989.

Continuity.
When Ace refers to the Doctor as a Time Lord, Lady Peinforte is shown shaking her head as if to say, "No." The significance of this is never expanded upon in the story nor in any of the remaining televised Seventh Doctor stories, although a deleted scene from Remembrance of the Daleks had the Seventh Doctor claiming that he was "far more than just another Time Lord" and deleted scenes from Survival would have featured the Master challenging the Doctor's claim to be a Time Lord. These are part of what fans have dubbed the Cartmel Masterplan, an attempt by the show's script editor to revise (some say retcon) elements of the Doctor in order to return some mystery to the character. The series was cancelled before this could be followed up on screen, although the spirit of the masterplan was carried out in the subsequent original novels. (see The Other);
While the Cybermen's vulnerability to gold had been known of since Revenge of the Cybermen, the Cybermen are far more vulnerable to it in this story than they were previously. In Earthshock the Doctor had to feed fragments of gold directly into the Cyber-Leader's chest unit, and while the Leader was damaged, the Doctor needed to shoot it several times in order to finally kill it. In this serial, even a low-force impact with a gold (or gold plated) object proves instantly fatal to the Cybermen.
This is the last episode of the classic series to feature the Cybermen.
The Doctor says that Lady Peinforte can use black magic, the first time in the series that magic has been referred to and not immediately dismissed as trickery.  In The Curse of Fenric, it was implied that Fenric itself had manipulated these events to some degree, leaving the question open as to whether Peinforte used magic or merely believed she was using magic.
The literal use of Nazis continued the theme begun earlier that year by Remembrance of the Daleks, which returned to the original Terry Nation metaphor of the Daleks as Nazis. ;
Many fans have commented on the similarity of this story with Remembrance as well. Both stories involve the Doctor manipulating old enemies into destroying themselves with an artefact from Gallifrey's past.

Production.
Working titles for this story included The Harbinger and Nemesis.;
In this serial, the Doctor briefly encounters Queen Elizabeth II, played by an actress. The producers attempted to get the real monarch to appear on the program (just as members of the British Royal Family had appeared as themselves on Coronation Street), but arrangements could not be agreed.;
Permission was also refused for filming at Windsor Castle. Scenes set there were instead shot at Arundel Castle.;

Outside references.
The appearance of Anton Diffring as an aging Nazi was topical as, at the time, the Federal President of Austria Kurt Waldheim (the same age as Diffring and an officer in the German army during the Second World War) was accused of being a Nazi.

Broadcast and video releases.
Episodes two and three were the second and third respectively of the series ever to be premiered outside of the United Kingdom (the first being The Five Doctors), being shown as part of a compilation broadcast of the story on New Zealand's TVNZ, after part one had shown in the UK but prior to the other two being transmitted there.;
On 3 May 1993 an extended version of this three-part serial was released on VHS. Apart from featuring footage not shown in the original broadcast, the video included a short documentary looking back at the production of the adventure.

Sidewinder is a steel roller coaster located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. While the coaster itself is a standard Vekoma Boomerang, this installation is notable because it was the first Vekoma Boomarang to use Vekoma cars (previous Boomarangs used Arrow cars). This ride was also the first coaster installed in the park in 14 years since the SooperDooperLooper in 1977.

The ride begins with riders being pulled backwards out of the station up a hill by a cable winch.  At the top of the hill, the train is released, and speeds through the station and goes through the ride's three inversions, including one cobra roll and a loop.  The train goes up a second lift hill and, when it reaches the top, the lift disengages, and the train falls backwards through the inversions, returning to the station.

Trivia.
Sidewinder was built on a former catering area. This moved to the area that at the time was occupied by Kaptain Kid's Kove, and became Trailblazer's catering pavilion.;
When the ride opened, a refreshment stand opened in the back of the line. It still stands today, although the stand closed after a few short seasons.

Flavius Caper, Latin grammarian, flourished during the 2nd century.

He devoted special attention to the early Latin writers, and is highly spoken of by Priscian. Caper was the author of two works--De Lingua Latina and De Dubiis Generibus. These works in their original form are lost; but two short treatises entitled De Orthographia and De Verbis Dubiis have come down to us under his name, probably excerpts from the original works, with later additions by an unknown writer.

See F Osann, De Flavio Capro (1849), and review by W Christ in Philologus, xviii. 165-170 (1862), where several editions of other important grammarians are noticed; G Keil, De Flavio Grammatico, in Dissertationes Halenses, x. (1889); text in H Keil's Grammatici Latini, vii.

. Photo: July 13, 2003.]]Graham Parker (born November 18 1950 in London) is an English rock singer and songwriter.

Life and career.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Graham Parker sang in small-time English bands such as the Black Rockers and Deep Cut Three while working in dead-end jobs like a glove factory and a petrol station. In 1975, he recorded a few demo tracks in London with Dave Robinson, who would shortly found Stiff Records and who connected Parker with his first backing band of note.  

Graham Parker and the Rumour (Brinsley Schwarz and Martin Belmont on guitar, Bob Andrews on keyboards, Andrew Bodnar on bass and Steve Goulding on drums) formed in the summer of 1975 and began doing the rounds of the British pub rock scene. Their first album, Howlin' Wind, was released to acclaim in 1976 and rapidly followed by the stylistically similar Heat Treatment. A mixture of rock, ballads, and reggae-influenced numbers, these albums reflected Parker's early influences (Motown, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan,Van Morrison) and contained the songs which formed the core of Parker's live shows -- "White Honey", "Soul Shoes", "Lady Doctor", "Fool's Gold", and his early signature tune "Don't Ask Me Questions", which hit the top 40 in the UK. Parker and the Rumour built a reputation as incendiary live performers: the promotional album Live at Marble Arch was recorded at this time and shows off their raw onstage style. Like the pub rock scene he was loosely tied to, the singer's class-conscious lyrics and passionate vocals signaled a renewal of rock music as punk rock began to flower in Britain. 

Parker preceded the other "new wave" English singer-songwriters, Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson. Early in his career his work was often compared favorably to theirs, and for decades journalists would continue to categorize them together, long after the artists' work had diverged. Characteristically, Parker would not hesitate to criticize this habit with caustic wit. 

The first 2 albums' critical acclaim was generally not matched with LP sales. Graham Parker and the Rumour appeared on BBC television's Top of the Pops in 1976, performing their top 30 hit version of The Trammps' "Hold Back the Night".

At this point, Parker began to change his songwriting style, reflecting his desire to break into the American market. The first fruits of this new direction appeared on Stick To Me (1977). The album broke the top 20 on the UK charts but divided critical opinions, particularly with numbers like "The Heat in Harlem" -- the band's longest song at the time. Nick Lowe's production also came under fire: some critics complained that the band sounded thin and Parker's voice was mixed down, when in fact a studio mishap had compromised the original recordings and forced the group to remake the album on short notice. An official live album The Parkerilla, issued in 1978, showed that the Rumour's vibrant live style remained strong, though some critics saw Parker in a holding pattern 2 years after Heat Treatment. It was a crucial juncture for the young musician. 

Parker had long been dissatisfied with the performance of his US record company, Mercury Records, finally issuing in the 1979 single "Mercury Poisoning", a public kiss-off reminiscent of the Sex Pistols' "EMI". 

Energized by his new label, Arista, and the presence of legendary producer Jack Nitzsche, Parker followed with Squeezing Out Sparks, widely held to be the best album of his career. For this album, The Rumour's brass section, prominent on all previous albums, was jettisoned, resulting in a spare, intense rock backing for some of Parker's most brilliant songs. Of particular note was "You Can't Be Too Strong", one of rock music's rare songs to confront the topic of abortion, however ambivalently. 

Squeezing out Sparks is still ranked by fans and critics alike as one of the finest rock albums ever made.  Rolling Stone named it #335  on their 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.  In an early 1987 Rolling Stone list of their top 100 albums from 1967-1987, Squeezing Out Sparks was ranked at #45, while Howlin' Wind came in at #54 . The companion live album Live Sparks, sent to US radio stations as part of a concerted promotional campaign for Parker, showed how well the songs worked on stage, and included another snapping r&b cover, the Jackson 5's "I Want You Back". 

Although marginally less intense than its predecessor, 1980's The Up Escalator was Parker's highest-charting album in the UK and featured glossy production by Jimmy Iovine and guest vocals from Bruce Springsteen. Nevertheless it was Parker's last album with the Rumour, although guitarist Brinsley Schwarz would join most of the singer's albums through the decade's end. 

The 1980s were Parker's most commercially successful years, with well-financed recordings and radio and video play. Over the decade, the British press turned unkind to him, but he continued to tour the world with top backing bands, and his 1985 release Steady Nerves included his only US Top 40 hit, "Wake Up (Next to You)". The singer began living mostly in the United States during this time.

An uncompromising attitude toward his music ensured that Parker would clash with the changing priorities of the major label music business, and the label changes came quickly after the mid-1980s. This situation partly accounts for the remarkable number of compilation albums in Graham Parker's discography. Particularly unproductive was Parker's tenure at Atlantic Records, where he has said he was told to collaborate with other songwriters and to focus on "a big drum sound." Instead, Parker ended the deal and signed to RCA Records. He began producing his own recordings and stripping down his sound with The Mona Lisa's Sister, a success in the new "modern rock" format. The groundbreaking work gained the singer renewed critical attention for his followup albums. 

After the movingly personal 12 Haunted Episodes, his first release on an independent record label, Parker grew quiet in the late 1990s, but began an extraordinarily active period in 2001, with the UK rerelease of his early Rumour work, and with Deepcut to Nowhere, a penetrating collection of new songs that seemed intended to reflect comprehensively on the singer's life and aims.

The new work continued with 2004's Your Country, which was released on Chicago-based indie Bloodshot Records and, while presented as a flirtation with country music, had only marginally rootsier sound than Parker's norm. Following in 2005 was Songs Of No Consequence, an uptempo rock and roll collection quickly recorded with sometime backing band, the Figgs. A show from the ensuing tour with the Figgs broadcasted on FM radio became a live album in 2006. In March of 2007, a new full-length, Don't Tell Columbus is due, marking Parker's fourth album in three years. 

In addition to his records, Parker published a set of short stories, Carp Fishing on Valium, in June 2000. His second book, a novel, The Other Life of Brian, appeared in September 2003.

Rephidim was one of the places (or "stations") visited by the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt.

At Rephidim, the Israelites found no water to drink, and in their distress they blamed Moses for their troubles, to the point where Moses feared that they would stone him (Exodus 17:4). God commanded Moses to strike a certain "rock in Horeb," which caused a stream to flow from it, providing enough water for all of the people.

Afterwards, the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while encamped at Rephidim, but were defeated (Exodus 17:8-16). They were the "first of the nations" to make war against Israel (Numbers 24:20).

One proposal places Rephidim in the Wadi Feiran, near its junction with the Wadi esh-Sheikh. Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites advanced into the Sinai Wilderness (Exodus 19:1-2; Numbers 33:14-15), possibly marching through the two passes of the Wadi Solaf and the Wadi esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the er-Rahah plain (which would then be identified with the "Sinai Wilderness"), which is two miles long and about half a mile broad. See also Meribah.

The name "Rephidim" (Hebrew:         ) may mean supports.

Epimenides is a lunar crater that is located in the southwestern part of the Moon's near side, just to the east of the Hainzel crater formation. Just to the north and northeast is Lacus Timoris, a small lunar mare.

The outer rim of this crater is roughly circular, but uneven due to the irregular terrain in which it is located. The southern edge is distended where a smaller formation has overlapped the side. The interior floor is relatively level and featureless.

Satellite craters.
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Epimenides crater.

Friedrich Ludwig Abresch (29 December 1699, Homburg - 1782) was a Dutch philologist of German origins.

Born in Homburg, the reasons that led him to move to the Netherlands are uncertain. He visited the college in Herborn and the University of Utrecht. He was a scholar of Karl Andreas Duker and Arnold Drakenborch. However he followed rather the teachings of Tiberius Hemsterhuis and engaged in Greek literature as far as his work allowed this. 

In 1723 he was appointed co-rector, in 1725 rector in Middelburg. After the death of his first wife, he remarried a rich woman from Zwolle and willingly accepted the offer to take the local rectorate. He remained in office until his death in 1782, remaining lusty and hale all the time.

Nicholas Lyndhurst (born  20 April 1961 in Emsworth, Hampshire) is an English actor. 

A child student at Corona Stage Academy, he appeared in a succession of commercials and children's films in the early 1970s, and first gained national recognition at the age of seventeen in the sitcom Butterflies, in which he played the character Adam. He then played the teenage son of Norman Stanley 'Fletch' Fletcher in Going Straight before achieving stardom in the series Only Fools and Horses in which he played Rodney Trotter, the younger brother of the main character Del Boy. 

This programme started as a small comedy in 1981 and rapidly grew in popularity until it reached its peak in 1996 with its Christmas Day show in the UK. During his period, Lyndhurst also appeared in ITV's The Two of Us and The Piglet Files, as well as in a number of stage performances.

In 1993 he played the lead character of Gary Sparrow in science fiction sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart. At around the same time, he was also the face and voice on the TV and radio commercials for the telecommunications chain People's Phone.

In between 1997 and 1999 Nicholas Lyndhurst was the public face of the stationery chain store WH Smith, starring as all four members of a family in their adverts. He won a BAFTA for his acting in the adverts.

He recently appeared as Cruella De Vil's chauffeur, Reg Farnsworth at the Children's Party at the Palace in 2006.

Lyndhurst has returned to the BBC with his first new sitcom for thirteen years, After You've Gone in which he plays a divorced dad moving back into the marital home to look after his daughter (Danielle Harmer) and son (Ryan Sampson) with his mother-in-law, played by Celia Imrie, after his ex-wife goes to work as a recovery nurse on a third world disaster relief mission. 

He is married with a young son. Lyndhurst has a passion for outdoor activities, including flying aeroplanes, surfing and deep-sea diving.

Cantona is a relatively unknown archaeological site in Mexico. It is located in the state of Puebla, on the border with Veracruz, about an hour's drive from the city of Puebla and about an hour and a half from Xalapa, Veracruz.  Limited archaeological work has been done at the site, and only about 10% of the site can be seen.  Twenty four ballcourts have been documented at Cantona, as well as a number of small pyramids.  

Cantona is unusual among archaeological sites in Mexico as all of its architecture was built with dry-laid stones.  Mortar was not employed, and it is the weight of the stones that holds the architecture together.  

It is believed to have been a military city. However, there is still much to learn about Cantona.

<doc id="483974" title="Digital AMPS" nonfiltered="364" processed="362" dbindex="450366">

IS-54 and IS-136 are second-generation (2G) mobile phone systems, known as Digital AMPS (D-AMPS).  It is used throughout the Americas, particularly in the United States and Canada.  D-AMPS is considered end-of-life, and existing networks are in the process of being replaced by GSM/GPRS and CDMA2000 technologies.  

Although this system is most often referred to as TDMA,  this name is based on the acronym for time division multiple access, a common multiple access technique which is used by multiple protocols, including GSM, as well as in IS-54 and IS-136. 
The two different uses of this term can be confusing.  TDMA (the technique) is also used in the GSM standard.  However, TDMA (the standard, i.e. IS-136) has been competing against GSM and systems based on Code division multiple access (CDMA) for adoption by the network carriers, although it is now being phased out in favor of GSM technology.

D-AMPS uses existing AMPS channels and allows for smooth transition between digital and analog systems in the same area.  Capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 kHz channel pair into three time slots (hence time division) and digitally compressing the voice data, yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell.  A digital system also made calls more secure because analog scanners could not access digital signals.  Calls were encrypted, although the algorithm used (CMEA) was later found to be weak. 

IS-136 added a number of features to the original IS-54 specification, including text messaging, circuit switched data (CSD), and an improved compression protocol.  SMS and CSD were both available as part of the GSM protocol, and IS-136 implemented them in a nearly identical fashion.

Large IS-136 networks include Cingular Wireless and U.S. Cellular in the United States, and Rogers Wireless in Canada.  Cingular (who purchased AT&T Wireless in October 2004) and Rogers Wireless have upgraded their existing IS-136 networks to GSM/GPRS, while US Cellular is migrating most of their network to CDMA2000.  Rogers Wireless removed all 1900 MHz IS-136 in 2003, and is slowly doing the same with their 800 MHz spectrum as the equipment fails.  It is not unusual for a Rogers D-AMPS customer to have coverage in a specific location one day, and then none in that same area the next.  Rogers will  deactivate their IS-136 network (along with AMPS) in May 2007.

IS-54 is the first mobile communication system which had provision for security, and the first to employ TDMA technology.
Introduction.

IS-54 stands for Interim Standard-54, which is a mobile communication standard employing digital technology. Standards, in general establish the compatibility and performance requirements for technology. Standards assist manufacturers, service providers, and end users to build buy and use products that provide mutually agreed upon features, functionality, and performance. Standards also facilitate the interoperability of products built by different manufacturers. With standards, the service provider and end user have more choices in products than would otherwise be available, and likewise manufacturers have greater access to market than otherwise.

IS-54 was standardized by Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) and Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) together. It later became an American National Standard when it got approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). When an interim standard becomes an American National Standard, the IS designator is dropped. The ANSI designation of IS-54 is ANSI/TIA/EIA-627, but this standard is still popularly referred to as IS-54.

IS-54 maintains compatibility with Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) in many ways. It is a digital extension of AMPS and so it is also quite widely known as Digital AMPS (D-AMPS). Another name for IS-54 is United States Digital Cellular (USDC). But sometimes D-AMPS and USDC also refers to the other prominent interim standard IS-136.

History.
                                     
The evolution of mobile communication has been almost wholly in 3 different geographic regions. The standards that were born in these regions were quite independent. The 3 regions are North America, Europe and Japan. The earlier mobile or wireless technologies were wholly analog and are collectively known as 1st Generation (1G) technologies. In Japan, the 1G standards were Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the high capacity version of it (Hicap). The European systems were not common and the  European Union  viewpoint that is visible in the later technologies was absent. Various 1G standards that were in use in Europe include C-Netz (in Germany and Austria), Comviq (in Sweden), Nordic Mobile Telephones/450 (NMT450), NMT900 (both in Nordic countries), NMT-F (French version of NMT900), Radiocom 2000 (RC2000)(in France), Total Access Communication System(TACS)(in the United Kingdom). North American standards were Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) and Narrow-band AMPS (N-AMPS).

Out of the 1G standards the most successful was the AMPS system. Despite the Nordic countries cooperation, the European intellect got divided to various standards and the Japanese standards didn t get much attention. Developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s and first used commercially in the United States in 1983, AMPS operates in the 800 and 1900 MHz band in the United States and is the most widely distributed analog cellular standard. AMPS was undoubtedly, the leader of the 1G mobile communication systems. The success of AMPS kicked start the mobile age in the North America. 

The markets showed an increasing demand because it had higher capacity and mobility than the then existing mobile communication standards. For instance, the Bell Labs system in the 1970s could carry only 12 calls at a time throughout all of New York City. AMPS used Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA which meant each cell site would transmit on different frequencies, allowing many cell sites to be built near each other. 

However, AMPS had many disadvantages too. Primarily, it didn t have the potential to support the increasing demand for mobile communication usage. Each cell site did not have much capacity for carrying higher numbers of calls. It also had a poor security system which allowed people to steal a phone's serial code to use for making illegal calls. All of these triggered  the search for a more capable system.

The quest resulted in IS-54, the first American 2G standard. In March 1990, the North American cellular network incorporated the IS-54B standard, the first North American dual mode digital cellular standard. This standard won over Motorola's Narrowband AMPS or N-AMPS, an analog scheme that increased capacity by cutting down voice channels from 30 kHz to 10 kHz. IS-54, on the other hand, increased capacity by digital means using TDMA, time division multiple access, protocols. This method separates calls by time, placing parts of individual conversations on the same frequency, one after the next. TDMA tripled call capacity.

Using IS-54, a cellular carrier could convert any of its systems' analog voice channels to digital. A dual mode phone uses digital channels where available and defaults to regular AMPS where they are not. IS-54 was, in fact, backward compatible with analog cellular and indeed co-exists on the same radio channels as AMPS. No analog customers were left behind; they simply couldn't access IS-54's new features. IS-54 also supported authentication, a help in preventing fraud.

Technology Specifications.
                                      
IS-54 employs the same 30 kHz channel spacing and frequency bands (824-849 and 869-894 MHz) as AMPS. Capacity was increased over the preceding analog design by dividing each 30 kHz channel pair into three time slots and digitally compressing the voice data, yielding three times the call capacity in a single cell. A digital system also made calls more secure because analog scanners could not access digital signals. 

The IS-54 standard specifies 84 control channels, 42 of which are shared with AMPS. To maintain compatibility with the existing AMPS cellular telephone system, the primary forward and reverse control channels in IS-54 cellular systems use the same signaling techniques and modulation scheme (binary FSK) as AMPS. An AMPS/IS-54 infrastructure can support use of either analog AMPS phones or D-AMPS phones.

The access method used for IS-54 is Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), which was the first U.S. digital standard to be developed. It was adopted by the TIA in 1992. TDMA subdivides each of the 30 kHz AMPS channels into 3 full-rate TDMA channels, each of which is capable of supporting a single voice call. Later, each of these full-rate channels was further sub-divided into two half-rate channels, each of which, with the necessary coding and compression, could also support a voice call. Thus, TDMA could provide 3 to 6 times the capacity of AMPS traffic channels. Time Division Multiple Access or TDMA was initially defined by the IS-54 standard and is now specified in the IS-13x series of specifications of the EIA/TIA.

The channel transmission bit rate for digitally modulating the carrier is 48.6 kbit/s. Each frame has six time slots of 6.67-ms duration. Each time slot carries 324 bits of information, of which 260 bits are for the 13-kbit/s full-rate traffic data. The other 64 bits are overhead; 28 of these are for synchronization, and they contain a specific bit sequence known by all receivers to establish frame alignment. Also, as with GSM, the known sequence acts as a training pattern to initialize an adaptive equalizer.

The IS-54 system has different synchronization sequences for each of the six time slots making up the frame, thereby allowing each receiver to synchronize to its own preassigned time slots. An additional 12 bits in every time slot are for the SACCH (i.e., system control information). The digital verification color code (DVCC) is the equivalent of the supervisory audio tone used in the AMPS system. There are 256 different 8-bit color codes, which are protected by a (12, 8, 3) Hamming code. Each base station has its own preassigned color code, so any incoming interfering signals from distant cells can be ignored.

The modulation scheme for IS-54 is 7C/4 differential quaternary phase shift keying (DQPSK), otherwise known as differential 7t/4 4-PSK or  /4 DQPSK. This technique allows a bit rate of 48.6 kbit/s with 30 kHz channel spacing, to give a bandwidth efficiency of 1.62 b/s/Hz. This value is 20% better than GSM. The major disadvantage with this type of linear modulation method is the power inefficiency, which translates into a heavier hand-held portable and, even more inconvenient, a shorter time between battery recharges.

IS-54 security features is also a matter of interest as it was the first standard to specify some security measures. IS-54 uses the CAVE (Cellular Authentication, Voice Privacy and Encryption) algorithm for authentication and the CMEA (Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm) for encryption.

The technical specifications can be summarized as below:


Call Processing.
A conversation's data bits makes up the DATA field. Six slots make up a complete IS-54 frame. DATA in slots 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6 make up a voice circuit. DVCC stands for digital verification color code, arcane terminology for a unique 8-bit code value assigned to each cell. G means guard time, the period between each time slot. RSVD stands for reserved. SYNC represents synchronization, a critical TDMA data field. Each slot in every frame must be synchronized against all others and a master clock for everything to work.

Time slots for the mobile-to-base direction are constructed differently from the base-to-mobile direction. They essentially carry the same information but are arranged differently. Notice that the mobile-to-base direction has a 6-bit ramp time to enable its transmitter time to get up to full power, and a 6-bit guard band during which nothing is transmitted. These 12 extra bits in the base-to-mobile direction are reserved for future use.

Once a call comes in the mobile switches to a different pair of frequencies; a voice radio channel which the system carrier has made analog or digital. This pair carries the call. If an IS-54 signal is detected it gets assigned a digital traffic channel if one is available. The fast associated channel or FACCH performs handoffs during the call, with no need for the mobile to go back to the control channel. In case of high noise FACCH, embedded within the digital traffic channel overrides the voice payload, degrading speech quality to convey control information. The purpose is to maintain connectivity. The slow associated control channel or SACCH does not perform handoffs but conveys things like signal strength information to the base station.

The IS-54 speech coder uses the technique called vector sum excited linear prediction (VSELP) coding. This is a special type of speech coder within a large class known as code-excited linear prediction (CELP) coders. The speech coding rate of 7.95 kbit/s achieves a reconstructed speech quality similar to that of the analog AMPS system using frequency modulation. The 7.95-kbit/s signal is then passed through a channel coder that loads the bit rate up to 13 kbit/s. The new half-rate coding standard reduces the overall bit rate for each call to 6.5 kbit/s, and should provide comparable quality to the 13-kbit/s rate. This half-rate gives a channel capacity six times that of analog AMPS.

System Example.

The discussion of a communication system won t be complete without the explanation of a system example. A dual-mode cellular phone as specified by the IS-54 standard is explained. A dual-mode phone is capable of operating in an analog-only cell or a dual-mode cell. Both the transmitter and the receiver support both analog FM and digital time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. Digital transmission is preferred, so when a cellular system has digital capability, the mobile unit is assigned a digital channel first. If no digital channels are available, the cellular system will assign an analog channel. The transmitter converts the audio signal to a radio frequency (RF), and the receiver converts an RF signal to an audio signal. The antenna focuses and converts RF energy for reception and transmission into free space. The control panel serves as an input/output mechanism for the end user; it supports a keypad, a display, a microphone, and a speaker. The coordinator synchronizes the transmission and receives functions of the mobile unit.
A dual-mode cellular phone consists of the following:
Transmitter ;
Antenna assembly;
Receiver;
Control panel ;
Coordinator;

Successor Technologies.
By 1993 American cellular was again running out of capacity, despite a wide movement to IS-54. The American cellular business continued booming. Subscribers grew from one and a half million customers in 1988 to more than thirteen million subscribers in 1993. Room existed for other technologies to cater to the growing market. The technologies that followed IS-54 stuck to the digital backbone laid down by it.

IS-136.
A pragmatic effort was launched to improve IS-54 that eventually added an extra channel to the IS-54 hybrid design. Unlike IS-54, IS-136 utilizes time division multiplexing for both voice and control channel transmissions. Digital control channel allows residential and in-building coverage, dramatically increased battery standby time, several messaging applications, over the air activation and expanded data applications. IS-136 systems needed to support millions of AMPS phones, most of which were designed and manufactured before IS-54 and IS-136 were considered. IS-136 added a number of features to the original IS-54 specification, including text messaging, circuit switched data (CSD), and an improved compression protocol. IS-136 TDMA traffic channels use  /4-DQPSK modulation at a 24.3-kbaud channel rate and gives an effective 48.6 kbit/s data rate across the six time slots comprising one frame in the 30 kHz channel.

Lechmere (pronounced "leech-meer", sometimes described as Lechmere's) was a retail store chain in New England, which closed in 1997. 

History.
Lechmere primarily focused on sales of electronics and appliances, including home goods and exercise equipment.

The original Lechmere Harness Shop in Lechmere Square (the store was named after the square) was bought by Abraham Cohen in 1913, who converted it into a tire store. Appliances were added in 1948. The second store opened in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1965, and Lechmere became a chain.

Sale To Dayton Hudson.
In 1968, the Cohen family sold the stores to Dayton Hudson Corp. (who later changed their name to Target Corporation in 2000).

Lechmere languished under Dayton Hudson's corporate guidance until 1980, when C. George Scala was named CEO.  Scala revamped the stores offerings, from an at times arcane and exotic selection of goods (from tires to snake meat), to a core grouping which included houseware, appliances, sporting goods, electronics, and music.  Lechmere offered a wide and deep selection of these products.  The stores carried telephones for example, ranging from the inexpensive to the top of the line, but also, offered customers choices in every price range.  

Lechmere was almost a "Mall" within a Mall, with its home electronics department able to compete product for product with Tweeter, its houseware department offering as much, if not more, than Lechter's (a retailer who has since closed its doors), its footwear department could compete with Foot Locker, and its music department was as large and varied as Recordtown's (another retailing ghost).

"Our customers don't want cheap steak, they want steak cheap!" was a familiar saying.  While Lechmere did not offer "rock bottom" pricing, it did offer competitive pricing, a no hassle return policy, very knowledgable sales associates, colorful and informative signing in store, as well as its famous Lechmere Sunday circular.  The stores were large, clean, bright, and uncluttered.  

This was to be the heyday of the company, which also saw an increase in retailing excellence with the addition of Frank G. Fellicella as Executive Vice President of Stores, who would later become CEO of a large home improvement company.

Split From Dayton Hudson.
In 1989, the company's management, with the help of a local investment firm, Berkshire Partners, and the Boston-based Mall developers Steve Karp and Steve Wiener, bought the chain from Dayton Hudson's.  The sale was the second largest leveraged buyout of the year.  Lechmere's 29 stores fetched only book value of $234 million, much less than early estimates of $350 million.  

A result of the sale was the closing of the southeast region, and the stores located there.  The cost of running essentially two companies (one in New England, and one in the deep southeast) was too costly for the now privately owned venture.

Then, in the early 1990s, C. George Scala retired and was replaced by J. Kent Flemmerfelt, a veteran Sears merchant. Things started to turn sour--with several rounds of layoffs.

Montgomery Ward.
In March 1994 Berkshire Partners sold Lechmere to Montgomery Ward Holdings in a more than $200 million deal. Berkshire acquired the business in 1989 and according to Berkshire Partner Richard Lubin, the firm initially wanted to take the business public. 

He said at the time, "As we learned about the Montgomery Ward strategy, we realized this was a buyer that could make a very attractive offer, an offer that we thought was above what we viewed our IPO offering would have been." In 1993, Lechmere had sales of more than $800 million, through 24 stores in the New England area. 

At the time of purchase, Lechmere had 28 stores and grew to 33 with the introduction of HomeImage by Lechmere stores that opened in August of 1996.

However, it wasn't long after that the business press was calling Montgomery Ward's purchase of Lechmere a disaster, and less than five years after the acquisition, the company was forced to liquidate Lechmere's assets. In 2000, Montgomery Ward itself was forced into bankruptcy protection amid competition from the likes of Wal-Mart and Target, and the company eventually shuttered its stores and closed after 128 years in business.

Closure.
On August 1, 1997, Montgomery Ward announced that all Lechmere stores were to be closed as part of their bankruptcy reorganization. At the time of the chain's closing, 27 stores remained open, including 20 in New England, 12 of which were in Massachusetts. All six HomeImage by Lechmere were also closed at that time.

November 8, 1997 was the last day of business for all locations.

Thomas (Tom) O'Dell is the host of a satellite television shopping show, sometimes referred to as a network, dedicated to selling fine cutlery and assorted medieval bladed weaponry. 'Cutlery Corner Network', sometimes referred to as Knife Show is featured on cable on Dish Network, DirecTV (Channel 227) and i in the United States. However, due to contract variations, the timeslot in which Cutlery Corner has previously aired on it has been replaced with old movies.

Though he is not directly involved with the show, Tom is also a co-host of Coin Country, a similar type of show selling coins. Before these two shows, he worked on various knife shows, such as the Knife Collectors Show along with Shawn Leflar on the Shop at Home network.

On Cutlery Corner, Tom is assisted on the show by one of two additional hosts, Sheila Travis or Todd Boone (who also works on Shop at Home), demonstrating swords, katanas, bowies and many decorative knives. Tom is famous for being highly enthusiastic about his work. Many people tune into his late-night infomercials to simply be entertained by him.

One of O'Dell's famous terms is "Biggens" (or Bigguns) used to describe the large knives and swords that he sells.

O'Dell is also known for saying "We, uh, may need emergency surgery in the studio" on a famous online clip in which a former assistant of his, Shawn Leflar, stabs himself with a practice katana.  This clip has been featured on VH1's Web Junk 20. Clips have also been featured from broadcasts of Cutlery Corner on Jimmy Kimmel Live. On January 4, 2007, O'Dell was a guest on Kimmel's show, showing off some of his knives and sharing his experiences.

At first the injury was believed to be accidental, but the shooter's parents gave information that prompted interest. Investigations revealed that the uninjured 14 year old was the leader of the plot, which included shootings and the use of explosives. Multiple bomb threaths had been made the previous school year. Two thirteen year olds  a boy and a girl  had also been at the house earlier that day and were also involved in the plot. The shooter was expelled, and the thirteen year olds suspended. The shooter was charged with third-degree assault and unlawful possession of a firearm.

M-24, (also known as Lapeer Rd for a portion of the route) is a highway that extends 74.3 miles (119 km) through southeastern Michigan, from Auburn Hills (at an interchange with I-75) to Unionville (where it merges with M-25.  While the M-24 designation is similar to that of US 24 which has a northern terminus located only a few miles from the southern terminus of M-24, M-24 was never part of US 24. 

Route.
The section of M-24 from its southern terminus in Auburn Hills north to the village of Oxford is one of the busiest stretches of road in the state in terms of vehicle traffic per number of lanes.  The road is a standard Michigan expressway design, with at-grade intersections, traffic signals, and Michigan Lefts.  This continues a few miles north of Oxford, where the highway becomes a two-lane highway (as of 2006 construction projects are under way to widen the road to Lapeer.) 

Heading north, M-24 passes through Lake Orion, Oxford, Metamora and Lapeer. Very close to its southern terminus is the Palace of Auburn Hills, home of the NBA's Detroit Pistons. 

Prior to an early 2000's extension, M-24 ended at M-81 in Caro, MI; now it continues up to M-25 in Unionville.

Interstate junctions.
M-24 begins a hundred feet south of an overpass that is part of a double trumpet interchange with I-75 in Auburn Hills.  The interchange also connects with an entrance into the Palace of Auburn Hills and a variety of electronic signs are contained in the area to indicate the status of access to the entrance.  The roadway is a continuation of BL I-75 that travels through Pontiac.

M-24 also intersects I-69 on the south side of Lapeer.

For the comedy writer and actor, see Paul Mooney.;


Paul Muni (MYOO-nee) (September 22, 1895   August 25, 1967) was an Academy Award-winning and Tony Award-winning versatile actor from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Early life and career.
He was born Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund to a Jewish family in Lviv, Galicja, an ethnically Polish part of the then-Austro-Hungarian Empire, which became Lvov, Ukraine (known as Lviv since the 1990s). 

His family emigrated to the United States in 1902. Both of Muni's parents were actors with the Yiddish theater, so it was only natural that he would join them on stage. He made his stage debut at age twelve. In a stage quirk, Muni played an 80-year-old man as his first role. It was an appropriate beginning for an actor who loved wearing elaborate costumes and assuming accents in his film career. During his time in Yiddish theater, he was known as Moony Weisenfreund. He was quickly recognized by Maurice Schwartz, who signed him up with his Yiddish Art Theater. Edward G. Robinson and Paul Muni were cousins to Charles M Fritz who was a notable actor and manager of The Little Red
Theater in Northport, Long Island, New York during the depression.

A 1925 New York Times article singled out his and Sam Kasten's performances at the People's Theater as among the highlights of that year's Yiddish theater season, describing them as second only to Ludwig Satz.

Broadway and Hollywood.
Muni was 29 when he began acting on Broadway in 1924. His first role, that of an elderly Jewish man in the play We Americans, was written by playwright Sam Harris; it was also the first time that he ever acted in English. 

He was signed by Fox three years later, in 1929, and received an Oscar nomination for his first film The Valiant. However, he was unhappy with the roles and decided to return to Broadway. 

In 1932, Paul Muni returned to Hollywood to star in such harrowing pre-Code films as Scarface and I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. He received a second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for the latter film. Warner Brothers recognized his considerable talent and signed a long-term contract with him. 

He went on to receive a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for The Life of Emile Zola (1937) and to win the Academy Award for The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936).

In the ensuing years until his retirement in 1959, he spent his time acting on film and stage. He was widely recognized as a talented if eccentric individual. He would go into a rage whenever anyone wore red, but at the same time he could often be found between sessions relaxing with his violin. Over the years, he also became increasingly dependent on his wife, Bella, who terrified directors by forcing them to redo scenes that did not meet her satisfaction. 

After several failed projects, Muni was nominated for a Tony Award in 1955 for the role of Henry Drummond in the play Inherit the Wind.

He was becoming increasingly infirm, however, and soon after receiving his final Academy Award nomination for The Last Angry Man (1959), he retired from acting. 

Muni died in Montecito, California at aged 71, survived by his wife.

In number theory, a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function f(n) of the positive integer n with the property that f(1) = 1 and whenever
a and b are coprime, then
f(ab) = f(a) f(b).

An arithmetic function f(n) is said to be completely (totally) multiplicative if f(1) = 1 and f(ab) = f(a) f(b) holds for all positive integers a and b, even when they are not coprime. 

Outside number theory, the term multiplicative is usually used for functions with the property f(ab) = f(a) f(b) for all arguments a and b; this requires either f(1) = 1,  or f(a) = 0 for all a except a = 1.  This article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions.

 Examples .

Examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory, such as: 
 (n): Euler's totient function , counting the positive integers coprime to (but not bigger than) n ;
 (n): the Möbius function, related to the number of prime factors of square-free numbers;
 gcd(n,k): the greatest common divisor of n and k, where k is a fixed integer.
 d(n): the number of positive divisors of n, ;
 (n): the sum of all the positive divisors of n,
 k(n): the divisor function, which is the sum of the k-th powers of all the positive divisors of n (where k may be any complex number). In special cases we have;
 0(n) = d(n) and;
 1(n) = (n),
 1(n): the constant function, defined by 1(n) = 1 (completely multiplicative);
  the indicator function of the set  of squares (or cubes, or fourth powers, etc.);
 Id(n): identity function, defined by Id(n) = n (completely multiplicative);
 Idk(n): the power functions, defined by Idk(n) = nk for any natural (or even complex) number k (completely multiplicative). As special cases we have;
 Id0(n) = 1(n) and;
 Id1(n) = Id(n),
 (n): the function defined by (n) = 1 if n = 1 and = 0 if n > 1, sometimes called multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function; sometimes written as u(n), not to be confused with (n) (completely multiplicative).
 (n/p), the Legendre symbol, where p is a fixed prime number (completely multiplicative).
 (n): the Liouville function, related to the number of prime factors dividing n (completely multiplicative).
 (n), defined by (n)=(-1)(n), where the additive function (n) is the number of distinct primes dividing n.
 All Dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions.

An example of a non-multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r2(n) - the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers, positive, negative, or zero, where in counting the number of ways, reversal of order is allowed. For example:

1 = 12 + 02 = (-1)2 + 02 = 02 + 12 = 02 + (-1)2;

and therefore r2(1) = 4   1. This shows that the function is not multiplicative. However, r2(n)/4 is multiplicative.

In the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, sequences of values of a multiplicative function have the keyword "mult".

See arithmetic function for some other examples of non-multiplicative functions.

 Properties .

A multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers, a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Thus, if n is a product of powers of distinct primes, say n = pa qb ..., then 
f(n) = f(pa) f(qb) ...

This property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation, as in the following examples for n = 144 = 24 · 32:
 d(144) = 0(144) = 0(24)0(32) = (10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160)(10 + 30 + 90) = 5 · 3 = 15,
 (144) = 1(144) = 1(24)1(32) = (11 + 21 + 41 + 81 + 161)(11 + 31 + 91) = 31 · 13 = 403,
 *(144) = *(24)*(32) = (11 + 161)(11 + 91) = 17 · 10 = 170.

Similarly, we have:

(144)=(24)(32) = 8 · 6 = 48;

In general, if f(n) is a multiplicative function and a, b are any two positive integers, then
f(a) · f(b) = f(gcd(a,b)) · f(lcm(a,b)).

Every completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers.

 Convolution .

If f and g are two multiplicative functions, one defines a new multiplicative function f * g, the Dirichlet convolution of f and g, by
;
where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n. 
With this operation, the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group; the identity element is .

Relations among the multiplicative functions discussed above include:

  * 1 =  (the Möbius inversion formula);
 ( Idk) * Idk =  (generalized Möbius inversion);
  * 1 = Id;
 d = 1 * 1;
  = Id * 1 =  * d;
 k = Idk * 1 ;
 Id =  * 1 =  * ;
 Idk = k * ;

The Dirichlet convolution can be defined for general arithmetic functions, and yields a ring structure, the Dirichlet ring.

 Proving convolution identities .

There is a very useful theorem for proving convolution identities, which says that if f, g and h are multiplicative, and one wants to prove that
;
then it suffices to prove it for powers of primes.

The proof of this theorem is by mathematical induction on the number of distinct prime factors of n. The base case of the induction is that n has just one prime factor, in which case
;
because we assumed that it holds for powers of primes.

For the induction step, let


Start with
;
and split the set of divisors of n into those that are coprime to p, and those that are not:

Using the fact that f and g are multiplicative, this becomes


Now  has one fewer prime factor than , 
so by the induction hypothesis, we have
,
which yields
;
or
;
because we assumed the convolution holds for powers of primes, and by multiplicativity of h. QED.

We may now prove some convolution identities of multiplicative functions by verifying that they hold for powers of primes.

First example: Moebius inversion.

We have
;
This certainly holds for powers  of primes, where the left evaluates to
;
This proves the Moebius inversion formula, through
;

Second example: the classic totient identity.

We show that
;
The left is


Third example: the square of the divisor function.

We show that
;
where  is the indicator function of the set of naturals that are squares.

The right is


The left is


Now there are two cases, depending on whether v is even or odd.
Let  where . This gives
;
Next let  where . This in turn gives
;

Fourth example: an exotic identity.

Here we show that
;

The left is


Once more there are two cases. Let  where .
We obtain

Furthermore, when  where  we find

The Colvin Center is a student recreation center at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The state-of-the-art center offers 240,000 square feet of recreational space. The Colvin Center is a popular destination for many OSU students, thanks to the wide array of sports and physical activities available at the facility and serves an average of 4,000 students a day. Admission to the Colvin Center is free to Oklahoma State students, although every OSU student pays a small fee along with their tuition towards maintenance of the center.

The Colvin Center was originally completed on March 1, 1969, at a cost of almost $3 million. In 1999, student government representatives had become concerned that the aging Colvin Center was becoming increasingly outdated and incapable of meeting the needs of a much larger student body. This movement would later give way to a massive two-year, $23 million renovation and expansion project that was completed in July 2004. The project gave the Colvin Center approximately 180,000 square feet of completely new or renovated area, including five new gyms (bringing the total number to eleven) and a golf center with three driving-range practice nets, a practice putting green and two golf simulators. Other amenities include an indoor pool and outdoor pool, dance studios, 35-foot climbing wall, indoor jogging tracks, racquetball courts, and cardio and fitness equipment. The weight and fitness-training areas alone have more than tripled in size from 9,000 to more than 30,000 square feet with $600,000 of new equipment.

In 2005, the Colvin Center was named as one of the top six collegiate sports centers in the United States by the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association.

65daysofstatic (also known by the abbreviations 65dos, 65days, or simply 65) are an instrumental math rock and post-rock band from Sheffield, England. Their debut album, The Fall of Math, was released to critical acclaim and they have released a second album, One Time For All Time, which has been well received.

The band intersperses heavy, progressive, guitar-driven instrumental sections with live drums and off-beat sampled drums akin to those of Aphex Twin. Their albums, as a result, maintain a distinctively gritty, almost industrial feel.

History.
The band was originally formed in 2001 as a three-piece, consisting of Joe Shrewsbury, Paul Wolinski, and Iain Armstrong. One of the several stories the band has told as to the origin of their name is that they formed to provide the soundtrack for the unreleased and little known John Carpenter film Stealth Bomber starring Kurt Russell. The film was set over '65 Days of Static' a period of time after some unknown global breakdown in communications and infrastructure, from which the band supposedly took their name. 

The lineup of the band has changed significantly since its initial formation. Armstrong left in May 2003, and later went on to form a new band, Actionier. Feedle joined for a brief period and played a part in writing the band's first single from The Fall of Math, "Retreat! Retreat!". By the end of 2003 Rob Jones (drums) and Gareth Hughes (bass) had been recruited, increasing the band to four members. Gareth left around the time of the release of their debut album The Fall of Math, and is currently in the band Saving:Mitsuko. Simon Wright took over on bass duties.

In 2005 they remixed Alkaline Trio's single "Burn" from the album Crimson. The track appears on one 7" vinyl out of a set of 2. In the same year, the band also remixed "...Spooks the Horse," a track by Youthmovie Soundtrack Strategies, for inclusion on the reissue of their debut album, Hurrah! Another Year, Surely This One Will Be Better Than The Last; The Inexorable March Of Progress Will Lead Us All To Happiness.

65daysofstatic are currently working on their as yet untitled third album, which will be released on 30th April 2007. A single will be released three weeks before this on 9th April .

Live.
The band have repeatedly stated that they love playing live. Towards the end of 2005, in a mailout to subscribers of their newsletter, they said that they were "a little disappointed" to have only played 91 shows in that year . They have received critical acclaim from independent music websites, such as Drowned in Sound, for their live shows .

In 2006, they played to their biggest crowd yet at that year's Summer Sonic festival in Japan, alongside such bands as Metallica, Lostprophets, Linkin Park and Deftones. 2006 also saw their first European tour, playing in Belgium, Holland, Germany, Italy and France.

A bug-out vehicle (BOV) is a vehicle that the owner keeps prepared in the event of the need for an emergency evacuation.  Typically a BOV is equipped with a variation on the bug-out bag that includes additional automotive supplies, clothing, food and water.  Survivalists tend to favor four wheel drive trucks and SUVs.  Evacuations in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita stimulated interest in the use of hybrid cars and dual-sport or on/off road touring motorcycles as BOVs due to the massive traffic jams and fuel shortages.

Diboko means clan names in Southern Africa. 
Description.
In the Southern African Sesotho speaking groups' (Sesotho, Setswana, and Sepedi) traditions, the different tribes identify themselves with certain clans. The groups believe in the existence of the "Invisible One". Ad legend has it, they came out of a marsh called "Nswanatsatsi" which means "the place from where the sun emerges". It was from that marsh that each clan was assigned a totem. Each totem is symbolized by an animal, one that is dignified. Following is a list of several clans and their totems.

Clan name from totem.

(cf. Matsela and Moletsane 1993:7):

 Bakwena             -               Kwena (crocodile);

 Bafokeng            -               Phoka (dew), morara (wild vine), mmutla (rabbit);

 Batloung            -               Tlou (elephant);

 Batshweneng         -               Tshwene (baboon);

 Bakubung            -               Kubu (hippopotamus);

 Baphuthing          -               Phuthi (duiker), lejwe (stone);

 Bafula-kolobeng     -               Kolobe (wild pig);

 Bahlaping           -               Tlhapi (fish);

 Banareng            -               Nare (buffalo);

 Bataung         -               Tau (lion);

Explanation.
It is worth noticing that the selection of these animals is either one of two things or both: the wildness of these animals and how dignified they seem to the group. This was done to symbolize Molimo oa Khale (God of the Old)   the "Invisible One". It is because of this these totems are sacred.

In the meditation of the spirits of the deceased, they are also believed to give guidance and direction in the groups' under takings and dangers. Unity in this group of people still exists, although the practicing of rituals is not as strict as it used to be. The practicing of different rituals is specific to a clan: all rituals   from marriages, to circumcision, to births and burials. This also happens to be one of the ways in which the clan names are preserved. Another is the naming of children after their predecessors   this was to make sure that the names of each clan are commemorated and kept within each family in each tribe. Basically, it is keeping the clan intact. The Sesotho name for it is "theellano"   naming a child after their grandparents or great-grandparents. 

A further important way of keeping the clans in tact was reciting the clan's Seboko (singular form of Diboko). I quote Mr. Raletshabisa Motale, from the village Dikhelekeng, in Butha-Buthe, Lesotho, who has much knowledge of Basotho culture, makes the following verbal addition on the reason behind the need for recitations:

"The recitation of the Seboko(Clan Name) means an identification of a person, a self-explanation according to the one's family from which one descends."

Switching from one Seboko to the other is not an easy task. It only occurred in extreme cases where, for example, a person had to change his identity because he had to flee into another family in a different clan. Another example is when a woman  married. An offering had to be made to the Badimo (the spirits of the deceased) and then an acceptance by the Badimo would be given to the one who is switching families. 

The reason there are so many clan names is because of the splitting up of groups. Some people wanted independence, and some violated the law so they were forced out.

<doc id="655978" title="Skitty" nonfiltered="389" processed="386" dbindex="450391">


 are one of the  fictional species of Pokémon creatures from the multi-billion-dollar Pokémon media franchise   a collection of video games, anime, manga, books, trading cards and other media created by Satoshi Tajiri. The purpose of Skitty in the games, anime and manga, as with all other Pokémon, is to battle both wild Pokémon, untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments, and tamed Pokémon owned by Pokémon trainers.

The name Skitty is a portmanteau of the words skittish and kitty.

Biology.
Skitty is a Pokémon that is considered cute even by its Pokédex definition. According to the Pokédex, it also loves to play with moving objects, just like Meowth. Because of this, it often chases its own tail until it is dizzy. However, Skitty is more like Clefairy due to rarity, pink color and its means of evolution. Its appearance is described by the following: each ear is split into three points, its tail starts skinny, followed by a sausage shape and ending with three cherry-like points. Its body is little and its paws are stumpy. Unlike Meowth, who lacks a visible nose, Skitty has a tiny nose that looks like a dot and squinty eyes.

Skitty are unique Pokémon, as they are the only species of Pokémon to naturally learn the move 'Assist', which randomly picks a move off the other Pokémon from your party and attacks with it. However, there are Pokémon which can have 'Assist' bred into them, like Meowth.( boy skitty female meowth)

Skitty might be the cutest Pokemon of all. Even Team rocket's Meowth couldn't resist the Kitten Pokemon's charms. Skitty loves to chase its tail-and anything else that moves-making it a very popular pet. Pronunciation: SKIT-tee Height: 2'0" Wheight: 24 lbs Possible moves: growl, tackle, tail whip, attract, sing, double slap, assist, charm, faint attack, covet, heal bell, double edge Evolves: with a moon stone to Declatty Type: normal region/regions: Hoenn

Characteristics.
Skitty has the habit of becoming fascinated by moving objects and chasing them around. This Pokémon is known to chase after its own tail and becomes dizzy. In the wild, this Pokémon lives in holes in the trees of forests. It is very popular as a pet because of its adorable looks. A Skitty's adorably cute behaviour makes it highly popular. In battle, it makes its tail puff out. It threatens foes with a sharp growl. It is said to be difficult to earn its trust. However, it is extremely popular for its cute looks and behavior.

In the video games.
Skitty can only be found on Route 116, east of Rustboro City, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, and they appear rarely. Rustboro is also the first place players actually see Skitty because one of the minor NPCs has it in her house as a pet. However, after the Elite Four is beaten in the game, it is possible to find a news flash on TV saying Skitty is temporalily more common.  Skitty is also one of the sixteen starters in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games. It evolves into Delcatty with the use of a Moon Stone.

Skitty has two abilities, the first is Cute Charm, which makes the opposite gender Pokémon infantuated when doing a physical contact with Skitty. The ability is introduced from Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire, while the second ability, Normal Skin, is introduced in Pokemon Pearl and Diamond. It makes all of Skitty's attacks become Normal-type. Both of the abilities are also possessed by its evolved form, Delcatty.

An egg containing a Skitty that knows Pay Day can be obtained from Pokémon Box. It can be obtained by storing 500 Pokémon from one game in the box. Before that, Pay Day was an exclusive move, only learnable by Meowth and Persian, but also by Hoppip by breeding.

In the Anime.
In the Pokémon anime, May has a Skitty that she uses for Pokémon Contests. It can juggle and perform a variety of attacks, for which it also is useful in battle, when it is not chasing its own tail. May's Skitty (like Jessie's  Wobbuffet and Misty's Psyduck) has a knack for coming out of its Poké Ball at some inappropriate moments, which may make May's opponent think it's her next battle Pokémon.

In the Pokémon Chronicles episode #323 "A Little Skitty" , Meowth falls in love with a female Skitty that's sleeping on a balcony and tries to impress her with flowers, songs, etc. However, a runaway Azurill always ruins the moment.

In the Manga.
In Pokémon Adventures, Ruby had a Skitty named Coco (derived from its Japanese name, Eneko) which was his staple Pokémon for Cute Contests. Coco evolved in Granite Cave when she accidentally touched a Moon Stone that was hanging on Steven's belt.

Other Properties.
Skitty has appeared on a few TCG cards in the EX series, its debut was in the EX:Ruby/Sapphire set.

Somewhere In The Sun... Best Of The Dream Academy is a compilation album released by The Dream Academy in Japan in 2000. The compilation album contains the extended version of Life In A Northern Town and an acoustic version of The Party rather than the more common versions. At the time of its release, Nick Laird-Clowes revealed that the band actually had no involvement with the album, and he went on further to say that they weren t even informed by Warners that a compilation album was being made. According to Kate St John, around the same time that this album was being made, Warner Brothers were considering a US compilation album, but they and the band decided to re-issue their first album, The Dream Academy . Because of its somewhat limited availability, it is one of the more sought after Dream Academy albums.

The Metropolitan Goods Railway Line is a network of freight (or goods) railway lines in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia. 

Route.
The line starts at Port Botany in Sydney's south, and joins the Bankstown railway line at Sydenham. It then runs beside the Bankstown Line to the suburb of Dulwich Hill where it branches off and heads north through Lewisham, passing beneath the Main Suburban Railway before heading north through Lilyfield to the Glebe Island port and Rozelle Goods yard. A branch of the line then passes over a brick viaduct through Glebe Jubilee Park, then through a tunnel beneath the suburb of Glebe, to pass over another brick viaduct over Wentworth Park. The line then swings north to loop through the former industrial suburb of Pyrmont, before passing beside Darling Harbour. Here, it served the former large Darling Harbour Goods yard. It then passes south beside the former Ultimo Power Station (now the Powerhouse Museum) and Ultimo tram depot (now closed), under Railway Square to join the railway lines south of Central station. The line was electrified from Dulwich Hill to the Rozelle goods yard, although no electrified freight trains now run in New South Wales.

History.
The line opened in 1922. The section from Rozelle Goods Yard to Central Station was closed in the late 1980's when Darling Harbour was redeveloped from a Goods Yard into its current form as a leisure and tourist precinct.

Current.
In August 2004, the  Australian Rail Track Corporation and Rail Corporation New South Wales entered into an agreement for ARTC to lease the Metropolitan Freight Network, specified as being the dedicated freight lines within the rail corridors:
Sefton Park to Chullora;
Flemington South to Belmore;
Belmore to Marrickville (shared passenger and freight corridor - separate tracks);
Marrickville to Botany and Dulwich Hill to Rozelle.

The ARTC is constructing the Southern Sydney Freight Line to extend the freight network from Sefton to Macarthur.

The section between Dulwich Hill and Rozelle sees only irregular freight service now. Rozelle goods yard is overgrown and has been used intermittently for the storage of disused railway wagons and passenger cars. After unrealised plans to run suburban trains in the 1980's, the section from Lilyfield through Glebe, Pyrmont and Ultimo has been converted into the Metro Light Rail line to Central station.

Lithuania is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular - apskritis, plural - apskritys) that are further sub-divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular - savivaldyb , plural - savivaldyb s). There are three types of municipalities: 
 District municipalities (Lithuanian: rajono savivaldyb )   there are 43 district municipalities that roughly correspond to districts that existed under the Soviet rule. It is quite common to refer to these as simply districts because the word "municipality" was only added in 1994. These districts were created as a local version of raions.
 City municipalities (Lithuanian: miesto savivaldyb )   there are 8 city municipalities. Six of these are based on the 6 largest cities. These 6 cities are also capitals of their corresponding district municipalities, thus these city municipalities could correspond to urban municipalities, while the district municipalities are rural. The special status of Visaginas city municipality (based on the 13th largest city) can be explained by the fact that the majority of the residents are Russians. Palanga city municipality is called this despite actually including a group of popular sea resorts rather than a single city.
 Municipalities   there are 9 municipalities created in 2000 by "Municipalities Reform Act." They do not contain either "city" or "district" in their name. Neringa municipality existed before as Neringa city municipality. ;

All municipalities, with three exceptions, Klaip da district municipality (capital Garg¸dai), Akmen  district municipality (capital Naujoji Akmen ) and Neringa municipality (capital Nida), are named after their capitals. Municipalities are further sub-divided into more than 500 elderates (Lithuanian: singular - seni nija, plural - seni nijos). For more information, see Subdivisions of Lithuania.

Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya is a book containing a compilation of writings by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. A significant proportion of the subject matter of this book is dedicated to the defence of Islam, Muhammad and the Qur'an against allegations by opponents of Islam in late 19th century. The book was written in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's native language, Urdu. It has since then been translated into English and many other languages.

<doc id="3174359" title="Fanie de Villiers" nonfiltered="395" processed="392" dbindex="450398">

Petrus Stephanus ("Fanie") de Villiers (born 13 October 1964, Vereeniging, Transvaal), South Africa), was a cricketer who played 18 Tests and 83 One-day Internationals for South Africa as a right arm fast-medium bowler and right hand batsman between 1992 and 1998.

De Villiers debuted in first class cricket in 1985-86 for Northern Transvaal B. He opened the bowling in both innings, taking 5 for 33 in the second. He also played a season for English county team Kent in 1990.

In 1993-94, at the age of 29, he was called up for the Test tour of Australia. He was selected for the first Test in Melbourne but it was at the second Test in Sydney where De Villiers established himself at Test level. With Australia needing just 117 runs to win, De Villiers took 6 for 43, including the final wicket - a return catch from Glenn McGrath - to lead South Africa to a five run victory. De Villiers' match figures of 10 for 123 saw him named Man of the Match.

Former England captain Tony Greig had said at the start of the final innings that South Africa's chances were 100-1. At the Man of the Match presentation, De Villiers reminded him of his statement, adding, "You know South Africans; we never give up."

De Villiers showed further courage in the third Test in Adelaide when, despite not being able to bowl in Australia's second innings, he batted for 198 minutes as a nightwatchman, scoring 30 in South Africa's loss.

On this tour, De Villiers, when acting as twelfth man, would use a remote control car to send drinks to the batsmen on the field.

Against England at The Oval in 1994, De Villiers bowled a bouncer to English fast bowler Devon Malcolm hitting him on the front of the helmet and knocking him to the ground. Upon regaining his feet, Malcolm is reported to have said to the nearby South African fieldsmen, "You guys are history". Malcolm took 9 for 57 in South Africa's second innings, the sixth best bowling figures in Test history to that time, and England went on to win by 8 wickets.

1994-95 was an outstanding season for De Villiers. In five Tests, he took 36 wickets averaging 17.47. In the Test against Pakistan in Johannesburg, De Villiers became the first ever South African to score a fifty and take ten wickets in the same Test, scoring 66 not out and taking 6 for 81 and 4 for 27. He was subsequently named the South African Cricket Annual Cricketer of the Year in 1995, an award he had previously won in 1989.

A popular player, de Villers was known by the nickname Vinnige Fanie (Fast Fanie) by his Afrikaans-speaking fans.

De Villiers attended school at the Heidelberg Volkskool and matriculated in 1982. While there, he represented South African Schools as a javelin thrower.

Since his retirement, De Villiers has worked as a television commentator in South Africa and also works as a corporate speaker. He was a judge in the 1995 Miss World pageant in Sun City. De Villiers has become involved in raising money for deaf charities as he has both a brother and a daughter who are deaf. He raised R800 000 cycling from Cape Town to Pretoria and R189 000 sitting at the top of a floodlight tower at a Test match in Centurion.

In 2003, Trevor Chesterfield published a biography of De Villiers entitled Fanie De Villiers: Portrait of a Test Bowler.

Episode recap.

Major case unit.
Detective Jimmy McNulty visits the morgue and asks Doc Frazier, the medical examiner, to look at the case of D'Angelo Barksdale's supposed suicide having learned of the events after going to visit him in prison. McNulty discusses the suicide over drinks with Bunk and complains that the state police spoiled the investigation. Bunk agrees with McNulty simply because he believes it is unlikely for an African American male to commit suicide by hanging themself. McNulty concurs jokingly telling Bunk that he is a good example of an African American male who has all the reason he needs to commit suicide but does not. They then run a short con to win over a woman in the bar. McNulty returns to the morgue and Frazier reports that D'Angelo could have been strangled and had a bruise on his mid-back. McNulty visits D'Angelo's ex-girlfriend Donette to ask her about his death. She is dismissive and doesn't tell him anything.

Cheese attends an underground dogfight with a dealer named Tree from his crew. His dog fights against one owned by a dealer named Dazz and trained by Jelly. Cheese's dog is quickly beaten and he shoots it rather than give it medical attention. Tree tells Cheese that he suspects foul play in his dog's loss. Soon afterwards Tree kills Jelly out on the street in front of his hoppers. They report the killing to Dazz.

The detail pick up some discussion of Tree's crime on the wire. Soon after they hear another dealer called Peanut has been killed. Then Cheese himself discusses shooting his dog over the phone, the detail assume he is talking about a murder and guess there is some kind of drug war going on. Freamon calls homicide to ask how many new murders there are on the East side but Norris has little time for him and hangs up without answering his questions. He sends Kima home while he goes to homicide to find out what he can. Greggs has an uncomfortable evening discussing her new baby with Cheryl.

The unit meets with ASA Pearlman for lunch to discuss the murders. Daniels wants to use their evidence to make arrests. McNulty argues that they should wait and gather more evidence but the rest of the detail feel that the murders are enough to act upon. Massey tracks Cheese's crew planning to attack Dazz after meeting at Tree's girlfriend Neesey's house. The detail makes a raid on the house and arrests Cheese, Tree and another soldier with weapons on them.

Bunk and McNulty interrogate Cheese. When Bunk repeats his speech about killing the dog Cheese breaks down. Foerster and Daniels watch from outside as Cheese begins to relate the story. Rawls and Major Taylor are impressed with Daniels' work. In the interrogation McNulty and Bunk realize that dog is not a person. When they leave the interrogation room, Daniels is upset to learn that the most they can charge Cheese with is illegal discharge of a firearm and improper disposal of an animal, or animal cruelty at the very worst. The unit drowns their sorrows and McNulty fails to get Pearlman to leave with him. Pearlman instead makes a move on Daniels and he takes her home. Greggs arrives home to find Cheryl sleeping with the baby and turns around and goes out drinking.

The following day the unit's wiretaps have all gone dead.

Western District.
Herc and Carver cruise the Western district talking trash. Herc calls over Justin, one of Marlo's dealers, to ask him about his sideways cap. Justin does not even realize that he is joking. Herc spots Poot working a new corner now that the terrace is gone. Later he and Carver pick him up and question him. They ask how he is able to walk into new territory without getting into trouble with other dealers.

Major Colvin learns from his community relations sergeant and Lieutenant Mello that his beat officers are working hard to reclassify reported crimes to reduce the felony rate, as his superiors asked. An officer named Burman has been particularly effective.

Herc, Carver and Dozerman go to the movies with their girlfriends and are mortified to bump into Bodie, Poot and Puddin. As they leave, Herc and Carver look fondly at Dozerman's attracitve African American girlfriend away from their own girlfriends. Carver and Dozerman continue to tease Herc about his selection of a man to have sex with to get any woman he desires. Dozerman acts as the undercover officer for a late night hand-to-hand and is shot when the deal goes badly. Colvin is called at home and immediately goes out to meet his men. Carver blames himself for sending Dozerman alone. Colvin arrives and tells them that Dozerman will live, largely because they got him to the hospital quickly. Herc tells Colvin that their suspect took Dozerman's gun.

Colvin visits his friend the church deacon for a cup of coffee. Colvin reveals that he has reached the point where the absence of a negative makes a good night's work for him and he feels he has to change that before he retires.

Colvin gives a briefing to his men the day following the shooting. He suspends all undercover narcotics work. He draws parallels between the drug prohibition and the alcohol prohibition. He remembers the paper bag as a moment of civic compromise in the alcohol prohibition that freed up officers to do real police work. Colvin wishes there were a paper bag for drugs. Back out on the street Herc cannot understand his commander's reasoning.

Barksdale organization.
Shamrock and Country arrive with a resupply of narcotics for some of their drug dealers. Omar poses as a veteran returning from the hospital with Kimmy acting as his nurse to get inside the house. Once inside they draw their weapons and let in Dante and Tosha. They catch Shamrock and Country coming down the stairs with the money. 

Stringer visits Avon at the prison and they talk about the demolition of their tower territory. He reveals his plan to try and supply other dealers. Avon asks Stringer to target specific high turnover areas. He reminds Stringer they need to maintain their reputation to hold down trade. Stringer agrees but says that the violence was what brought Avon to prison and if they can make money without it they should.

Stringer's lieutenant's Country, Shamrock and Bodie are sent to talk to mid-level dealers to try and usurp their suppliers. Country's offer is met with skepticism, Shamrock has more success by making the financial advantages clear and Bodie cannot even find his target initially. He is supposed to approach Marlo Stanfield but upon approaching Jamal, a low level Stanfield dealer, he learns that Marlo is nowhere to be found. Bodie marshalls his crew to set up in the middle of the block through his second Puddin. Stanfield corner boss Fruit looks on and prevents Jamal from raising arms against Bodie. He contacts Marlo who drives round to talk to him and tells him to ignore Bodie and go back to work.

Stringer holds another meeting at the funeral home and Bodie and country report their difficulties. Stringer sends Bodie out to look for Marlo immediately. Shamrock reports Omar's robbery and Slim Charles remarks that it is the second robbery that week.

Marlo visits his advisor Vinson at his rim shop for advice on handling the Barksdale organization. Vinson advises him to prepare for war if he is not willing to compromise. Marlo stands on the corner the following day and when Bodie approaches he doesn't make eye contact and tells Bodie to pack up and move on while he is still being a gentleman.

Cutty.
Cutty meets with his parole officer who tells him to find work but is not willing to offer advice on where to look. He finds casual work with a group of gardeners. He appears perplexed when a homeowner attempts to communicate with the gardening crew in broken Spanish, but says nothing.

Politics.
Carcetti visists Major Valchek's office and they discuss his ploy of using the subcomittee to pressure Burrell. Valchek calls it a win win situation - if Burrell caves he has an inside man in the mayor's office and if he doesn't he gains political capital by harassing Burrell over high crime rates. He asks Valchek to broker a meeting with Burrell. Valchek meets with Burrell and convinces him to take the meeting. Carcetti tells Burrell that he is tired of being ignored.

At the comstat meeting Rawls berates Eastern district commander Major Taylor for his poor performance. Under Taylor's command, the Eastern district has made only sixteen felony arrests in a month and confiscated no handguns while four homicides occur in a five hour time period. Upset at the lack of progress in investigating the four recent homicides including James Taylor (Jelly) and Tree, Rawls informs Taylor that he has eight hours to get a grip on things or he is done in the unit.

Burrell has dinner with Carcetti and thanks him for helping him with repairing police vehicles. Having had a good experience Burrell reveals that he has 70 men retiring and Mayor Royce has failed to give him promised money for training new officers and Carcetti offers to look into it.

First Appearances.
The Deacon: Well known and influential West side church man.

The Family Aizoaceae (fig-marigold family or ice plant family) is a taxon of dicotyledonous flowering plants containing some 126 genera and between 1100-2000 species. They are commonly known as stone plants or carpet weeds. 

The family is widely recognised by taxonomists, although once it went by the botanical name "Ficoideae", now disallowed. The APG II system of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system of 1998) also recognises the family, and assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots.

Most species in this family come from southern Africa, but a few are from Australia and the Central Pacific.

Most fig-marigolds are herbaceous, rarely somewhat woody, with stems growing either erect or prostrate. Leaves are simple, opposite or alternate, and more or less succulent with entire (or rarely toothed) margins. Flowers are perfect in most species (but unisexual in some), actinomorphic, and appear singularly or in few-flowered cymes developing from the leaf axils. Sepals are typically 5 (3-8) and more or less connate (fused) below. True petals are absent. However, some species have numerous linear petals derived from staminoides. The fruit is a capsule with one to numerous seeds per cell.   

A few species (especially the Ice Plant, Carpobrotus edulis) have been widely introduced and become invasive. A species known as New Zealand spinach (Tetragonia tetragonioides) is grown as a garden plant in somewhat dry climates and used as an alternative to spinach in upscale salads.

In mechanism design, participation constraints or rational participation constraints are said to be satisfied if a mechanism leaves all participants at least as well off as they would have been if they hadn't participated.

Unfortunately, it can frequently be shown that participation constraints are incompatible with other desirable properties of mechanisms for many purposes.

One kind of participation constraint is called the "participation criterion" for voting systems.  It requires that by voting, a voter should not decrease the odds of their preferred candidates winning.

Get Happy is a term used in the African American Gospel Music tradition, that refers to the experience of receiving the Holy Spirit during a Church service, usually involving ecstatic singing, or during prayer, or spontaneously.

Accounts of nineteenth century African American slave spirituality use the term, as recorded in the book "God Struck Me Dead, Voices of Ex-Slaves" 

All of my people were great Christians. Shouting, singing, praying, and good old heartfelt religion make up the things that filled their lives.  Aunt Charlotte used to cry most all the time when she got happy. - an ex-slave preacher, in "God Struck Me Dead", page 75.

One of the early nineteenth century traditional 'Negro Spirituals' to use the phrase, is the following:

GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY;

Good morning everybody;
Good morning everybody, Lord;
My soul got happy this morning;
My soul got happy this morning, Lord;

You may call me  hypocrite member ;
You may call me  hypocrite member , Lord;
But my soul got happy, this morning;
But my soul got happy this morning, Lord;

I m going to see my mother;
I m going to see my mother, Lord;
Going to sit down by my Jesus;
Going to sit down by my Jesus, Lord.

"Get Happy" was a popular tune drawing on this tradition, with words by Ted Koehler and music by Harold Arlen. It was performed by Ruth Etting, Nat Shilkret, and Frankie Trumbauer in 1930, Frank Sinatra in 1950, Frankie Laine in 1951, and Ella Fitzgerald, Jane Froman and Susan Hayward in 1952. However, it is most commonly associated with Judy Garland, who performed it in her last MGM film Summer Stock in 1950. For the number, Garland wore the top half of a man's tuxedo, black nylons and fedora creating an iconic image. After 1950, she frequently performed the song in her concert and television performances.

Get Happy!! is also the title of an album by the musician Elvis Costello, possibly inspired by the Gospel music use of the term, but not containing any Gospel music per se.

Tassos Nikolaou Papadopoulos (Greek:                    ) born January 7, 1934) has been the president of the Republic of Cyprus since 2003. He was born in Nicosia, Cyprus. He was educated at the Pancyprian Gymnasium in Nicosia and then  studied law in London (Gray's Inn, Barrister-at-Law).

In the late 1950s, Papadopoulos was active in PEKA, the political section of EOKA. 

He took part in the London Conference in 1959 and was one of the two delegates (besides the AKEL delegates) who voted against the signing of the London and Zurich Agreements. He was also one of the four representatives of the Greek Cypriot side at the Constitutional Commission which drafted the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus.

For 12 years he served successively as Minister of the Interior, Minister of Finance, Minister of Labour and Social Insurance, Minister of Health and Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

He served as advisor to the first representative of the Greek-Cypriot side in the intercommunal talks, Glafkos Klerides, until April 1976 and subsequently he took up that post himself, serving until July 1978.

He represented Cyprus at many international conferences, particularly the annual congresses of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

Furthermore he represented the Greek Cypriot community in many recourses by Cyprus filed at the United Nations and the Council of Europe.
Until his election he practiced law in Nicosia.

At the Parliamentary elections held on 15 July 1970 he was elected member of the House of Representatives, standing as an Eniaion (Unified Party) candidate for the Nicosia constituency. Standing as an independent candidate, he was re-elected in the election of 5 September 1976. From April until October 1976 he served as President of the House of Representatives. In the 19 May 1991 parliamentary elections he was elected member of the House of Representatives, standing as a candidate for the Democratic Party in the Nicosia constituency. He was re-elected on 26 May 1996.

On 7 October 2000, he was elected unopposed President of the Democratic Party during the historic electoral congress at which the founder of the Party, Spyros Kyprianou, stood down. At the 27 May 2001 elections he was re-elected at the head of the Democratic Party ticket.

He was a member of the National Council, Chairman of the Standing Parliamentary Committee on European Affairs and member of the Committee on Selection and the Committee on Financial and Budgetary Affairs. He was also Co-chairman of the Joint Cyprus-EU Parliamentary Committee.

He campaigned for the 2003 presidential election on a platform that he would allegedly be able to secure better deal over the Cyprus dispute than the incumbent Glafkos Klerides.  He was backed by not just his own party, Diko, but also the party of the Left AKEL and social democrat Kisos.

Papadopoulos assumed the Presidency on 28 February 2003 after a 51.51% win, having won the elections on the first round. 

Before the Cyprus reunification referendum, 2004 on the Annan plan, he urged Greek Cypriots to vote No, declaring "I received a state; I will not deliver a community". His recommendation is considered one of the reasons for the referendum's negative result on the Greek Cypriot side.

He is married to Fotini Michaelides (of the family of Anastasios Leventis) and they have four children: Konstandinos, Maria (from Fotini's previous marriage with Polykarpos Georkadjis), Nikolas and Anastasia.

The expedition (1901-1904) was led by Otto Nordenskjöld and Carl A. Larsen (the captain of the ship Antarctic). 

Two key Antarctic islands are associated with the expedition. The first is Snow Hill Island (64º 27' S, 57º 12' W), where Otto Nordenskjöld and five of his colleagues spent two winters (one of them planned and the second forced by the sinking of the relief ship Antarctic). On his way to Snow Hill Island in 1901, Nordenskjöld had passed through Buenos Aires, where the Argentine government gave him supplies and other assistance on the condition that he include in his wintering-over party a young Argentine naval officer, Lieutenant José Sobral. Sobral spent the two years with Nordenskjöld at Snow Hill Island, becoming the first Argentine to spend time in Antarctica. The presence of this officer was also a factor which probably influenced the Argentine government to mount a rescue effort in 1903 with the corvette Uruguay, which successfully brought back all the surviving members of the Nordenskjöld party.
 
The second is Paulet Island (63°35' S , 55°47' W). This is where the crew of the Antarctic were stranded from February 1903 until November 1903. After their ship sank, crushed by the ice about 25 miles away, the twenty men from the Antarctic landed here in their lifeboat and built a sturdy double-walled stone hut whose remains are clearly visible today. Apart from the limited supplies they brought from the Antarctic, they survived on the thousand or so penguins they killed, as well as the birds' eggs.

CleanFlicks is a now defunct, Utah-based business that produced edited movies to remove content that they considered inappropriate for children or that viewers might otherwise find offensive.  Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) were its predominant market.  Many Mormons consider it inconsistent with their beliefs to watch rated-R movies but many consider edited copies acceptable.  The popularity of CleanFlicks edited movies had made it notable as an icon of Mormon culture in Utah.  CleanFlicks removed profanity, sexual content, and some violence from movies, either by muting audio or clipping entire portions of the track.  As Mormons find exclamations referencing God offensive as well, such references were also usually removed.

Similar companies in the US market who still perform family-friendly movie editing include Family Edited DVDs, Flick's Club, Family Safe Movies, and Family Safe DVDs. Alternatively, a system called ClearPlay uses a customized DVD player to perform downloaded edits in real-time during playback, instead of playing back pre-edited movies.

Court Ruling.
On July 6, 2006, a federal judge in Denver presiding over a lawsuit between CleanFlicks and 16 Hollywood directors ruled that CleanFlicks' editing violates U.S. copyright laws.  The judge ordered the company to "stop producing, manufacturing, creating, and renting" edited movies, and to hand all inventory to movie studios within five days of the ruling. The court gave the company more time than the ruling's initial 5-day deadline for turning over the stock of edited movies, since CleanFlicks needed more time to receive movies that were still out on rental.

CleanFlicks had planned to appeal the ruling, but informed its customers by email on July 28, 2006:

"It is with great regret that we write to inform you that CleanFlicks is going out of business soon. As you may have heard or read, after three long years of legal struggles, a judge in Colorado has ruled that we cannot sell or rent edited DVDs anymore. While we thought very strongly about appealing the decision, the potential costs and risks to the company, its customers and shareholders was just too great. Accordingly, we have agreed to close our doors after a brief winding-up period.

...We want to offer our sincerest apologies for not being able to provide you with edited DVDs...We appreciate your support of our efforts to provide high-quality, family-friendly movies, and we will try to make this difficult process of closing our operations as painless as we can for all our loyal customers."

The decision to not appeal the ruling became primarily a financial one. Having won the initial court battle, the directors and studios were in a position to collect significant damages for copyright infringement from the editing companies. Although the companies would almost certainly receive a stay of judgement pending appeals, the risk was much higher now. Since the inventory of edited movies had no value to the studios, a deal was offered whereby the companies would be allowed to sell off all of their inventory and keep the profits if they agreed to not appeal the ruling and the studios would not pursue damage claims. Thus, the companies, and their investors, would collect further revenue and be protected from damages and the studios would have a significant court ruling stand and the legal precedent would be set.  After discussions with their legal teams and investors, the decision was made to accept the offer. The companies were then given additional time to clear out their inventory but no more films could be edited during that time. All unsold inventory was then sent to the studios as defined by the ruling. 

Cleanflicks closed for business on August 31, 2006.

Budhanilkantha School is a public and boarding school.  Instructions start from the 4th grade through high school. It was established in 1972 on the outskirts of Kathmandu valley with the aim of being the national school where gifted children from all corners of Nepal could get educated, including those from poor economic backgrounds, who might otherwise not receive good education.  More than one-third of the students receive some form of scholarship from the government or private British organizations to cover the cost of their education and stay in school.  The school was opened by the Nepali and UK Governments. The British ran the administration of the school until 1995, after which the administration was handed over to Nepalis.  The school was an all boys school until 1992, when it became co-educational. 

The school educates students from grades 4 to 10, following the government curriculum.  After completing grade 10, students can choose between studying for the University of Cambridge GCE A-levels or the Higher Secondary Education Board's +2 education programme.  Most students go on to attend colleges and universities in Nepal, India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The alumni association (SEBS Online) of Budhanilkantha school is actively engaged in uplifting Nepalese society through various programmes.

The school is considered the National School of Nepal. The main aim of the school is to provide its students with quality education and various extra curricular activities. There are several clubs in the school which organise programs of various sorts throughout the year.

Budhanilkantha school is a fully residential school. Students are assigned to the 12 houses according to sex and class standing. Most of the teachers also live within the compounds of the school. Because of these circumstances many argue that Budhanilkantha School is an educational bubble greatly lacking in providing a thriving enviroment for social skill development. Others criticise it as a launching ground for both students and teachers alike to go abroad. Apart from this, the school is considered mostly without fault producing a number of highly successful graduates each year.

The houses are - 1 Makalu, 2 Annapurna, 3 Dhaulagiri, 4 Kanchanjungha,    5 Nilgiri, 6 Pumori, 7 Hiunchuli, 8 Saipal, 9 Ratnachuli, 10 Choyu, 11 Byasrishi and 12 Gaurishankar. All the houses are named after randomly chosen himalayan peaks. 1 and 3 are junior boys house. 2 and 4 are middle boys houses. 5 and 6 are senior boys houses. 7 and 8 are junior and middle girls houses. 9 and 10 are senior and upper senior girls houses. 11 and 12 are the uppermost senoir houses.
Students to be enrolled in this school must pass a very through entrance exam and the students are taken for class four and for post SLC levels. This ensures the continuation of high acedemic status of the school.

 The mixed martial arts fight between Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar in the finals of The Ultimate Fighter 1 contest received national acclaim, and was highly regarded amongst fans as one of the most exciting and memorable fights in the history of the UFC. The bout was voted fight of the year by a poll of over 19,000 readers of the website MMAWeekly.com,  and was recognized as the 2005 Shoot Match of the Year by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.

 Background .

The first season of The Ultimate Fighter reality television show featured sixteen mixed martial artists divided into two weight classes: middleweight and light heavyweight.  Two coaches, Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell, were selected to mentor the contestants; the contestants would be divided and distributed evenly among the two teams, and a series of exhibitions would take place until only two fighters from each weight class were remaining.  The finalists would appear on national television in the finale of the show and would compete to win a contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Forrest Griffin was one of the light heavyweights selected by Chuck Liddell, and Stephan Bonnar was chosen by concurrent champion, Randy Couture.

In the road to the finals, both fighters had to defeat two opponents.  On episode seven, Stephan Bonnar defeated Bobby Southworth from Team Liddell in a controversial split decision; Southworth left the exhibition room in anger and was confronted by UFC President Dana White shortly after.  On episode nine, Forrest Griffin defeated his first opponent, Alex Schoenauer, by TKO, but suffered a deep cut on his eyebrow in the process that jeapordized his status on the show.  Griffin was notified that, if his cut would not heal by the time of his next fight, he would be replaced; Griffin understood this, and continued anyway.

In the semi-finals, the contestants were informed that they would be fighting the remaining teammate in their respective weight class to decide who would proceed to the finals.  In the first of two light heavyweight semi-final matches, Forrest Griffin defeated Sam Hoger by TKO.  Afterwards, Stephan Bonnar defeated teammate Mike Swick by triangle choke / armbar submission; with this, the light heavyweight finals were set.

The fight.
After overcoming a series of grueling challenges and besting all of their opponents, Forrest Griffin (Team Liddell) and Stephan Bonnar (Team Couture) arrived at the Cox Pavilion in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 9, 2005 to compete in what would soon be considered one of the most exciting and memorable fights in UFC history.  Their fight would be broadcasted nationally on Spike TV.

The fight was refereed by Herb Dean, and was slated for three 5-minute rounds - the standard UFC format for non-title fights.

The first round saw both fighters engaging aggressively; neither fighter offered to "touch gloves" as the fight commenced (a gesture of good will in the profession).  Both fighters exchanged punches and the occasional low kick, with Griffin gaining a slight advantage (according to color commentator Joe Rogan).  Bonnar, however, remained undeterred.  There continued to be a stalemate in the standing portion of the fight (i.e., boxing and kickboxing), and the first round ended with no clear-cut winner.  Rogan called the first round the "Hagler-Hearns" of mixed martial arts history (alluding to a famous boxing bout between Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns, known as The War).

In the second round, Bonnar began getting the better of the offensive exchanges.  Early in the round, a jab by Bonnar created a laceration on the nose of Griffin, prompting the referee to stop the fight so a doctor could check the cut and clear Griffin to fight.  The doctor saw no danger of the cut bleeding into Griffin's eyes - a common fear among mixed martial artists - so the fight was continued.  As the round went on, Bonnar continued to hold a slight advantage in striking over a very tired Griffin, who sustained several knees to the face and body while being controlled in Bonnar's Muay Thai clinch.  The round ended with Griffin failing a takedown attempt, and Bonnar defending Griffin's offensive Thai clinch.

In the third and final round, a fatigued Griffin started offensively with low kicks and punches, with Bonnar attempting to counterattack from a distance.  Griffin engaged Bonnar actively, delivering several knees from the Thai clinch.  In the middle part of the round, Bonnar increased his activity, landing several short punches while infighting.  As the round went on, however, Bonnar continued to take a defensive position, counterattacking only when opportunities were present.  Much like the first round, the third round continued with no clear advantage going to either fighter; the round ended with Griffin holding Bonnar in a Thai clinch and attacking with knees, followed by a short exchange of punches.

As there was no conclusion to the fight inside the three-round time limit, the decision was left up to the judges at ringside.  All three judges scored the fight 29-28 in favor of the winner, Forrest Griffin, to which the crowd responded with mixed reactions.

Griffin was awarded a contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as a brand new Scion car, a dirt bike, and a high-end watch.

Aftermath.
 Despite losing to Griffin in the finals, Stephan Bonnar was awarded a UFC contract due to his performance in the ring.  In the months following the fight, Griffin and Bonnar would often be mentioned alongside one another, and their performance would set the standard for every TUF fighter to come.  At the finale of TUF 2, for example, Dana White said of the Welterweight finals, "...in my opinion, ladies and gentlemen, that was Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin, only on the ground."

Spike TV hosted a segment on their website entitled "He Said / He Said," featuring both Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonnar.  The two fighters voiced their opinions and analyses of the The Ultimate Fighter on an episode-by-episode basis.  This feature originated during season two, but was extended for the next two seasons because of its popularity.  After some post-fight drug-testing controversy involving Stephan Bonnar following UFC 62, the "He Said / He Said" feature was taken down and has not been seen since.

The rematch.
After winning a fight against James Irvin at UFC's Ultimate Fight Night 3, Bonnar implied an interest in a rematch with Forrest Griffin.  Initially, there were no official statements indicating when (or if) a rematch would take place.

On June 16, 2006, MMANews.com reported that Griffin and Bonnar would once against meet inside the UFC arena for the anticipated rematch at UFC 62.   The Boston Herald reported the same thing on their website. 

UFC 62.
As announced, the rematch took place at UFC 62 on August 26, 2006.  Both fighters were greeted with applause when they made their way to the arena.  The referee for the bout was Steve Mazzagatti.

In the first round, both fighters were noticeably more tentative than they were in their first encounter.  Griffin used his jab to keep Bonnar at a distance, and Bonnar waited for counterpunching opportunities, opting at one point to attempt a spinning back kick.  Griffin was more active than Bonnar in the first round, and although no serious damage was inflicted, the first round was scored in favor of Forrest Griffin, according to Eddie Bravo.

The second round saw much of the same action that took place the first round.  Bonnar, however, became slightly more active, and was engaging more frequently in striking exchanges with Griffin.  Although the round was close, Bravo felt that Griffin was overall more active, and scored the round accordingly.

In the third period, Bonnar began landing more strikes in the first half of the bout.  When the round seemed to tilt in favor of Bonnar, though, Griffin began to push forward with strikes, landing sharp right hands and finishing the round with the same intensity that defined the first fight.

When the bout was finished, all three ringside judges scored the bout 30-27 for Forrest Griffin, who felt the fight was closer than that. 

Post-fight controversy.
After UFC 62, Bonnar tested positive for the illegal substance Boldenone, a type of anabolic steroid.  Although Bonnar's request for an extention on the case was granted, the commission ultimately issued a 9-month suspension on Bonnar's fighter's license and fined him $5,000.   As a result of the controversy, Spike TV had released Bonnar from his duties as a broadcaster on SpikeTV.com; the popular "He Said / He Said" segment disappeared from the website shortly after the drug-testing incident arose.  Following the commission's issuance of the suspension, UFC President Dana White voiced his support of the commission's investigation while remaining empathetic to Bonnar's cause.

 Overview .

Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority, Inc. (   ), an Asian-Interest sorority was founded on March 23 1994 at the University at Albany and incorporated in New York on March 15 1996 by their Founding Mothers: Gina Han, Sally Hsieh, Jean Kim, Jenny Kim, Sandra Lam, Winnie Liu, Yan-Chieh Liu, Michelle Macaraig, Sung-Yon Noh and Loan Trang. The sorority's colors are red and gold and its flower is a yellow rose with baby's breath.

As a multicultural, Asian-Interest Greek organization, Sigma Psi Zeta is a cultural, social, educational and community service oriented sorority. It stands today as the third largest Asian Interest sorority in the nation. Sigma's philanthropic focus is to combat violence against women in its various forms. On a national level, Sigma Psi Zeta has adopted the New York Asian Women's Center as its adopted shelter.

Sigma Psi Zeta currently has active sisterships in New York, California, Washington (state), Maryland, Virginia, Washington D.C., Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Colorado. It has 20 sisterships across the United States, and continues to expand.

More information can be found at Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority, Inc.

 History .

In the Fall of 1993, a group of undergraduate women came together. These women, hailing from different cultural backgrounds, became close friends. While musing about the state of their campus and their friendships, the idea of forming a sorority casually came up. They believed that a sorority built on their friendships and sharing their vision could address a gap that existed on the SUNY Albany campus. This idea solidified. These women believed that a sorority built on their friendships, laughter, strengths and dedication would be a formidable force. Over the course of the semester, their group of friends grew closer and in size.

On February 28 1994, the Founding Mothers of Sigma Psi Zeta sat down together over dinner to discuss their common goal. They all aimed to establish an organization that encompassed the strength of today's Asian-American woman and her potential for making an impact on the world around her. They came together as friends, realizing the apathy towards Asian women and the dual-disadvantage for being "The Silent Minority." 

On March 23 1994, the State University of New York at Albany formally recognized the sisterhood of Sigma Psi Zeta. This was the birth of many firsts. Our Alpha Chapter was established on that date, and with it, the birth of the first East Coast-based Asian sorority in the United States. The founding mothers struggled to establish our organization, our purpose, and most importantly, a precedence by fighting the odds. 

Sigma Psi Zeta immediately became a positive influence for the University at Albany campus community, as well as its Asian community. Realizing the importance of expanding their leadership, empowerment, and service, they initiated their first pledge class and established a second chapter less than a year later, which is known today as the Beta Chapter at the State University of New York at Binghamton. They too were pioneers, becoming the first Asian-interest sorority to be established in Binghamton, NY.

Since its inception over ten years ago, Sigma Psi Zeta has expanded into nine states and eighteen schools. All sisterships are populated by members who have pledged to uphold the same beliefs as the Founders. Growth has been steady, and expansion for the mere sake of numbers has never been favored over strengthening from within. From the first chapter in Albany, Sigma Psi Zeta has remained steadfast in continued growth of a sisterhood which keeps pace with the ever-changing nature of the collegiate world and contemporary Asian society.

Sisters of Sigma Psi Zeta are pioneers and activists as their Founding Mothers were before them. The sisters, both undergraduate and alumnae, enjoy a distinguished reputation for activism, scholarship, character, and leadership. Sigmas are women who share the beliefs of the Founders, sharing the bond of universal sisterhood in their hearts and lives. It is an organization that seeks to educate and enlighten all people - regardless of race - about Asian/Asian-American struggles, achievements, interests, and identities in an everchanging world.

 Philanthropy .
 Background .
In 1999, the sisters of SYZ formally adopted their National Philanthropy, to Combat Violence Against Women. The first Asian-interest sorority to take on this cause, SYZ hopes to bring awareness of this issue to our universities and communities as well as the community at large. Sigma sisters have built a campaign to help those affected by violence, to educate the community about the nature of this problem, and to empower our sisters to make a lasting commitment to the issue of violence against women.

 About Our Philanthropy .
The National Philanthropy of Sigma Psi Zeta is to combat violence against women in its varied forms. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: rape, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, exploitation, the trafficking of women and children, the abuse of migrant workers, intimidation at work, child abuse, harassment, and spousal abuse. Any kind of physical, emotional or mental duress constitutes violence.

 2006-07 Philanthropic Projects.
Sigma Psi Zeta has adopted two philanthropic projects for the 2006-07 academic school year- marrow registration drives and supporting the American Cancer Society. In hopes of finding a marrow match for a University of Rochester alum and chartering sister, all sisterships will hold marrow registration drives at their schools in the fall semester. More information can be found at wincheng.believable.org In addition to these marrow drives, all sisterships will actively participate in American Cancer Society events and fundraising throughout the school year.

 Beliefs .

Vision:
To become an international organization uniting the sisters to follow the code of loyalty, allegiance, and dedication.

Mission:
To promote unity among women and awareness of the Asian/Asian American culture and heritage.

Goal:
To best demonstrate sisterhood and allegiance by merging all efforts and interests to provide an invaluable experience for the sisters, and services to their local communities and the community at large.

4 Baruch, also known as the Paraleipomena of Jeremiah when combined with the Epistle of Jeremy, is a text regarded as apocryphal by all Christian denominations except for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  It is regarded as pseudepigraphal.

The term Paraleipomena of Jeremiah appears as the title in several ancient Greek manuscripts of the work, and means the things left out from Jeremiah.  

The text appears to have been heavily edited, and while the start and end clearly portray Jeremiah as the hero, several other parts of the text elevate Baruch, from being a mere scribe, to the status of an intermediary between Jeremiah and God. Many parts of the text are believed to have been added by Christian writers, not the least obvious being the description of Jeremiah as being stoned to death due to his prophecying the coming of Jesus.

The underlying theological aim of the textually earlier parts of the text seems to be the advocacy of xenophobia, the divorce of foreign wives, and exile of those who will not divorce. Indeed, those who do not divorce are portrayed as the ancestors of the Samaritans, whom the Jews regarded as unworthy of their religion.

<doc id="7484946" title="Gavin O'Connor (American filmmaker)" nonfiltered="422" processed="418" dbindex="450425">

Gavin O'Connor (born 1964) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, playwright and actor.

O'Connor was born on Long Island, New York. After attending the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, he became interested in all aspects of film production, and in 1992, he wrote and produced Ted Demme's directorial debut, the short film The Bet.  Three years later, he made his own feature film co-writing and directing debut with Comfortably Numb, about the moral dilemmas facing a Connecticut preppie-turned-NYC prosecutor, which failed to garner a wide release after screenings at both the Cannes Film Festival and the Boston Film Festival. He then turned to the stage, producing, writing, and starring in the off-Broadway play Rumblings of a Romance Renaissance in 1997.

At the same time, O'Connor began work on a screenplay based on then-wife Angela Shelton's memories of her childhood spent on the road with her serial-marrying mother. Impressed by Tony Award-winning British actress Janet McTeer's appearance on Charlie Rose's talk show in 1997, he was determined to cast her in what had become Tumbleweeds (in which he co-starred), and he was forced to finance the film himself when potential backers expressed their concern at her relative anonymity in the States. His perseverance paid off - the 1999 film won him the Filmmakers Trophy at the Sundance Film Festival, McTeer's performance earned her a Golden Globe as Best Actress and Academy Award and Screen Actors Guild nominations in the same category, and Kimberly J. Brown, cast as her pre-teen daughter, won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance. O'Connor and Shelton were asked to write a script for the pilot of a TV series based on the film, but nothing ever materialized with the project. The couple divorced shortly afterward.

After executive producing several smaller, independent projects, O'Connor went mainstream in 2004, with Miracle, a film about the United States hockey team's victory in the 1980 Winter Olympics, which he directed for Walt Disney Pictures.

With his twin brother Greg, O'Connor founded Final Cut Features, designed to assist independent filmmakers with post-production financing and services. As either producer or director (or both), he presently is involved in six projects scheduled for release in 2007 and 2008.

<doc id="5572961" title="German 183rd Volksgrenadier Division" nonfiltered="423" processed="419" dbindex="450426">
The 183 Volksgrenadier Division was a German troop during the World War II.

In September 1944 the 183 Volksgrenadier Division was formed of what was left of the 183 Infantry Division, complemented by non-fighting military personnel (from navy and air force) and civilians. The 183rd Infantry Division had come into existence on 15 September 1944, having been formed from the so-called Dollersheim-Schatten-Division of the 31st Wave.
The recruits were often drawn from the local population and therefore had perfect situational awareness of the area they were supposed to defend. Volksgrenadier units were usually not very well trained and were poorly equipped in comparison to regular infantry units. The determination to fight was definitely lower than of the "regular" Army and SS divisions.

At the end of November Grenadier-Regiment 330 was destroyed at Geilenkirchen during a massive allied offensive against the German positions between the rivers Wurm and Rur, between Geilenkirchen and Linnich. Aim of the US Ninth Army was the Rur crossing at Linnich, which would open the way to Cologne. The offensive was called Operation Queen and was launched on November 16th. The 330th Infantry Regiment of the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division was holding the front line near Immendorf, where the American break-in by 406th Infantry Division was launched. During the afternoon 330th Regiment was virtually wiped out, more than five hundred "grenadiers" being captured from the regiment s possible strength of one thousand men. The total killed and wounded could not be estimated but it is believed that not over 250 men remained in the unit.

The offensive would eventually last until mid-December, which the Germans called "the third battle of Aachen" (Dritte Schlacht um Aachen) . In this period the German units in the area counterattacked continuously. By November 21st, after five days of serious combat, the number of casualties within 183 Volksgrenadier Division had risen beyond an acceptable level, and the division was unable to continue fighting as an independent unit. Remaining troops of the 183rd were divided among the other German divisions, the 9 Panzer Division and 15 Panzer Grenadier Division that were present in the area east of Geilenkirchen. 

Organisation.
The 183rd Division included Grenadier Regiments 330, 343 and 351, each of two battalions, as well as Artillery Regiment 219, consisting of four battalions. The composition of the division was enhanced on 19 October 1944 by the absorption of the XVI Landwehr-Festungs-Battalion and Festungs-MG-Battalion 42. Part of the division was made up of raw and ill-trained Austrians.

Commanders.
The 183 Volksgrenadier Division was under command of General-Major Wolfgang Lange since September 15th 1944. Lange also commanded the 49 Infanterie Division during their actions in the battle of Aachen. He received the Knight's Cross (Ritterkreuz) on 14 May 1944. 

On 1 Mai 1945 command of the 183 Volksgrenadier Division was taken over by General-Major Heinrich Warrelmann.

<doc id="326212" title="Ritual purification" nonfiltered="425" processed="421" dbindex="450428">
Ritual purification is a feature of many religions. The aim of these rituals is to remove uncleanliness specifically defined for a particular type of spiritual activity, especially the worship of God. This uncleanliness is not however identical with ordinary physical impurity (like dirt stains). Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease.

In general, all body fluids are considered unclean and some religions have special treatment of semen and menses which are viewed as particularly unclean.

Many religions have a ritual cleansing of the dead before burial.

Some suggested similarities between the cleansing actions engaged in by obsessive compulsive disorder sufferers and those of religious purification rites. The difference is that the first ones indulge in their cleansing without any relation to a particular religious function or a spiritual activity.

Judaism.
See Tevilah.

The Hebrew Bible has many rituals of purification relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, disease, and animal sacrifices. The sacrificial laws were observed by the ancient Israelites. Contemporary Orthodox Jews observe those laws which are not tied to sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem.

Judaism is based on the Hebrew Bible as viewed through the oral law, including the Mishnah and Gemarrah, which together comprise the Talmud, in addition to other rabbinic commentary. Judaism still observes laws concerning ritual purity in regard to sexual relations between married couples. Other ritual purity rules still followed include hand washing for various activities: Upon waking in the morning, before eating a meal, after coming into contact with dead people, and upon leaving the bathroom. The other laws of ritual purity cannot be observed, as they deal with ritual purification connected to the Temple in Jerusalem, which is no longer extant.

Perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of Jewish law are the laws related to toharat ha'mishpach (Hebrew: literally "family purity"). These rules inform us that a woman enters a state of "tameh" when she is menstruating. During this time a couple must refrain from all physical contact, especially sexual relations. After the cessation of her menstrual flow, the woman counts seven days before immersing herself in a mikvah, at which time sexual relations between man and wife can continue. The words "tahor" and "tameh" are often, but erroneously, translated as physically clean and unclean. However, these terms actually describe a state of ritual applicability in regard to fulfilling biblical commandments, such as those associated with the Temple in Jerusalem, the cultic function of Kohanim (priests), and sexual relations within a Jewish marriage. Modern Jewish authors often translate tahor and tameh as "ritually pure" and "ritually impure".

Christianity.
Baptism is a Christian is a form of ritual purification. Catholics and Orthodox Christians are supposed to go to confession, especially before accepting the Eucharist. 

The Church of England's Book of Common Prayer had liturgy for the churching of women adapted from Catholic traditions, which was a thanksgiving and purification event after birth of a child.  Its use is now rare.

Islam.
Islam has rituals of purification including those relating to the preparation for prayer. 
Wudhu the 'minor ablution';
Ghusl the 'major ablution' which includes Wudhu;
Tayammum the 'dry ablution' which is used when clean water is unavailable;

Hinduism.
Various traditions within Hinduism follow different standards of ritual purity and purification and within each tradition the more orthodox follow more strict rules. The most strict rules are prescribed for brahmins, especially those engaged in the temple worship. Smarta attitude is very similar to the Orthodox Jewish one.

Important part of ritual purification is a full bath, best in the running water of a holy river like Ganges, followed by achamana (touching and sipping pure water with recitation of specific mantras) and application of tilaka accompanied by recitation of specific mantras.

In modern times characterized by water pollution one has to be careful while bathing in some rivers, although their ritual cleansing power is not diminished by any physical impurity.

Shinto.
Misogi is a Shinto practice involving purification in a waterfall or other natural running water.

North Germanic tribes are the Germanic tribes that left Scandinavia late on the second phase of the migration period, that took place between AD 500 and 900, and those whose people are still there nowadays. However, some people of East and West Germanic tribes did not migrate with their tribes, staying in Scandinavia, and their East and West Germanic languages evolved into dialects of North Germanic, due to contact with North Germanic tribes and/or cultural assimilation.

Two North Germanic tribes are the Daner (Dani), that gave their name to Denmark, and the Suiones (Svear), that gave their name to Sweden. According to Jordanes, the Dani and the Suiones (named by him Suetidi) were of the same stock.

An example of a West Germanic tribe being culturally assimilated by a North Germanic one, is the assimilation of the  Jutes that hadn't left Jutland and have been incorporated into the Dani. And an example of an East Germanic tribe being assimilated is the assimilation of the Goths that stayed in Sweden by the Suiones.

Today's North Germanic speaking people are the Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Icelanders and Faroese.

The katapayadi sankhya is a way of determining the number of a melakarta ragam from the first two syllables of the name of the raga.



A detailed discussion of the Katapayadi coding scheme and its possible relation to the modern hashing technique was published in the IEEE Annals in a 1997 article, subsequently reprinted elsewhere.  This article, which can be found at:

http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/532626.html

also describes several anecdotal applications of the technique in history, among which is a mnemonic to remember the digits of pi to 17 places.

How to use it.

Following is the Katapayadi sankhya in the Roman alphabet and in Devanagari.

To use the sankhya, take the first two syllables of the name of the ragam, and locate the corresponding columns on the table. Then take the two numbers and reverse them to get the mela number.

Actually, Katapayadi sankhya is a(n) (over-)simplification of ryabhaa's Sanskrit numerals, due probably to Haridatta who lived at Kerala, c. 620-700.

 An Algorithm to derive the Swarasthanas .

Once the mela number is obtained, it is possible to derive the individual Swaras of the ragam. Here is how the SwaraSthanas are derived:

 There is only one Sa in an Octave. so, 'Sa' is fixed.
 'Ri' and 'Ga' notes:
 divide the melakarta number by 36 and note the remainder. The raga will have...
 Ri1 and Ga1 if remainder is less than 7 and greater than 0;
 Ri1 and Ga2 if remainder is less than 13 and greater than 6;
 Ri1 and Ga3 if remainder is less than 19 and greater than 12;
 Ri2 and Ga2 if remainder is less than 25 and greater than 18;
 Ri2 and Ga3 if remainder is less than 31 and greater than 24;
 Ri3 and Ga3 if remainder is either zero or greater than 30;
 Melakartas 1 to 36 use Ma1 (shudhdha madhyamam) while 37 to 72 use Ma2 (prathi madhyamam);
 'Pa' is fixed as well.
 'Da' and 'Ni' notes:
 divide the melakarta number by 6 and note the remainder. The raga will have...
 Da1 and Ni1 if remainder is 1;
 Da1 and Ni2 if remainder is 2;
 Da1 and Ni3 if remainder is 3;
 Da2 and Ni2 if remainder is 4;
 Da2 and Ni3 if remainder is 5;
 Da3 and Ni3 if remainder is 0;

Example:

Lets take the melakarta#29, namely Dheerasankarabharanam. Its Melakarta number is 29. Lets apply the above Algorithm to obtain the swarasthanas of this ragam:

Since we know that 'sa' and 'pa' are fixed, we just need to determine Ri, Ga, Ma, Da and Ni.

Ri and Ga:

When dividing 29 by 36, the Remainder is 29. This is less than 31 and greater than 24. Hence using the above set of rules, we determine that Dheerasankarabharanam has Ri2 and Ga3.

Ma:

Since 29 is less than 37 this raga has Ma1.

Da and Ni:

On dividing 29 by 6 we get 5. This means that this raga has Da2 and Ni3.

To conclude, this raga's scale is: Sa Ri2 Ga3 Ma1 Pa Da2 Ni3 SA.

Thus, we have just derived the entire scale of this raga from its Melakarta number (see Melakarta Table).

Zhang Bao (     ) was the oldest son of Shu Han general Zhang Fei. There is little information on the historical personage, with Chen Shou's San Guo Zhi merely stating that he died prematurely. However, Zhang Bao appears as a fairly prominent character in Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

Zhang Bao's first appearance within the novel was to inform Liu Bei of his father's assassination. It was during this time that he met Guan Xing, second son of Guan Yu, with whom he contested the position of leader of the van. After nearly coming to blows, the two young men were stopped by Liu Bei and made to swear brotherhood to each other. The two were regularly depicted together from that moment onwards.

Zhang Bao was involved in several military campaigns, including Liu Bei's disastrous invasion of Wu and Zhuge Liang's northern campaigns against Wei. In the third campaign, Zhang Bao fell into a gully while pursuing the generals Sun Li and Guo Huai, and died from the resulting injuries. When Zhuge Liang heard of Zhang Bao's death, he was greatly upset, fainting and spewing blood, serving as a prelude to his own eventual death caused by overwork and poor health.

He had one known son, Zhang Zun who died alongside Huang Chong, and Li Qiu defending Mian Zhu from the Wei army.

Ninoy Aquino Day is a public holiday in the Philippines observed annually on August 21. It marks the anniversary of assassination of former Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr. Returning to the Philippines after 3 years of self-imposed exile, Aquino was shot in the head and killed on August 21, 1983 as he was escorted off an airplane by soldiers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Aquino was a staunch opponent of then-President Ferdinand Marcos. Aquino's death sparked anti-Marcos sentiment that led to the 1986 EDSA Revolution.

The holiday was created by Republic Act 9256, which was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on February 25, 2004, the 18th anniversary of the EDSA Revolution. The act was sponsored by Senate President Franklin Drilon and House Speaker Jose de Venecia.

John Rudge was a professional footballer and a football manager. He was born in Wolverhampton in 1939. He managed Port Vale F.C. (1983 1999) and is currently the director of football at Stoke City F.C.

Rudge was manager of Port Vale from 1983 to 1999, where he achieved much success, and is thought of by many as the best ever manager of the club. He took Port Vale up from the old Fourth Division to the First, winning the Autoglass Trophy in 1993 and coming runners-up in the Anglo-Italian Cup. Rudge was also well-known for his talent-spotting ability, bringing players such as Ian Taylor, Gareth Ainsworth and Mark Bright to the club. He snapped up many players as youngsters, and made healthy profits on them in the future, Steve Guppy being a prime example. 

From the mid-to-late 1990s John Rudge had Port Vale playing some of the best football ever witnessed at Vale Park. This was mainly due to his perseverance with playing a standard 4-4-2 - employing wingers who became the focal point of much of the attacking play. Rudge presided over some of the most famous Port Vale victories in their history; defeating the then FA Cup folders Everton in 1997, and knocking Tottenham Hotspur out in the FA Cup Fourth Round in 1988.

Despite his success as Vale manager, every reign must come to an end, and Rudge was controversally dismissed on January 18th 1999 due to the clubs form. This caused outrage amongst Port Vale fans who held a "flat cap protest" (Rudge's headwear of choice) to display their disgust. His successor was Brian Horton.

St. Anne's Well Gardens is a park in Hove, Sussex about half a mile from the shore. The park is renowned for its chalybeate (iron bearing) spring, which is now named St. Anne's Well. 

In this case, the name "St. Anne" does not refer to any saint. Instead, the name was apparently based on a myth of Annafrieda, a Saxon lady whose lover was murdered. Her tears miraculously became the Chalybeate Spring which is now called St. Anne's Well.

Description.
St. Anne's Well Gardens has many native and exotic trees. It also has a scented garden that allow the visitor to experience many different smells. Here is a quote from visitor Hugh Lavelle :
"You enter the garden through an archway, which opens into a square, with a guide rail around the pathway which goes around the centre lawn. The garden is intended for the partial sighted, hence the touchy/feely plants and the scents. I visit here mainly for the peace and quiet, plus when the flowers are out the garden smells lovely.;

St. Anne's Well Gardens has playgrounds for children. Dogs are forbidden in these areas. Lawn bowling ("bowls") has been available since 1925 (membership not required). 

Facilities include: 
 well-stocked fish pond     ;
 sensory garden     ;
 café;
 restrooms     ;
 eight tennis courts  ;
 lawn bowling     ;
 playgrounds     ;
 dog-free areas     ;
 conservation areas;

History.
Early history.
The chalybeate spring in St. Anne's Well Gardens might have been known for many years. The Brighton and Hove government web site notes that the chalybeate spring in St. Anne's Well Gardens was the endpoint of a ley line. 

St. Anne's Well Gardens was part of the Wick Estate in the Middle Ages, which was a strip of land that extended inland to the edge of Preston manor. The Wick Estate was owned by the Stapley family from 1573 until 1701 when it was sold to a family of Brighton brewers, the Scutts. 
Health spa established under the Scutts. 
There was a health spa named the Chalybeate Spa in Hove featuring the St. Anne's Well spring operating as early as the 1700s. At that time, the spring had considerably greater flow than it does at present.
In the 1760s, the Scutts made a number of improvements associated with the spring.
Around 1800 an elaborate "pump room" was built over the spring, housing assorted facilities and accommodating the large numbers who came seeking therapeutic relief at that time. At the pumphouse at the top of the hill in the park, people could drink the brown waters of the spring (at some times of the year, the waters are closer to yellow). 

This area became a popular destination, and some of them came to enjoy the Chalybeate Spa at St. Anne's Well. Many people came to the area to enjoy the shore, and other attractions. There were pleasure gardens at the Georgian and Regency Seaside Resorts in neighboring Brighton at the time. 

In the early 1800s, the Reverend Thomas Scutt redesigned the pump room building. Rev. Scutt added a collonade which was featured in many prints. 

In 1825, Rev. Scutt sold off part of the Wick Estate. This land became the Brunswick Estate.

Goldsmid ownership.
In 1830 the remaining land in the Wick Estate was sold to financier and philanthropist Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, who moved into the Wick Lodge. Sir Isaac Goldsmid was the first to create the gardens that now exist. When Sir. Isaac died in 1859, members of the Goldsmid family that inherited the Goldsmid Estate continued to develop the gardens and surrounding area.

A "Mrs. Fitzherbert" wrote that "....the waters have wonderfully improved my health and strength." after a visit to the Spa in 1830. In 1882 the Brighton Gazette wrote that St. Anne's Well was 'one of the finest springs in Europe'. However, the distance of the Spa from Brighton, competition from other facilities, and a slow decline in the flow of the spring lead to the spa's declining popularity, and it eventually closed. The fields around the spring were dug up to use in the local brick-making business. The places where the mud was removed to make bricks are still visible in the park.

Smith's pleasure gardens.
In 1894 (some sources give a date of 1892), George Albert Smith (1864-1959), a pioneer in the film industry, leased St Ann's Well Gardens from the Goldsmid family. He was devoted to commercially developing the gardens, which he named "St. Anne's Well Pleasure Gardens". Smith's pleasure gardens included novelties such as demonstrations of hot air ballooning and parachute jumps, a monkey house, a fortune teller and a hermit living in a cave. 

In addition, Smith used the pump house as a film laboratory, and produced about 50 short films a year there. Some claim that this was the birthplace of film editing. Later, Smith had a glass house film studio built on the grounds. 

In 1904, A. H. Tee took over the lease on St Anne's Well Gardens from G. Albert Smith, as Smith moved his film businesses to another site.  

Public park.
In 1908, the local authorities bought the gardens for £10,000 and the park was opened to the public on Empire Day in 1908.

There is a clock in front of the old pumphouse, donated by Mrs Flora Sassoon, widow of wealthy business man Sassoon David Sassoon of Ashley Park near Walton, who had relocated to Hove with many other members of the Sassoon family 
In 1913 Mrs. Sassoon also bought and donated the grounds which became the Croquet Lawns (now the lawn bowling facility). She also donated turf and croquet equipment.

Because the spring's flow had slowed, the pump room was demolished in 1935, and a mock wellhead was installed in its place. After the local government bought the park, neighboring buildings like the Grasshopper Cottage, near the bowling green, and the Wick Farmhouse were incorporated into the park, but these were demolished after the second World War. A Swiss chalet-style cafe was a bit rustic, and therefore was replaced by a modern building in the 1970s. These changes were met with some local protest, but to no avail.

<doc id="165704" title="Hells Canyon" nonfiltered="436" processed="432" dbindex="450439">

Hells Canyon is a canyon created by the Snake River.  There is no recognized geographic place called "Hells Canyon." According to a book by R.G. Bailey, titled Hells Canyon, it starts 90 miles (145 km) south of Lewiston, Idaho, and extends 40 miles (64 km) further south to a point near Oxbow, Oregon.  However, some would dispute this definition. The canyon is located within Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.

 General .

In the 1950s the name "Hells Canyon" was borrowed from Hells Canyon Creek, which enters the river near what is now Hells Canyon Dam.  According to Carrey, Conley and Barton in their book, Snake River of Hells Canyon, most of the early explorers referred to the gorge as Box Canyon or Snake River Canyon, though a few locals called it the "Grand Canyon of the Snake." The first reference to Hells Canyon appears in an 1895 edition of McCurdy's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.  In discussing the voyage of the steamboat Norma, the author writes: "She then bounded off, swinging into midstream and, like a racehorse, shot into the Hell Canyon . . .." The name was used by the Mazama Hiking Club in their 1931 bulletin. Bailey's book, Hells Canyon, was published in 1943.  Senator Neuberger of Oregon used it in several publications in the 1950s.  

The Hells Canyon area was once home to Shoshone and Nez Percé Native American tribes.  According to the Nez Percé tribe, Coyote dug the Snake River Canyon in a day to protect the people on the west side of the river from the Seven Devils, a band of evil spirits living in the mountain range to the east.  In the late nineteenth century, the military drove the Native Americans out and settlers began ranching and mining in the canyon.

Hells Canyon is one of the most imposing river gorges in the North American West.  Until a million years ago, the Owyhee Mountains acted as a dam between the Snake River and its current confluence with the Columbia River, creating a vast lake in what is now southwestern Idaho. When the mountains were finally breached, the Snake roared northward, cutting a giant chasm through the volcanic rock. 

Most of the older rocks we see in the canyon came from underwater volcanoes when Hells Canyon's terrains were part of an island arc in the mid-Pacific Ocean. These complex terrains glued themselves to North America about 150 million years ago as a result of tectonic plate movement. Vast areas were later covered with successive lava flows as recently as 6 million years ago. Uplifting from deep in the earth's core formed the Seven Devils and Eagle Cap Mountains, a process that continues today. The canyon itself is a result of both uplifting and erosion. One can see recent basalt flows, limestone formed on the ocean floor, ancient lavas, alluvial deposits, and the remains of primeval swamps that grew on the island surfaces.

The resulting canyon, roughly 10 miles (16 km) across, is not as dramatic as the Grand Canyon. However, when the surrounding peaks are visible from the river, the sense of depth is tremendous. The adjacent ridges average 5,500 feet (1,700 m) above the river.  He Devil Mountain, tallest of the Seven Devils 9,393 ft (2,863 m) towers almost 8,000 ft (2,440 m) above the river, creating the 2nd deepest gorge in the United States according to the Guinness book of world records (after Kings Canyon in California at 8200 ft).  The canyon plunges 7,913 ft (2400 m) from its summit to the mouth of Granite Creek, 6 miles (10 km) away, at 1,480 ft (450 m).

The river is as big as the landscape. Below Hells Canyon Dam, the Snake usually carries more water than the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Below the confluence with the Salmon River, flows average 35,000 ft³/s (990 m³/s) and often peak at three times that rate when the Salmon River is high. Further downstream, the Clearwater River and other rivers dump their flows into the Snake River, creating the Columbia River's largest tributary. (The total drainage area is approximately the size of Oregon.)

Starting at Hells Gate State Park (just outside of Lewiston, Idaho), it is 3 miles (5 km) to Asotin, Washington, 17 miles (27 km) to Buffalo Eddy, 26 miles (42 km) to the Grande Ronde River, 33 miles (53 km) to the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area boundary and the Oregon state line, 45 miles (72 km) to the Salmon River, 48 miles (77 km) to the Imnaha River, 53 miles (85 km) to Dug Bar, 72 miles (116 km) to Pittsburg Landing, 77 miles (124 km) to the Kirkwood Historic Ranch, 86 miles (138 km) to Sheep Creek Ranch, 88 miles (142 km) to Rush Creek Rapids, and 104 miles (167 km) to Hells Canyon Dam. 

Facts.
The Canyon: The Canyon is mostly public land, much of which is designated wilderness. The Canyon is massive, arid, and provides extremely stark, spectacular scenery. Solitude can be hard to find at peak use times; there are numerous jet boats, especially below Rush Creek. The lower river is often crowded on summer weekends. Few roads enter the Canyon, and those that do exist usually require 4-wheel drive.

Drainage Area and Average Annual Discharge: 92,960 square miles (241,000 km²) and 27,500,000 acre-feet (34 km³).

Peak Recorded Flow: 195,000 feet³/second (5,500 m³/s) (June 18, 1974) at Hellers Bar.

Fishing: Fishing is good for trout, bass and catfish. Occasionally, steelhead and salmon are caught, although the fishing for these species is best described as 'fair.' Fishing for the legendary Hells Canyon white sturgeon up to 15 feet (5 m) in length is catch-and-release.

Wildlife: Many Bighorn sheep, ospreys, eagles, chukar partridge, and deer inhabit the canyon. Additionally some turkeys, elk, bears and otters live in the canyon.

Boating Difficulty: Class III-IV. Most of the difficult rapids are at the beginning, then the pace of the trip slows considerably. The two major rapids, Wild Sheep and Granite Creek, should be treated with respect, especially at high flows. At high flows these rapids can easily flip the largest rafts. Those with kayaks and other small boats can portage these rapids. The remainder of the trip, while still offering some exciting rapids, is mostly serene. To avoid the slower water in the lower Canyon, many boaters take out at Pittsburg Landing (mile 32); roughly half of all trips end there.

Trip Length: For those traveling the river, there are variable lengths of trips one can take, depending on taste and choice of shuttles.  Pittsburgh Landing is 32 miles (51 km), Heller Bar is 79 miles (127 km); both have road access.  Other length trips 60 miles (100 km) to the confluence of the Salmon River, 72 miles (116 km) to Cache Creek are possible with a jet boat shuttle.

Boating Season: April - November. Since the dams were built, flows are usually highest in March and April, with the levels gradually dropping into late summer. However, releases fluctuate in order to assist salmon runs. For current information, contact the U.S. Forest Service, or you can call an Idaho Power recording that gives the release from Hells Canyon Dam: (800) 521-9102; in Idaho (800) 422-3143. Releases from Hells Canyon Dam often fluctuate widely, so camp well above river level and tie your boat securely.

Recommended Boating Levels: 5,000 - 40,000 feet³/second (140 to 1,100 m³/s). High water begins around 30,000 ft³/s (850 m³/s).  Skilled boaters can run at higher levels, but the danger increases.  Flows at the put-in vary from 5,000 ft³/s (140 m³/s) to over 50,000 ft³/s (14,000 m³/s) and average roughly 8,000 to 35,000 ft³/s (230 to 1000 m³/s).  At mile 60, the Salmon River adds a significant volume: 50,000 ft³/s (14,000 m³/s) or more in late spring and early summer.  Be warned that strong eddies occur at all flow levels.

Boats: Rafts -- Boats larger than 16 feet (4.9 m) and up at high flows; afternoon upstream winds can be a problem in the flat lower sections. Open Canoes -- Anyone, including experts, should think twice before attempting the big rapids at the start of the run; scouting is a must.

Water: The water is not fit for human consumption. The river gets warm 70 °F (20°C) in summer.

Camping: The dams have trapped sediment and dam releases have eroded the beaches, so much of the camping is on grassy benches above the river. The Salmon River brings in large amounts of sand, beaches -- especially beaches appropriate for large parties -- reappear. There is no camping at the Hells Canyon put-in, and camping is restricted to one night at Granite and Saddle Creeks. Boaters must carry out human waste, and float boaters must show proof of approved receptical prior to launch. Campfires are prohibited year round. Because of fluctuating flows, camp high above the river.

Hiking: Several trails follow the river and climb side creeks (Granite Creek is a favorite).

Enrique Priego Oropeza (Villahermosa, Tabasco) is a Mexican politician of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and former Governor of Tabasco.

His arrival to the Governor of Tabasco occurs after which the Federal Electoral Tribunal annulled the election for Governor and revoked the certainty of majority to the PRI member Manuel Andrade Diaz, who had won after the elections of the October 15, 2000.

Priego - Lopez Conflict.
The cancellation of the elections of Governor took by surprise to the Government in functions, which forced the congress to extraordinary session way to name to that had to take the reins from the state as Temporary Governor before the imminent exit of Madrazo as chief executive, who finished to his term on December 31, 2000.

Article 47 of the constitution of the state says the following thing: 

In the case of absolute lack of the Governor, happened in both first years of the respective period, if the Congress is in sessions, it will be elevated immediately in Electoral School and concurring at least the two third parts of the total number of his members, will name, in secret scrutiny and by absolute majority of votes, to a temporary Governor. 

The same Congress, will send within the five following days to the one of the designation of temporary Governor, the call for the election of Governor who must conclude the respective period; having to mediate between the date of the call and the one that is indicated to carry out elections, greater a nonsmaller term of three months nor of six. 

If the Congress will not be in sessions, the Permanent Commission will name, of course, to a provisional Governor and will summon to extraordinary sessions the Congress so that this one designates to the temporary Governor and sends the call for the election of Governor in the terms of the previous paragraph. 

When the lack of Governor happened after the second year of the respective period, if the Congress were in sessions will designate to the Governing Substitute that will have to conclude the period. If the Congress will not be reunited, the Permanent Commission will name a Governor provisional and will summon the Congress to Extraordinary Sessions so that it is elevated in Electoral School and it makes the designation of substitute Governor.

Taking as it bases the article, on December 31, 2000, the parliamentary group of the PRI of the 56 legislature (and that stopped that same day) it designated to the federal deputy without license, Enrique Priego Oropeza, as Temporary Governor. Act that was described like as legislative Dawn attack on the part of the PRD. 

The PRD opposed the designation arguing that on December 31, 2000 was no absolute lack of governor, because Madrazo still was in functions and that in any case, would have to be the 57 legislature, same that entered functions the January 1, 2001 (the same day which the new governor) the one that he designated as Temporary Governor. 

Under this argument, the legislators of PRD, PAN, PT and two of the PRI designated to the then Secretary General of the PRI, Adán Augusto López, as Temporary Governor, untying with it a postelectoral conflict without precedents in the state and the country: There were two governors in functions in a state. After political negotiations and several rinsings, the partisan forces agreed and Enrique Priego Oropeza assumed the interinato and summoned to new elections on August 5, 2001.

The Tyasmyn () is a river, a right tributary of the Dnieper River, in Ukraine. The Tyasmyn takes its source in the north central part of the Dnieper hills in the central Ukrainian province of Kirovohrad. From there it flows through the Cherkasy Oblast, where it finally flows into the Kremenchuk Reservoir. The river forms a u-turn (180°) in its central run. Not counting the river's sharp turn, the river delta, and the river's source (from snow thaw) are located only 33 km away from each other. 

In the river's lower flow, there are important discovery sites of the Belogrudovka/Cernoles Culture in proximity of the settlement of Subotiv. These findings represent a key place for the late Bronze Age.

Cities and towns located on the river include: Kamyanka, Smila, and Chyhyryn.

The Latok group is a small cluster of dramatic rock peaks in the Panmah Muztagh, part of the central Karakoram mountain range. They lie just to the east of the Ogre group, dominated by Baintha Brakk. To the immediate south of the Latok group lies the Baintha Lukpar Glacier, a small tributary of the Biafo Glacier, one of the main glaciers of the Karakoram. On the north side of the group lies the Choktoi Glacier. 

The group comprises four main summits, each listed here with its relative position in the group, elevation, and first ascent date:
 Latok I, north-central, 7,145 m, climbed 1979;
 Latok II, west, 7,108 m, climbed 1977;
 Latok III, east, 6,949 m, climbed 1979;
 Latok IV, southeast, 6,456 m, climbed 1980;
All of the summits are notable for their extreme technical difficulty, and they have been the scene of some of the hardest climbing done at high altitude anywhere in the world.

Latok I was first climbed in 1979 by a Japanese expedition led by Naoki Takada; the first summit party comprised Sin'e Matsumi, Tsuneo Shigehiro, Yu Watanabe, and they were followed three days later by Hideo Muto, Jun'ichi Oku, and Kota Endo. They started from the Baintha Lukpar Glacier and climbed a buttress to reach the East Ridge. 

The steep North Ridge of Latok I, 2,500 m (8,200 ft) high, is a notorious unclimbed route: it was first attempted, and almost successfully climbed, by the noted American climbers Jim Donini, Michael Kennedy, George Lowe, and Jeff Lowe. The lightweight style of this climb was widely admired, despite the lack of a summit. Many unsuccessful attempts have followed.

Latok II saw its first ascent in 1977, by an Italian group led by Arturo Bergameschi. (This was the first successful ascent in the group.) They climbed the southeast face of the peak, and E. Alimonta, T. Mase, and R. Valentini made the summit.

A notable recent ascent of Latok II came in 1997, when a very strong team composed of Alexander Huber, Thomas Huber, Toni Gutsch, and Conrad Anker climbed the sheer West Face of the peak. They described this aptly as putting "El Capitan on top of Denali": a 1,000 m (3,280 ft) vertical rock wall with a base at 6,100 m (20,000 ft) elevation. The total vertical for the climb was 2,200 m (7,200 ft). 

The first ascent of Latok III came in 1979, when a Japanese team under the leadership of Yoji Teranishi climbed the Southwest Ridge route. They climbed the Southwest Ridge, and the summit party were Teranishi, Kazushige Takami, and Sakae Mori. The second ascent, via the same route, came in 1988, by an Italian party. This was in fact the first repeat ascent of any peak in the group.

Treeflower is a background character on the animated Nickelodeon show, The Angry Beavers.



Description.

Treeflowers character is one who is unsure. She is a teenage girl, who is changes her image numerous amount of times. Treeflower is possibly trying to fit in with people in her life, and is always trying her best to please them. Only one thing stays certian about the characters personality, though. She loves music.

Relationship With Norbert.

Treeflower was the love of Norberts life when she was first intoduced to the show. They met at a hippie concert where she headed a folk rock band called "The Friendly Chartreuse Bubblegum Machine". The two then fell in love. (See Bummer of Love episode.) 

Though when Norbert saw Treeflower again, he expected their romance to continue, but she was a different person. No longer a hippie, she now wrote elevator music for a living. She also was not interested in Norbert anymore, she fell for Truckee, a truck-driving shrew. But to Treeflower's disappointment, Truckee didn't have the same feelings for Treeflower. After Norbert tried to comfort the heartbroken Treeflower, she said to him "No matter what happens, I'll always be your friend."  Which left Norbert still feeling loved. (See Tree of Hearts episode.)

Notes.

 She teamed up with Muscular Beaver in the episode Muscular Beaver 3. Her superhero name was The Goody Good Gal.

 Creators have made refernces to the bands Iron Butterfly and The Who around her character.

 The name Treeflower is a reference to when hippies would name their children outrageous names, like Moonbeam or Rainbow.

<doc id="1587109" title="Ilario Pantano" nonfiltered="452" processed="448" dbindex="450455">

Ilario Pantano (born 1971 in New York City) is a former United States Marine Corps second lieutenant who was accused of premeditated murder in the killing of two Iraqi civilians on April 15, 2004. A military tribunal exonerated Pantano, who maintained he had shot the men as they approached him in a threatening fashion. He was cleared of all charges, and forensic evidence from an autopsy of the Iraqis supported Pantano's version of the events.  The government's sole witness, Sgt. Daniel Coburn, a member of Pantano's platoon, testified that Lt. Pantano shot the two Iraqis in the back, but recanted this testimony on the witness stand.

Biography.
Pantano was born in New York City and grew up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. His father was an Italian-born tour guide and his mother was a Kansas native who is now a literary agent.

Pantano attended the private high school school Horace Mann in New York, on scholarship. Following graduation he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and participated in the first Gulf War as a TOW gunner. Pantano completed Scout Sniper training, and was promoted to sergeant, remaining in the Marine Corps until 1993.

 Return to civilian life .
Following his return to civilian life, Pantano earned an economics degree from New York University. He built a successful career as an energy trader for Goldman Sachs, and moved on to become a movie producer with a New York firm called The Shooting Gallery. He would later be a cofounder of a company specializing in interactive television, Filter Media. Pantano married Jill Chapman, a fashion model, who had appeared in Italian Vogue. The couple would later have two children.

 Rejoins the USMC .
Immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Pantano decided to rejoin the Marines. Pantano's apartment was next to a fire station where eleven firemen, four of whom were former Marines, perished in the 9/11 attacks.

He was accepted as an officer candidate, and after completing Officer Candidate School was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, at the age of thirty.

He was a popular officer and his superiors described him as the best platoon commander in his battalion. His men reported that they appreciated the extra training drills he put them through.

 Return to Iraq, 2004 .
Pantano went to Iraq in February of 2004 with 2nd Battalion 2nd Marines. This was quickly followed by the intense fighting in Fallujah during Operation Vigilant Resolve in April 2004.  On April 15, 2004, acting on intelligence extracted from captured opposition fighters, Lieutenant Pantano led his platoon against a compound near the town of Mahmudiyah.

 April 15th incident .
As the platoon approached the compound, they saw a vehicle with two Iraqis in it. Pantano ordered his men to stop the vehicle and to have the occupants of the vehicle handcuffed. The vehicle was searched for weapons. Lieutenant Pantano remained with the captives, while the rest of his platoon secured the compound. The compound was deserted, but his men found a cache of arms, including "several mortar aiming stakes, a flare gun, three AK47 rifles, 10 AK magazines with assault vests and IED making material."

When Pantano learned that the compound contained weapons, he ordered Sergeant Daniel Coburn and Corpsman George Gobles to watch for enemies. He then released the captives from their bonds. According to a statement Lieutenant Pantano made to military investigators in June 2004, he then used hand signals to order the captives to search the vehicle again. According to Pantano, during the search of the vehicle he felt the Iraqis posed a threat to him. They were talking, and Pantano believed they were conspiring together. When they both turned to face each other, he shouted "Stop!" in both Arabic and English, and when they did not, he shot them. After emptying his magazine, he continued to fire. He later stated: "I then changed magazines and continued to fire until the second magazine was empty...I had made a decision that when I was firing I was going to send a message to these Iraqis and others that when we say, 'No better friend, No worse enemy,' we mean it. I had fired both magazines into the men, hitting them with about 80 percent of my rounds."

Indictment.
In June 2004, Sergeant Coburn registered a complaint about the incident, triggering a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe.  

On February 1, 2005, Pantano was charged with two counts of premeditated murder, and faced the death penalty if convicted.

 Article 32 hearing .
On April 14, 2005, Pantano tried to waive his right to an Article 32 pretrial hearing, in an effort to speed the process toward a court martial. Pantano claimed that the government was withholding key evidence and witnesses and according to a statement made by his mother, waived his right to a hearing "in order to get a Military Judge to compel the prosecution to produce witnesses and evidence in his case."  The military denied this request and the Article 32 hearing was held on April 26, 2005 with Major Mark Winn as the presiding officer.

 Autopsy report .
Prior to Pantano's Article 32 hearing the Department of Defense had maintained that it was impossible to do a post-mortem examination on the corpses of Lieutenant Pantano's captives because they were buried in a cemetery that was in an area that was not under American control. However, shortly before the hearing, the bodies were exhumed after all. The autopsy report was released the day after the Article 32 recommendation was made and, according to the Washington Times, supported Lt. Pantano's version of events.

Pantano's statements.
Pantano acknowledged leaving a sign on a car above the corpses that said, "No better friend, No worse enemy," but then returned to remove it after one of his colleagues called it 'inappropriate'. This phrase is the motto of his Marine Corps battalion, and is promoted by his battalion commander as the combat philosophy of their unit. The slogan is also a popular Marine saying popularized by Lieutenant General James Mattis, then commanding general of the 1st Marine Division.

In an interview with the BBC from March 20, 2005, Lieutenant Pantano said, "I'm a New Yorker and 9/11 was a pretty significant event for me, our duty as Marines is, quite frankly, to export violence to the four corners of the globe, to make sure that this doesn't happen again."

Witnesses.
Medical corpsman George Goble was present but did not witness the danger Lieutenant Pantano reported, because he was looking outwards, as ordered. He later stated when he turned back he saw the Iraqis trying to run away.  

Sergeant Coburn is reported to have said "As soon as I turned my back, Lt. Pantano opened  with approximately 45 rounds."  Coburn, throughout the case, gave five distinctly separate versions of events. Lieutenant Pantano's defense counsels have said they believe that Sergeant Daniel Coburn's account should not be given any credit, because he was disgruntled, having been demoted recently by Pantano.

Another witness, "Corporal 'O'", was an Arabic-speaking Nigerian-American in Pantano's platoon. His full name was kept confidential at Pantano's hearing because he is being trained for counter-intelligence duties.

In his testimony at Pantano's hearing, Corporal "O" described interviewing the two captives. He described seeing the vehicle being searched by other Marines, including the removal of its seats. He described seeing the corpses of the captives, following the shooting, face down, with the heads and torsos in the vehicle and their knees resting on the ground, as if Pantano shot the captives in the back while they were kneeling facing the vehicle. Corporal "O" described the sight as "weird".

Sergeant Coburn was heavily criticized for some interviews he had given (he was under a gag order) as well as untruths concerning the evidence in the case.

Coburn's internet statements.
The blogosphere also played a major role. Coburn made remarks on Euphoric Reality during the case that were in direct contradiction of his statements to naval investigators. The blog owner turned in the comments to Pantano's attorney, who confronted Coburn on the stand with his own remarks in a dramatic cross-examination that resulted in Coburn being taken off the stand and read his Miranda rights. Coburn returned to the stand the following day after being granted immunity.

Another Marine officer, Lt. Graham Hopkins, was a classmate of Pantano's during Officer Candidate School. Hopkins was slated to testify for the prosecution as a character witness against Pantano, and his testimony included anecdotes about Pantano's personality and leadership style while in training. However, Hopkins was not allowed to testify after he and his mother were found making the same type of comments as Coburn on military blogs covering the case.  Hopkins' own record was also called into question, as his overall leadership ranking during officer school was last in the class of 192 students.  Pantano was ranked fifth.

Recommendations.
Major Winn recommended to Major General Huck, commander of Lieutenant Pantano's division that the murder charges be dropped.  It was his assessment that Sergeant Coburn was an uncredible witness. He did however recommend that Pantano receive nonjudicial punishment for conduct unbecoming an officer, for the sign he left on the corpses. He described Lieutenant Pantano's treatment of his captive's corpses as a "desecration".

Under U.S. military law, the decision as to whether a court martial should take place lay solely with the General commanding Lieutenant Pantano's division. And he decided to dismiss all charges. As a result of this decision, Lieutenant Pantano's case was not referred to a court-martial for a determination of his guilt or innocence.

 Website, internet threats .
On February 12, 2005, Lieutenant Pantano's mother appeared on CNN to publicize his case, and to tell the public about the site she founded for his defense.
The website created by Pantano's mother reported that that the Iraqis had advanced on him in a threatening manner, that he had ordered them to stop, and fired on them, in self-defense when they failed to do so. Prior to the press finding access to Lieutenant Pantano's statement, journalists and bloggers sympathetic to Pantano echoed the version on his mother's website.

On February 17, 2005, it was reported that Ms. Pantano's site went down, and a parallel site with a similar name went up. It was reported that the parallel site contained threats against Pantano, and his family; that it contained a video simulating Pantano being decapitated. Retired Marines are reported to have volunteered to stand a security watch over Pantano's home.

 Autobiography .
On June 12, 2006, Pantano's autobiographical account of his experiences, Warlord: No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy, was released by Threshold Editions, Mary Matalin's Simon & Schuster imprint.  On July 10, 2006, he appeared as a guest on The Daily Show to promote the book.

The State Line Mob operated in the 1950's and 1960's at the Mississippi-Tennessee state line in Alcorn County, Mississippi and McNairy County, Tennessee along U.S. Highway 45. The State Line Mob were criminals enterprised in bootlegging, gambling, prostitution, tourist fleecing, robbery, and murder. Many of the prestige members came from Phenix City, Alabama after martial law was called and the U.S. Army cleaned the city up and rid the city, which also sat on a state line (Alabama-Georgia). 

The State Line Mob owned and operated motels, restaurants, and clubs at the Mississippi-Tennessee state line. The establishments were centers for every form of vice. Establishments such as motels, restaurants, and truckstops were also operated in the southern portion of Alcorn County, just south of Corinth, Mississippi. The establishments help bring hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal moonshine and taxed whiskey.

The establishments were owned and operated by Jack and Louise Hathcock, Carl Douglas "Towhead" White, W.O. Hathcock.

In the Year of the Pig is a 1968 documentary film about the origins of the Vietnam War, directed by Emile de Antonio. It was nominated for an Academy award for best documentary.

The film, which is in black and white, contains much historical footage and many interviews.  Those interviewed include Harry S. Ashmore, Daniel Berrigan, Philippe Devillers, David Halberstam, Roger Hillsman, Jean Lacouture, Kenneth P. Landon, Thruston B. Morton, Paul Mus, Charlton Osburn, Harrison Salisbury, Ilya Todd, John Toller, David K. Tuck, David Werfel, and John White.

Produced at the height of the Vietnam War, the film was greeted with hostility by many audiences, with bomb threats and vandalism directed at theaters that showed it. 

De Antonio cites the film as his personal favorite.  It features the ironic use of patriotic music, portrays Ho Chi Minh as a patriot to the Vietnamese people, and asserts that Vietnam was always a single country rather than two.

"C-note" redirects here. For the Prison Break character, see Benjamin Miles "C-Note" Franklin. The musical pitch of C is described in the article Note.;



The United States one hundred-dollar bill ($100) is a denomination of United States currency.  U.S. statesman, inventor, and diplomat Benjamin Franklin is currently featured on the obverse of the bill, while Independence Hall is featured on the reverse. The bill is one of two current notes that does not feature a President of the United States. It is the largest denomination that has been in circulation since July 14, 1969, when the higher denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and $100,000 were retired. 

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing says the "average life" of a $100 bill in circulation is 60 months before it is replaced due to wear.  Approximately 7% of all notes produced today are $100 bills.

One-hundred dollar bills are delivered by Federal Reserve Banks in mustard-colored straps.

Large size note history.
(approximately 7.4218 × 3.125 in   189 × 79 mm)

1861: Three-year 10 dollar Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 7.3% interest per year.  These notes were not primarily designed to circulate, and were payable to the original purchaser of the dollar bill.  The obverse of the note featured a portrait of General Winfield Scott.
1862: The first $100 United States Note was issued with a Bald Eagle on the left side of the obverse. Two different variations of this note were issued that resulted in slightly different wording (obligations) on the reverse; the note was issued again in series of 1863.
1863: Both one and two year Interest Bearing Notes were issued that paid 5% interest. The one-year Interest Bearing Notes featured a vignette of George Washington in the center, and allegorical figures representing "The Guardian" to the right and "Justice" to the left .  The two-year notes featured a vignette of the U.S. treasury building in the center, a farmer and mechanic to the left, and sailors firing a cannon to the right.
1863: The first $100 Gold Certificates were issued with a Bald Eagle to the left and large green 100 in the middle of the obverse.  The reverse was distinctly printed in orange instead of green like all other U.S. federal  government issued notes of the time.
1864: Compound Interest Treasury Notes were issued that were intended to circulate for three years and paid 6% interest compounded semi-annually. The obverse is similar to the 1863 one-year Interest Bearing Note.

1869: A new $100 United States Note was issued with a portrait of Abraham Lincoln on the left of the obverse and an allegorical figure representing architecture on the right.  Although this note is technically a United States Note, TREASURY NOTE appeared on it instead of UNITED STATES NOTE.
1870: A new $100 Gold Certificate with a portrait of Thomas Hart Benton on the left side of the obverse was issued. The note was one-sided.
1870: One hundred dollar National Gold Bank Notes were issued specifically for payment in gold coin by participating national gold banks. The obverse featured vignettes of Perry leaving the USS St. Lawrence and an allegorical figure to the right; the reverse featured a vignette of U.S. gold coins.
1875: The reverse of the series of 1869 United States Note was redesigned. Also, TREASURY NOTE was changed to UNITED STATES NOTE on the obverse.  This note was issued again in series of 1878 and 1880.
1878: The first $100 Silver Certificate was issued with a portrait of James Monroe on the left side of the obverse.  The reverse was printed in black ink, unlike any other U.S. Federal Government issued dollar bill.
1882: A new and revised $100 Gold Certificate was issued. The obverse was partially the same as the series 1870 gold certificate; the border design, portrait of Thomas H. Benton, and large word GOLD, and gold-colored ink behind the serial numbers were all retained.  The reverse featured a perched Bald Eagle and the Roman numeral for 100, C.
1890: One hundred dollar Treasury or "Coin Notes" were issued for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The note featured a portrait of Admiral David G. Farragut.  The note was also nicknamed a "watermelon note" because of the watermelon-shaped 0's in the large numeral 100 on the reverse; the large numeral 100 was surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.
1891: The reverse of the series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too "busy" which would make it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design.
1891: The obverse of the $100 Silver Certificate was slightly revised with some aspects of the design changed. The reverse was completely redesigned and also began to be printed in green ink.
1914: The first $100 Federal Reserve Note was issued with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and allegorical figures representing labor, plenty, America, peace, and commerce on the reverse.
1922: The series of 1880 Gold Certificate was re-issued with an obligation to the right of the  bottom-left serial number on the obverse.

Small size note history.
(6.14 × 2.61 in   156 × 66 mm)

1929: Under series of 1928, all U.S. currency was changed to its current size and began to carry a standardized design. All variations of the $100 bill would carry the same portrait of Benjamin Franklin, same border design on the obverse, and the same reverse with a vignette of Independence Hall. The $100 bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Note with a green seal and serial numbers and as a Gold Certificate with a golden seal and serial numbers.
1933: As an emergency response to the Great Depression, additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes issued under series of 1929. This was the only small-sized $100 bill that had a slightly different border design on the obverse. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.
1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the gold standard.
1934: Special $100 Gold Certificates were issued for non-public, Federal Reserve bank-to-bank transactions.  These notes featured a reverse printed in orange instead of green like all other small-sized notes.  The wording on the obverse was also changed to ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GOLD PAYABLE TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND AS AUTHORIZED BY LAW.
1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $100 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray numeral 100, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve Seal had spikes added around it.
1966: Because dollars bills were no longer redeemable in silver, WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND was removed from the obverse of the series 1963 A $100 Federal Reserve Note. The obligation was also changed to its current wording,THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. IN GOD WE TRUST was added to the reverse.

1966: The first and only small-sized $100 United States Note was issued with a red seal and serial numbers. It was the first of all United States currency to use the new U.S. treasury seal with wording in English instead of Latin.  Like the series 1963 $2 and $5 United States Notes, it lacked WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND on the obverse and featured the motto IN GOD WE TRUST on the reverse. The $100 United States Note was issued due to legislation that specified a certain dollar amount of United States Notes that were to remain in circulation. Because the $2 and $5 United States Notes were soon to be discontinued, the dollar amount of United States Notes would drop, thus warranting the issuing of this note.
1991: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced under series 1990 with microscopic printing around Franklin's portrait and a metallic security strip on the left side of the bill.
March 25, 1996: The first major design change in numerous years took place with the adoption of a contemporary style layout.  The main intent of the new design was to deter counterfeiting.  New security features included a watermark of Franklin to the right side of the bill, optically variable ink (known as O.V.I) that changed from green to black when viewed at different angles, a higher quality and enlarged portrait of Franklin, and hard-to-reproduce fine line printing around Franklin's portrait and Independence Hall.  Older security features such as interwoven red and blue silk fibers, microprinting, and a metallic security thread were kept.  The individual Federal Reserve Bank Seal was changed to a unified Federal Reserve Seal along with an additional prefix letter being added to the serial number.
Near future: The $100 bill is expected to receive design changes analogous to the current $20 bill, $50 bill, and newly released $10 bill. According to the Associated Press, the new $100 bills will be released after the re-designed $5 bills in 2008.  Although the redesign has been publicized as routine, North Korean counterfeiting operations are a major concern.;

Nicknames.

The $100 bill has many nicknames including:
C-note, from the Roman numeral C for 100, although this usage is far less common today than it was in the early 20th century;
C-B, from the Roman numeral C for 100, and B for Bill;
Franklin, Benjamin, Ben, Benjy or Benny because of Benjamin Franklin's portrait.
Texas Penny, similar to other American sayings where "Texas" is used as a synonym for big, Texas-sized.
Hunsky, Hundy, Hundo, Hunj or Hundi, all variations on "hundred".

"I've Got a Feeling" is a song by The Beatles, from the 1970 album Let It Be. It is actually a combination of two unfinished songs strung together: Paul McCartney's "I've Got a Feeling" and John Lennon's "Everybody Had a Hard Year", with the main guitar riff coming from Lennon's unfinished "Watching Rainbows". McCartney's song was written for his girlfriend Linda Eastman, whom he soon married, telling her that she was the girl he had always been looking for. Lennon's song was a litany where every line started with the word "everybody".

While McCartney's song was very optimistic, Lennon had actually had a hard year - he had divorced his wife, Cynthia Powell, he was estranged from his son Julian Lennon, his girlfriend Yoko Ono had a miscarriage, he was arrested for drug possession, and his money was dwindling.

In the film Let It Be, Lennon claims he wrote "Everybody Had a Hard Year" the night before. 

The song was covered by Yukio Tanaka, a character in the 2004 Japanese Anime & Manga, Beck.

Pearl Jam covered the song and it is featured on the "covering" bootleg album, the band covered the song around 25 times from 1991 to 1994.

Ángel de Villafañe (c.1504-?), the Spanish conquistador of Florida, Mexico, and Guatemala,

was an explorer, expedition leader, and ship captain (with Hernán Cortés), who worked with many 16th-century settlements and shipwrecks along the Gulf of Mexico.

 Life and work .
Ángel de Villafañe was born about 1504, as the son of Juan de Villafañe and Catalina de Valdés, both natives of León, Castile (Spain), who had served Ferdinand and Isabella. In 1513, at age nine, young Angel accompanied his father in the fleet of Pedrarias Dávila to Darién.





In 1523, Villafañe went to Pánuco in the company of Francisco de Garay. With Garay thwarted in his plans to establish a colony by Hernán Cortés, Villafañe instead joined the Cortés faction and sailed to Mexico City.

In Mexico City, Angel de Villafañe married Doña Ynés de Caravajal, a relative of Pedro de Alvarado, the famous conquistador (second in command to Hernán Cortés and governor of Guatemala). Angel de Villafañe became known as "one of the principal caballeros" of that city, and both he and his wife were recognized as "gentle people, hidalgos, and of great fortune."

Villafañe participated in the conquest of Michoacán and Colima, and he also helped subdue the Chontal Mayas, the Zapotecs, and the Mixes. For his actions, he was awarded an encomienda at Xaltepec. He then participated in the pacification of Jaliscos and, as a ship captain, in Cortés's exploration of the Pacific coast.

In 1553, Villafañe became entangled in a political struggle, after acting on the viceroy's orders to arrest the king's inspector, Diego Ramírez. Caught between the viceroy and the royal audiencia, he sought to extricate himself by sending a letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles I of Spain.



His letter was transported in April 1554 on the ship San Andrés, the only ship of the four sailing at that time to make port. The other three ships were wrecked by a hurricane (1554)

along the coast of Padre Island, in future Texas. In early June, when word of the disaster reached Mexico City, the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent Villafañe marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels.

Villafañe traveled to Pánuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site, which had already been visited from that community. He arrived in time to greet García de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado), commander of the salvage operation, when Alvarado arrived by sea on July 22, 1554. The team labored until September 12 to salvage the Padre Island treasure.



This loss, in combination with other ship disasters around the Gulf of Mexico, gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern Gulf Coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways. As a result, the expedition of Tristán de Luna y Arellano was sent and landed at Pensacola Bay on August 15, 1559.

Angel de Villafañe was involved in the Luna expedition from the start. Before it sailed, he took charge of the encampment at Jalapa, while Luna himself traveled to Veracruz to complete arrangements for the voyage. Afterward, commanding the San Juan de Ulúa garrison stationed at Veracruz, Villafañe was able to monitor the operation and report back to the viceroy, Luis de Velasco. 

Over a year later, when Luna proved incapable of managing the settlements at Florida and Santa Elena, Viceroy Velasco then sent Villafañe to replace him.
Tristán de Luna y Arellano had suffered disease, in trying to relocate the Ochuse settlement decimated by the hurricane of September 19, 1559, and most native food (corn, beans, pumpkins) was also depleted.  Villafañe reached the Ochuse (Pensacola) settlement in early March 1561, and on April 9, he assumed authority as governor of both "provinces of La Florida and Punta de Santa Elena" in replacing Luna.

Leaving 50 men at Ochuse, Villafañe sailed the rest of the colony (about 230 persons) to Santa Elena (Georgia near South Carolina). After several landings along the Carolina coast, while seeking a suitable port, the fleet was struck by another hurricane, but some ships survived.

Villafañe sailed his storm-battered fleet to Hispaniola, and then to Havana, Cuba, where many of his soldiers scattered. After three months in Cuba, Villafañe returned to Ochuse (Pensacola Bay) to remove the remaining 50 men of the colony, sailing back to Mexico.

Along with other participants in the Florida / Santa Elena attempt, Villafañe was summoned by Viceroy Velasco to offer advice on future settlements. The conferees concluded a negative assessment of settlements on both the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast. Future efforts on the Atlantic seaboard were to be made from Spain, and no new enterprise was undertaken on the northern Gulf shore until after the landing of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in Texas, more than a century later.

A record of Villafañe's death has not been found.

This article is an overview of the subject. For a more technical discussion and for information related to current research, see Entropy (arrow of time).;



In the natural sciences, arrow of time, or time s arrow, is a term coined in 1927 by British astronomer Arthur Eddington used to distinguish a direction of time on a four-dimensional relativistic map of the world; which, according to Eddington, can be determined by a study of organizations of atoms, molecules, and bodies.  

Physical processes at the microscopic level are either entirely or mostly time symmetric, meaning that the theoretical statements that describe them remain true if the direction of time is reversed; yet when we describe things at the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or flow) of time.  An arrow of time is anything that exhibits such time-asymmetry.

History of term.
From the 1928 book The Nature of the Physical World, which helped to popularize the term, Eddington states: 

Let us draw an arrow arbitrarily.  If as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world, then the arrow is pointing towards the future; if the random element decreases the arrow points towards the past.  That is the only distinction known to physics.  This follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone.  I shall use the phrase  time s arrow  to express this one-way property of time which has no analogue in space.

Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow:

It is vividly recognized by consciousness.
It is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty, which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical.
It makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals.

Here, according to Eddington, the arrow indicates the direction of progressive increase of the random element.  Following a lengthy argument into the nature of thermodynamics, Eddington concludes that in so far as physics is concerned time's arrow is a property of entropy alone.

 Overview .
The symmetry of time (T-symmetry) can be understood by a simple analogy: if time were perfectly symmetric then it would be possible to watch a movie taken of real events and everything that happens in the movie would seem realistic whether it was played forwards or backwards.

For example, a movie showing a cup falling off a table seems realistic when run forwards, but seems unrealistic if run backwards. On the other hand, a movie of the planets orbiting the sun would look equally realistic run forwards or backwards; either way the orbital motions would appear to conform to physical laws.

 An example of irreversibility .

Consider the situation in which a large container is filled with two separated liquids, for example a dye on one side and water on the other. With no barrier between the two liquids, the random jostling of their molecules will result in them becoming more mixed as time passes. However, if the dye and water are mixed then one does not expect them to separate out again when left to themselves.  A movie of the mixing would seem realistic when played forwards, but unrealistic when played backwards.

If the large container is observed early on in the mixing process, it might be found to be only partially mixed. It would be reasonable to conclude that, without outside intervention, the liquid reached this state because it was more ordered in the past, when there was greater separation, and will be more disordered, or mixed, in the future.

Now imagine that the experiment is repeated, this time with only a few molecules, perhaps ten, in a very small container. One can easily imagine that by watching the random jostling of the molecules it might occur   by chance alone   that the molecules became neatly segregated, with all dye molecules on one side and all water molecules on the other. That this can be expected to occur from time to time can be concluded from the fluctuation theorem; thus it is not impossible for the molecules to segregate themselves. However, for a large numbers of molecules it is so unlikely that one would have to wait, on average, longer than the age of the universe for it to occur. Thus a movie that showed a large number of molecules segregating themselves as described above would appear unrealistic and one would be inclined to say that the movie was being played in reverse.

 Arrows .
 The thermodynamic arrow of time .

The thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that in an isolated system entropy will only increase with time; it will not decrease with time.  Entropy can be thought of as a measure of ; thus the Second Law implies that time is asymmetrical with respect to the amount of order in an isolated system: as time increases, a system will always become more disordered. This asymmetry can be used empirically to distinguish between future and past.

The Second Law does not hold with strict universality: any system can fluctuate to a state of lower entropy (see the Poincaré recurrence theorem). However, the Second Law seems accurately to describe the overall trend in real systems toward higher entropy.

This arrow of time seems to be related to all other arrows of time and arguably underlies some of them, with the exception of the weak arrow of time (see below).

 The cosmological arrow of time .

The cosmological arrow of time points in the direction of the universe's expansion.  It may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow, with the universe heading towards a heat death (Big Chill) as the amount of usable energy becomes negligible. Alternatively, it may be an artifact of our place in the universe's evolution (see the Anthropic bias), with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a Big Crunch.

If this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time, then the future is by definition the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger. Thus, the universe expands - rather than shrinks - by definition.

 The radiative arrow of time .
Waves, from radio waves to sound waves to those on a pond from throwing a stone, expand outward from their source, even though the wave equations allow for solutions of convergent waves as well as radiative ones.  This arrow has been reversed in carefully worked experiments which have created convergent waves, so this arrow probably follows from the thermodynamic arrow in that meeting the conditions to produce a convergent wave requires more order than the conditions for a radiative wave. Put differently, the probability for initial conditions that produce a convergent wave is much lower than the probability for initial conditions that produce a radiative wave. In fact, normally a radiative wave increases entropy, while a convergent wave decreases it, making the latter contradictory to the Second Law of Thermodynamics in usual circumstances.

 The causal arrow of time .
Causes are ordinarily thought to precede effects.  The future can be controlled, but not the past.

A problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that, as David Hume pointed out, the causal relation per se cannot be perceived; one only perceives sequences of events.  Furthermore it is surprisingly difficult to provide a clear explanation of what the terms "cause" and "effect" really mean.  It does seem evident that dropping the plate is the cause, the plate shattering is the effect.  However, it may be that the asymmetry that the observer relies upon in such cases is really the thermodynamic one. If the thermodynamic arrow were reversed then one would regard the gathering shards as the cause and the fused plate jumping up into our hands as the effect.

 The weak arrow of time .
Certain subatomic interactions involving the weak nuclear force violate the conservation of parity, but only very rarely.  According to the CPT Theorem, this means they should also be time irreversible, and so establish an arrow of time. Such processes should be responsible for matter creation in the early universe.

This arrow is not linked to any other arrow by any proposed mechanism, and if it would have pointed to the opposite time direction, the only difference would have been that our universe would be made of anti-matter rather than from matter. More accurately, the definitions of matter and anti-matter would just be reversed.

That parity is broken so rarely means that this arrow only "barely" points in one direction, setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious.

 The quantum arrow of time .
According the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, quantum evolution is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which is time-symmetric, and by wave function collapse, which is time irreversible. As the mechanism of wave function collapse is still obscure, it's not known how this arrow links to the others.  While at the microscopic level, collapse seems to show no favor to increasing or decreasing entropy, some believe there is a bias which shows up on macroscopic scales as the thermodynamic arrow. According to the theory of quantum decoherence, and assuming that the wave function collapse is merely apparent, the quantum arrow of time is a consequence of the thermodynamic arrow of time (also see Entropy (arrow of time)).

 The psychological/perceptual arrow of time .

Psychological time is, in part, the cataloguing of ever increasing items of memory from continuous changes in perception.  In other words, things we remember make up the past, while the future consists of those events that cannot be remembered.  The ancient method of comparing unique events to generalized repeating events such as the apparent movement of the sun, moon, and stars provided a convenient grid work to accomplish this. The consistent increase in memory volume creates one mental arrow of time. Another arises because one has the sense that one's perception is a continuous movement from the unknown (Future) to the known (Past). Anticipating the unknown forms the psychological future which always seems to be something one is moving towards, but, like a projection in a mirror, it makes what is actually already a part of memory, such as desires, dreams, and hopes, seem ahead of the observer.

Even the association of (behind = past) and (ahead = future) may be culturally conditioned. It was reported during 2006 that the Aymara people associated (ahead = past) and (behind = future).

The psychological arrow of time is thought to be reducible to the thermodynamic arrow: it has deep connections with Maxwell's demon and the physics of information; In fact, it is easy to understand its link to the Second Law of Thermodynamics if we view memory as correlation between brain cells (or computer bits) and the outer world. Since the Second Law of Thermodynamics is equivalent to the growth with time of such correlations, then it states that memory will be created as we move towards the future (rather than towards the past).

The other side of the psychological passage of time is in the realm of volition and action. We plan and often execute actions intended to affect the course of events in the future. Hardly anyone tries to change past events. Indeed, in the Rubaiyat it is written (sic): 
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
  Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
  Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
- Omar Khayyám (Fitzgerald translation)

On the personal level, the process of aging is more than just the accumulation of memories, but, historically, there has been more hope of reversing aging than of time travel or of reversing the arrow of time. See Fountain of youth.

<doc id="5857154" title="Appeasement of Hitler" nonfiltered="466" processed="462" dbindex="450469">

The most well-known case of appeasement is one which ultimately failed   the appeasement of Adolf Hitler by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's government in the late 1930s. The Munich Agreement in particular stands as a major example of appeasement.  There is, however, a large historiographical debate about appeasement.

Reasons why the British government appeased Hitler.

 The Communist threat. Conservative politicians had to worry not only about the threat posed by Hitler's Germany, but also about the threat posed by the Stalinist Soviet Union   as the Holocaust had not yet occurred, they mostly regarded Stalin as the greater of the two totalitarian evils.  The fact that the United States was at the time in an extremely isolationist phase made the situation even more difficult.  They feared that as Britain and France were busy fighting Germany in the West, the Soviets would invade Poland and then eastern Germany.  After the "War of German Suppression", Germans and Allies alike would be at the mercy of the Soviet Union, essentially "1945 without the United States or the atomic bomb".

 Failure to recognise the dangers of Nazism.  Winston Churchill was leader of the minority that recognised the military threat posed by a rearmed Germany.  Even if a 1938 war against Germany was won, the most likely regime to replace the Nazis would be a military dictatorship.  Alternatively, a post-Nazi Germany could have swung leftward, forcing the Western democracies to fight a German-Soviet alliance.

  Mistaken presumption that Hitler was a rational actor.  Like many other dictators, diplomats of the time operated under the assumption that the Nazi Party, and Hitler, were rational actors who would stop when their defined goals were achieved. They believed Hitler could be reasoned with and would stop his aggressive tactics and become peaceful once the unfair sections of Versailles was sorted out. The failure of this assumption led to containment policies by anti-Communist nations during the Cold War.

 Perceived flaws of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles imposed many restrictions on internal German affairs, which were later on widely viewed by the Allied nations as being unfair to Germany.  Many people argued that German rearmament, the reoccupation of the Rhineland and the acquisition of the Saarland were merely examples of the Germans taking back what was rightfully theirs.  They also believed that since Versailles had created the states of Poland and Czechoslovakia on the basis of self-determination, it was unjust to deny the opportunity of Austrians and Sudetenlanders to join Germany if they so wished.  Because Hitler had not taken any obviously non-German territory as of 1938, a war launched by the Allies at this stage would have been a war launched merely on the basis of suspicion, in which Britain would be deeply divided.  This could have been fatal if the war had gone badly for the Allies   as indeed happened in 1940.  By 1939 Hitler had annexed the very non-German city of Prague   meaning that self-determination could no longer be used to justify his actions.  This made a decision to go to war in 1939 far easier than in 1938.

  The Economic Impact of World War I. The national debt of Britain increased tenfold during the war, and the increase of British government debt to foreign governments during WWI, mainly to America, led to a high interest rate being charged. The British government therefore had to try to cut back on spending, and the public would not stomach cutting back on domestic spending. The Geddes Committee of 1921 22 recommended that the armed forces and weapons be reduced, but this would eventually lead to a time delay when it came to rearmament during the 1930s. The price of rearming would have a crippling effect on the British government, and so the avoidance of war was a sound economic policy. Besides, one can argue that it was not until the post-war period, after the large scale centralisation of the government, that the British civil service was really capable of raising, allocating and taxing the funds required of the large scale spending that would be necessary to rearm effectively.

Peace for our time.



Chamberlain's peace for our time deal (i.e. the surrender of the Sudetenland to Germany) with Hitler was internationally acclaimed and praised at home and abroad, by among others Pope Pius XI, Ireland's Eamon de Valera, the United States administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Canada's Mackenzie King. Chamberlain was acclaimed by many British people for avoiding another war. He was greeted by cheering crowds on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, alongside King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, who themselves supported his policy, both having lost friends and relatives in the last war.

A voice condemning the Agreement came in the publication that very  same day of the best-selling Penguin Special Europe  and  the Czechs by S. Grant Duff, a copy of which was delivered to each member of Parliament. As the publishers state, the volume was written at their request and was completed as late as the first week of September, and sold in the hundreds of thousands of copies.

The Munich Agreement marked the high tide of appeasement but was also the turning point in British public opinion. Many regarded the surrender of Czechoslovakia, the only remaining democracy in central Europe, with disgust   especially as it had a well-armed and trained army. The Labour Party, which until relatively recently had been condemning the Tories for their bellicosity, now attacked the appeasers as the "Men of Munich" and switched firmly into the pro-war camp.

Origins of the concept of the Western Betrayal.

The Czechoslovak leaders and the population believed that if Germany attacked, France would meet its treaty obligation to Czechoslovakia and attack Germany. They also believed that Britain   which unlike France had no treaty obligation to Czechoslovakia   would be drawn in, too. The Soviet Union also had a treaty obligation to come to the aid of Czechoslovakia   if France did. There was no question of America acting, as far as Jan Masaryk, the son of the first Czechoslovak President, professor Tomá¨ Garrigue Masaryk, was concerned.

It is when viewed against this background that the rationale and impact of Chamberlain's agreement with Hitler takes on less than desirable and laudable characteristic:

On September 27, 1938, when negotiations between Hitler and Chamberlain were strained, the British Prime Minister addressed the British people . At the heart of why his critics view his policy as well-meaning but ultimately wrong  is this sentence from that speech: "How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing."

A mere 20 years before Chamberlain addressed the British people regarding his agreement with Hitler, WWI ended in The Treaty of Versailles . Czechoslovakia was one of the original members of the League of Nations signatories of the Versailles treaty of peace. Part I, Articles 27 30, addresses the Boundaries of Germany. Part III, Political Clauses for Europe, Section VII, of that treaty addresses the Czecho-Slovak State. Yet, Chamberlain characterised the Czechs and the Germans as "people of whom we know nothing".

The peoples whose fate was being decided in Munich were not invited to the negotiating table. O nás bez nás (about us without us) became a phrase bitterly remembered by all Czechs and Slovaks. Neither were the peoples whose fates were being decided invited to the Yalta Conference in 1945.

Hopes were expressed by Milan Ekert, Czech PES Group Observer, Member of the European integration Committee in 2003: "'Without us, but about us'   this sentence describes the history of the Czech Republic, where a succession of larger powers have taken decisions about us, without us. After enlargement, however, all of this change . For the first time in our history, we can decide for ourselves. And only because of this, is it worth joining the EU."

Chamberlain and rearmament.

However, many of those that had been in government during the First World War were haunted by its effect and were determined to avoid any war in the future. Deeming all war "futile", Chamberlain himself and his ministers were also aware of the lack of military capacity at their disposal. Part of that was the result of the belief subscribed to by many governing elites in the 1920s and early 1930s that war would no longer be an option and that military budgets could be tailored accordingly. The European cycle of wars, which in the previous seventy years had produced two massive conflicts, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the First World War (or Great War as it was then called), was thought to mark the end of old-style European conflicts. This was partly because of:

 the horrors of 1914 18 that were thought to haunt all Europeans;
 the disappearance of old militarist monarchies like the Hohenzollern monarchy of Prussia and Germany and the old system of secretive military alliances (the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance);
 the apparent democratisation of Europe which it was thought would mean that war could not be waged without the will of the people, and after 1918 that will would no longer be there;
 and as a result of the financial burdens fighting the Great War and rebuilding states afterwards had imposed on individual exchequers.

In addition, the apearance of the League of Nations raised hope that there would now be other ways of resolving interstate disputes than military might. Because of this the old cycle of rearming for the next revenge conflict was thought to be broken. The Great Depression after 1929 forced governments to cut expenditures.  In such circumstances, a heavily funded military was thought neither politically possible nor financially viable. 
Faced with the growing political and economic instability in Europe, the rise in Nazism and the increased irrelevance of the League of Nations as a means to deal with disputes, Britain engaged in one of the most massive military build-ups in modern history and instituted a peacetime draft. The rearmament budget of 1937 amounted to £1.5 billion.

Wayne Mansfield, of Perth in Western Australia, was the head of direct marketing business T3 Direct Marketing, operating under a series of two-dollar companies, and in 2005 became the first Australian to be prosecuted for email spamming.

Mansfield was a junk faxer in the mid-1990s before turning to spamming, in which he promoted seminar-hosting companies he ran, including The Maverick Partnership and Business Seminars Australia.  These messages admitted he had harvested emails from "various publicly available sources and other marketing promotions", but included instructions for recipients to unsubscribe from the list.

T3 Direct was blacklisted along with the company in June 2002 by the Spam Prevention Early Warning System (SPEWS), along with its ISP, Swiftel (now People Telecom).  Swiftel suspended T3 Direct's online access for this, and also violation of its terms of service.  T3 Direct was left with AU$4,578 in charges outstanding to Swiftel.  However, Mansfield insisted that it was the other arm of his business, concerned with web design and the management of opt-in databases, which suffered as a result.

In July of the same year, Mansfield began legal action against Perth technician and anti-spam campaigner Joey McNicol.  After receiving spam from Mansfield and discovering that the unsubscribe option did not work, and that contact details in the messages were fake, McNicol had set up a website publishing the details of T3 Direct and other Mansfield companies, as well as publishing these details in newsgroups.  Mansfield accused McNicol of sending his company's IP address to SPEWS, prompting the blacklisting, but lost the case as he was unable to prove McNicol had actually contacted SPEWS, and in any case the action was not ruled to be illegal.  Although Mansfield's company was ordered to pay McNicol's costs in the action, Mansfield shut down that company without paying those costs and continued business using a new company. McNicol's legal fees were in part paid by donations.  

Proceedings under the Spam Act of 2003.

In June 2005 the then Australian Communications Authority (ACA) (Now known as the Australian Communications & Media Authority - ACMA) brought proceedings against Mansfield and his new company, Clarity1, under the recently-passed Spam Act 2003 where ACMA alleged that they were involved in the sending of 56 million spam emails during 2004.  He however insisted that sending commercial emails was his "right", but claimed he had not harvested any new email addresses since the Spam Act came into force, arguing that because he had started spamming the recipients before the Spam Act and the recipients had not unsubscribed, he could infer consent (an argument that did not find favor with the Court).  He also stated that telephone operators at his company had been subjected to abuse by irate callers, but promised that unsubcribe requests were handled "within minutes".  He defended his campaign, citing 20,000 attendees at his business seminars.  
.

ACMA's complaint in this matter was upheld in the Australia Federal Court on 13 April 2006. The Court imposed a penalty of AU$4.5million on Clarity1, and AU$1million on Wayne Mansfield, on 27 October 2006.

Plot.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are going on vacation, and they ask SpongeBob and Patrick to look after the Mermalair. They want to play with the super-gadgets, but are told that they can't. They're wandering around when they find Man Ray (a villain) stuck in a prison of frozen tartar sauce. Patrick unleashes him, and they try to teach him how to be good. He has a tickle-belt (as seen in Mermaidman & Barnacleboy Episode 17!), a device that tickles the owner when a button is pressed. He pretends he is good, in order to get the belt off.  Goodness Lesson # 1 - "You see someone drop his wallet. What do you do?" Man Ray acts polite, and hands the wallet to Patrick, but he says it's not his wallet. After a few moments, Man Ray gets angry with Patrick, and threatens to rip his arms off if he doesn't take the wallet. As a result, SpongeBob is forced to tickle him.  Goodness Lesson # 2 - "You see someone struggling with a heavy package. What do you do?" Man Ray offers help, but Patrick drops the box on Man Ray's foot, hurting him. After dropping the box repeatedly, Man Ray asks Patrick what's in the box. Patrick answers my wallet, and Man Ray starts beating Patrick up. SpongeBob tickles him, but Man Ray still continues to beat him up. Manray claims the tickle punishment is worth it (as a tradeoff to hurt Patrick). Goodness Lesson # 3 - SpongeBob is about to say something when Patrick, angry, with bandages, a head injury and on a wheelchair, takes control of the lesson and says, "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. What is it?" Man Ray answers 62. Patrick says it's wrong and tickles Man Ray. SpongeBob and Patrick fight for the remote, and it breaks, so Man Ray is doomed to laugh for eternity unless someone removes the belt. Man Ray says please while telling them to remove it, so they do.  Man Ray steals the Aqua Glove and the Squid Ink Bomb and turns SpongeBob and Patrick into dust. SpongeBob and Patrick change into Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy outfits, making them "ManSponge" and "Boy Patrick" again, respectively. They catch up with Man Ray and turn on the Orb of Confusion (An orb which if turned on, makes every living creature within a certain radius semi-conscious and confused. The radius can be seen because the water surrounding it becomes distorted) to confuse Man Ray, but they are the ones who get confused. Man Ray tries to rob a bank, but he can still feel the belt's tickle even though he isn't wearing it. He decides to open an account instead. Man Ray passes the place where SpongeBob and Patrick are. He turns the orb off and gives SpongeBob his evil head. However, Patrick is still confused...

DeBary is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,559 at the 2000 census. As of 2004, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau is 16,211.  DeBary is a residential and retirement community.

History.

The Timucuan Indians once lived in the vicinity of Lake Monroe, where the domain of Chief Utina extended to just north of Lake George.  They hunted, fished and gathered plants and berries from the forest.  By 1760, however, the Timucua had disappeared and been replaced by the Seminole tribe from Alabama and Georgia.  Florida was acquired from Spain in 1821, but the Seminole Wars would delay settlement.  In 1866, Elijah Watson of Enterprise sold land to Oliver and Amanda Arnett on the northern shore of the St. Johns River at Lake Monroe, where they built a house.  

The couple in turn sold 400 acres in 1871 to (Samuel) Frederick deBary, a wealthy wine merchant from New York City, and that same year he erected a hunting lodge.  Called "DeBary Hall," the 8,000 square foot, 20 room Italianate mansion featured a two-tiered veranda, stables, an ice-house and the state's first swimming pool, fed by a spring.  Visitors included President Ulysses S. Grant and President Grover Cleveland.  Over time he acquired an additional 9,000 acres, planting orange groves and pecan trees.


In 1875, deBary bought a small steamboat, the George M. Bird, to transport his horses and dogs along the St. Johns River for hunting expeditions, and also to take fruit to market.  He established the DeBary Merchants' Line in 1876, a steamship service contracted to carry mail between Jacksonville and Enterprise.  It would acquire the sidewheeler Frederick DeBary.  In 1883, the firm merged with the Baya Line, owned by Colonel H.T. Baya, to create the DeBary-Baya Merchants' Line, with 13 steamboats and a crew of 3,000 running to Sanford.  The DeBary-Baya Merchants' Line sold its business in 1889 to the Clyde Line, which survived until 1928. 

Frederick deBary died in 1898, and his mansion is today a restored museum, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  The estate, reduced to 10 acres, now features the community's oldest building, the Arnett House.  Incorporated in 1993, the City of DeBary is named for its noted settler.

<doc id="9062" title="Daoud's Republic of Afghanistan" nonfiltered="477" processed="473" dbindex="450480">


Daoud's Republic (July 17, 1973 - April 28, 1978)
The welcome Mohammed Daoud Khan received on returning to power on
July 17, 1973 reflected the citizenry's disappointment with the
lackluster politics of the preceding decade. Zahir Shah's "New Democracy" had promised much but had delivered little. Daoud's comeback was a return to traditional strongman rule and he was a particularly appealing figure to military officers. As prime minister, Daoud had obtained large supplies of modern arms from the Soviet Union and he had been a former army officer himself. Also, his strong position on the Pashtunistan issue had not been forgotten by conservative Pashtun officers.

Daoud discussed rebellion for more than a year with various opposition elements - both moderates and leftists, including military officers who were members of both the Khalqi and
Parchami factions of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. Certainly the communists had worked vigorously to undermine Zahir Shah's experiment in
constitutional democracy. Their inflammatory speeches in
parliament and organized street riots were tactics which alarmed
Zahir to the degree that he refused to sign the law legalizing
political parties. Babrak Karmal's Parcham faction became integrally
involved in planning the coup. There is general agreement that
Daoud had been meeting with what he called various "friends" for
more than a year. The coup itself was carried out by junior
officers trained in the Soviet Union. Some Afghans suspected that
Daoud and Karmal had been in touch for many years and that Daoud
had used him as an informant on the leftist movement. No strong
link can be cited to support this, however, other than the
closeness between Karmal's father, an army general, and Daoud. At
the time of the July 1973 coup, which took place when the king
was in Italy receiving eye treatment at the medicinal mud baths
at Ischia, it was sometimes difficult to assess the
factional and party affiliation of the officers who took place.
Despite a number of conversions of Parchamis to the Khalqi
faction by the time of the communist coup of April 1978 which
overthrew Daoud, both party and factional loyalties became
obvious after the PDPA took power.

Although leftists had played a central role in the coup, and
despite the appointment of two leftists as ministers, evidence
suggests that the coup was Daoud's alone. Officers personally
loyal to him were placed in key positions while young Parchamis
were sent to the provinces, probably to get them out of Kabul,
until Daoud had purged the leftist officers by the end of 1975.

The next year, Daoud established his own political party, the
National Revolutionary Party, which became the focus of all
political activity. In January 1977, a loya jirga approved
Daoud's constitution establishing a presidential, one party
system of government.

Any resistance to the new regime was suppressed. A coup attempt by Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal, which may have been planned before Daoud took power, was subdued shortly after his coup. In October 1973, Maiwandwal, a former prime minister and a highly respected former diplomat, died in prison at a time when Parchamis controlled the Ministry of Interior under circumstances corroborating the widespread belief that he had been tortured to death.

While both of the PDPA's factions had attempted to collaborate
with Daoud before the 1973 coup, Parcham used its advantage to
recruit on an unprecedented scale immediately following the coup.
Daoud, however, soon made it clear that he was no front man and
that he had not adopted the claims of any ideological faction. He
began in the first months of his regime to ease Parcharmis out of
his cabinet. Perhaps not to alienate the Soviet Union, Daoud was
careful to cite inefficiency and not ideological reasons for the
dismissals. Khalq, seeing an opportunity to make some short-term
gains at Parcham's expense, suggested to Daoud that "honest"
Khalqis replace corrupt Parchamis. Daoud, wary of ideologues,
ignored this offer.

Daoud's ties with the Soviet Union, like his relations with
Afghan communists, deteriorated during his five year presidency.
This loosening of ties with the Soviet Union was gradual. Daoud's
shift to the right and realignment made the Soviets anxious but
western observers noted that Daoud remained solicitous of Soviet
interests and Afghanistan's representative in the United Nations
voted regularly with the Soviet Bloc or with the group of
nonaligned countries. The Soviets remained by far Afghanistan's
largest aid donor and were influential enough to insist that no
Western activity, economic or otherwise, be permitted in northern
Afghanistan.

Daoud still favored a state-centered economy, and, three years
after coming to power, he drew up an ambitious seven-year
economic plan (1976 - 1983) that included major projects and required
a substantial influx of foreign aid. As early as 1974, Daoud
began distancing himself from over-reliance on the Soviet Union
for military and economic support. That same year, he formed a
military training program with India, and opened talks with Iran
on economic development aid. Daoud also turned to other oil-rich
Muslim nations, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait, for
financial assistance.

Pashtunistan zealots confidently expected the new president to
raise this issue with Pakistan, and in the first few months of
the new regime, bilateral relations were poor. Efforts by Iran
and the United States to cool a tense situation succeeded after a
time, and by 1977 relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan had
notably improved. During Daoud's March 1978 visit to Islamabad,
an agreement was reached whereby President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of
Pakistan released Pashtun and Baloch militants from prison in
exchange for Daoud withdrawing support for these groups and
expelling Pashtun and Baloch militants taking refuge in
Afghanistan.

Daoud's initial visit to the Soviet Union in 1974 was
friendly, despite disagreement on the Pashtunistan issue. By the
time of Daoud's second visit in April 1977, the Soviets knew of
his purge of the left begun in 1975, his removal of Soviet
advisers from some Afghan military units, and his changes in
military training whereby other nations, especially India and
Egypt, trained Afghans with Soviet weapons. Despite official
goodwill, unofficial reports circulated of sharp Soviet criticism
of anticommunists in Daoud's new cabinet, of his failure to
cooperate with the PDPA, and of his criticism of Cuba's role in
the non-aligned movement. Furthermore, Daoud was friendly with
Iran and Saudi Arabia, and he had scheduled a visit to Washington, DC
for the spring of 1978.

By 1978 Daoud had achieved little of what he had set out to
accomplish. Despite good harvests in 1973 and subsequent years,
no real economic progress had been made, and the Afghan standard
of living had not improved. By the spring of 1978, he had
alienated most key political groups by gathering power into his
own hands and refusing to tolerate dissent. Although Muslim
fundamentalists had been the object of repression as early as 1974, their numbers had nonetheless increased. Diehard
Pashtunistan supporters were disillusioned with Daoud's
rapprochement with Pakistan, especially by what they regarded as
his commitment in the 1977 agreement not to aid Pashtun militants
in Pakistan.

Most ominous for Daoud were developments among Afghan
communists. In March 1977, despite reaching a fragile agreement
on reunification, Parcham and Khalq remained mutually suspicious.
The military arms of each faction were not coordinated because,
by this time, Khalqi military officers vastly outnumbered
Parchami officers and feared the latter might inform Daoud of
this, raising his suspicion that a coup was imminent. Although
plans for a coup had long been discussed, according to a
statement by Hafizullah Amin, the April 1978 coup was implemented
about two years ahead of time.

The April 19, 1978, funeral for Mir Akbar Khyber, a prominent
Parchami ideologue who had been murdered, served as a rallying
point for Afghan communists. An estimated 10,000 to 30,000
persons gathered to hear stirring speeches by Nur Mohammed Taraki and Karmal. Shocked by this demonstration of communist unity, Daoud ordered
the arrest of PDPA leaders, but he reacted too slowly. It took
him a week to arrest Taraki, and Amin was merely placed under
house arrest. According to later PDPA writings, Amin sent
complete orders for the coup from his home while it was under
armed guard using his family as messengers. The army had been put
on alert on April 26 because of a presumed "anti-Islamic" coup.
Given Daoud's repressive and suspicious mood, officers known to
have differed with Daoud, even those without PDPA ties or with
only tenuous connections to the communists, moved hastily to
prevent their own downfall.

April Coup.
On April 27, 1978, a coup d'état beginning with troop
movements at the military base at Kabul International Airport,
gained ground slowly over the next twenty-four hours as rebels
battled units loyal to Daoud in and around the capital. Daoud and
most of his family were shot in the Presidential Palace the
following day. Two hundred and thirty-one years of royal and then republican rule by Ahmad Shah and his descendants had ended and the period
of the communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan had began.

Hadal zone (or Hadopelagic zone) is the delineation for the deepest trenches in the ocean. This zone is found from a depth of around 6000m (19,700 ft) to the bottom of the ocean.  Hadal  is a French word meaning  house of the dead.   Hadal  is in turn from the Greek god Hades who is the god of the dead and his domain.

 Conditions .
In 1960, Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh reached the Marianas Trench, the deepest trench on Earth, and observed living life. It is believed that most life at this depth is sustained by Marine snow or the chemical reactions around thermal vents. The creatures that exist off of the thermal vents are called thermophiles and live at the base of submarine volcanoes. The lack of light and intense pressure create hostile living conditions, and species that have habituated adapt to these conditions. 
No sunlight reaches this layer of the ocean. Deep-sea creatures have adapted to this with reduced eyesight, having very large eyes for receiving only bioluminscent flashes. Most of the bottom dwelling creatures lack any pigmentation, appearing red due to blood showing through the skin, since coloration is not necessary in an environment with no light.
The pressure here can reach over 1100 atmospheres (about 16,200 psi). Creatures removed from this zone will die in the lower-pressure areas above.;
The most common creatures include jellyfish, viperfish, tube worms, and the deep sea angler fish.;

In the United Kingdom general election of 2005, numerous minor or single issue candidates stood for election. Due to the first past the post electoral system, national fourth parties are rarely successful in achieving representation in the House of Commons. A notable exception is the case of regional parties, such as the Scottish National Party or Plaid Cymru, who have gained a number of seats.

The impact of minor parties should not be underestimated. The success of the Green Party in the 1980s led to environmentalism becoming a key issue for the three main parties, while the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) is now one of the largest British parties in the Europe Parliament and has greatly advanced the issue of euroscepticism.

Parties listed below are organised firstly by the nations and regions in which they are standing, then the number of MPs elected in the 2001 general election, then by number of candidates standing in the 2005 election, and finally alphabetically.  As a result, parties attracting more support will tend to appear higher in each list than fringe parties.

 Parties standing in England and Wales .
There are well over 500 seats in England and Wales, with the Labour Party and Conservative Party standing in every one, and the Liberal Democrats standing aside only against Health Concern.

The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) is a once prolific rocket and nuclear reactor test facility located 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, California. SSFL continues to operate today, serving as a research facility for The Boeing Company. The first commercial nuclear-power producing reactor inside the United States was built at SSFL. The reactor powered over 1,100 homes in the Moorpark area of California for a short period of time. SSFL, however, also became home to the first meltdown of a power-producing reactor in the United States on July 26, 1959. Today, all nuclear research and most rocket testing has been halted. 

Various research initiatives, such as the development of the Saturn rockets that powered the Apollo missions, the rockets that powered the vast ballistic missile arsenal of the United States during the Cold War years, and even a program to develop nuclear reactors for use in outer space were undertaken at the facility, which still remains widely unknown to the public.






 History .
Founded in the mid-1940s, SSFL was slated as a United States government facility dedicated to the development and testing of nuclear reactors, powerful rockets like the Delta II, and the systems that powered the Apollo missions. The location of SSFL was chosen for its remoteness in order to conduct work that was considered too dangerous to be performed in more densely populated areas. In subsequent years however, Southern California s population mushroomed. Today, more than 150,000 people live within 5 miles of the facility, and at least half a million people live within 10 miles. (see: Boeing, Site Environmental Report for Calendar Year 2005, September 2006, p. 5-22;)

At a size of 2,850 acres (11 km²), SSFL is situated on top of the Simi Hills, overlooking Simi Valley to the north, Chatsworth, Canoga Park, and the West Hills areas of the San Fernando Valley a densly populated area on the northernmost border of Los Angeles' city limits to the south.

The site is divided into four areas, (area I, II, III, IV). Areas I through III were used for rocket testing, missile testing, and munitions development. Area IV was used primarily for nuclear reactor experimentation and development. Star Wars laser research, also known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was also conducted in Area IV.

Throughout the years, approximately ten nuclear reactors operated at SSFL in addition to several  critical facilities  (low power reactors); a sodium burn pit in which sodium coated objects were burned in an open pit; a plutonium fuel fabrication facility; a uranium carbide fuel fabrication facility; and  purportedly the largest  Hot Lab  facility in the United States at the time (a Hot Lab is a facility used for remotely cutting up irradiated nuclear fuel). Irradiated nuclear fuel from other Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Department of Energy (DOE) facilities from around the country were shipped to SSFL to be decladed and examined.

The Hot Lab suffered a number of fires involving radioactive materials. For example, in 1957, a fire in the Hot Cell  got out of control and . . . massive contamination" resulted. (see: NAA-SR-1941, Sodium Graphite Reactor, Quarterly Progress Report, January-March 1957). Another radioactive fire occurred in 1971, involving combustible primary reactor coolant (NaK) contaminated with mixed fission products. (see: Rockwell International, Nuclear Operations at Rockwell s Santa Susana Field Laboratory  A Factual Perspective, September 6, 1991).

At least four of the ten nuclear reactors suffered accidents. The AE6 reactor experienced a release of fission gases in March of 1959, the SRE experienced a power excursion and partial meltdown in July 1959, the SNAP8ER in 1964 experienced damage to 80% of its fuel, and the SNAP8DR in 1969 experienced similar damage to a third of its fuel. (see "reactor accident sources" below).

Unfortunately,the reactors located on the grounds of SSFL were considered experimental, and therefore had no containment structures. Reactors and highly radioactive components were housed without the large concrete domes surrounding modern power reactors.

The most famous incident occurred on July 26 1959. On that summer day, the Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) suffered a power excursion when power production from the reactor rose out of control. With significant effort, the reactor was shut down. However, a few hours later it was restarted without the cause of the incident having been determined. The reactor continued to operate for several more weeks with high radiation readings and other signs of problems until it was shut down at the end of the month. 

After a full shut down was completed, the reactor operators discovered that a significant fraction of the fuel had suffered melting. Tetralin, a coolant used for the pump seals, had leaked into the sodium coolant of the reactor. Carbonaceous material formed, blocking the coolant channels and preventing the sodium coolant from reaching the reactor core, which in turn caused the fuel to overheat and melt. 

Approximately one-third of the fuel experienced melting. 

Radioactive gases were released from the reactor into holding tanks and then bled into the atmosphere over a period of weeks. The extent of the radioactive releases remains uncertain to this date, but estimates put the amount from 260 to 459 times the amount of radiation that was released at the Three Mile Island facility. Some monitors went off scale; but few measurements of the sodium coolant were taken. Later, the few measurements that were taken emerged to be contradictory. However, the ratios of volatile radionuclides found in the coolant suggested significant releases of radioactivity into the environment may have occurred.

The 1959 SRE incident is the most well known accident to occur at the facility (In 2006, The History Channel did a piece on the SRE accident, see: "Modern Marvels, Engineering Disasters 19"). However, the plutonium fuel fabrication facility and the Hot Laboratory (which handled highly irradiated reactor fuel from much larger reactors shipped in from the AEC/DOE nuclear complex) possibly had more serious accidents. However, virtually nothing about their accident histories are publicly known.

The sodium burn pit, an open-air pit for cleaning sodium-contaminated components, was also contaminated when radioactively and chemically-contaminated items were burned in it, in contravention of safety requirements. In an article in the Ventura County Star, James Palmer, a former SSFL worker was interviewed. The article notes that "of the 27 men on Palmer's crew, 22 died of cancers." On some nights Palmer returned home from work and kissed "his  hello, only to burn her lips with the chemicals he had breathed at work." The report also noted that "During their breaks, Palmer's crew would fish in one of three ponds. . . . The men would use a solution that was 90 percent hydrogen peroxide to neutralize the contamination. Sometimes, the water was so polluted it bubbled. The fish died off." Palmer's interview ended on a somber note: "They had seven wells up there, water wells, and every damn one of them was contaminated," Palmer said, "It was a horror story." (see: The Cancer Effect, October 30, 2006, The Ventura County Star.)

On December 11, 2002, a top Department of Energy (DOE) official, Mike Lopez, described the typical clean-up procedures executed by Field Lab employees. Workers would dispose of barrels filled with highly toxic waste by shooting the barrels with shotguns so that they would explode and release their contents into the air. This procedure survived until the mid 1990s when two employees were killed by a barrel that exploded after they shot it.

Other spills and releases occurred over the decades of operation as well. In 1989, a DOE investigation found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination on the property. Widely publicized in the local press, the revelations led to substantial concern among community members and elected officials, resulting in a challenge to and subsequent shutdown of continued nuclear activity at the site, and the filing of lawsuits. Cleanup commenced, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was brought in at the request of local legislators to provide oversight.

In 2005, wildfires swept through northern Los Angeles County and parts of Ventura County. The fires consumed most of the dry brush throughout the Simi Hills where SSFL is located. Substantial fire damage was done to the facility. Since the fire, allegations have emerged that vast quantities of on-site contamination was burned up, and released into the air. Most recently, Los Angeles County firefighters who were assigned to SSFL during the fire have been sent for medical testing to see if any harmful doses were ingested or inhaled while protecting the facility.

While community members and firefighters have expressed concern about the amount of exposure, Boeing officials stand by their position that no contamination of the air resulted from the fire, and that any contamination that may have been consumed by the fire was negligible.

California's Department of Toxic Substances Control also claims that no significant contamination occurred as a result of the fire. Although the Field Lab is under current criticism for violating almost 50 discharge permits, State agencies have been silent on the issue. Recently, lawyers disclosed to the California Water Resources Control Board that over 80 exceedances of Boeing's discharge permits were found in the past year alone. In January of 2006, the State Water Resources Control Board finally stepped in, and refused some requests by Boeing for even lighter standards.

Also in October of 2005, a Plaintiff in a suit against Boeing criticized her attorneys, who, as she claimed, accepted a $30 million dollar settlement with Boeing without her approval. The attorneys stand to collect $18 million, or 60% of the settlement amount after their costs and fees are subtracted. The Plaintiff who disclosed the allegedly tainted deal is splitting the rest of the settlement with other plaintiffs and will only receive around $30,000, a far cry from the amount she will need for extensive future medical treatments for diseases that were linked to contamination from the SSFL facility.

In October of 2006, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory Advisory Panel, made up of independent scientists and researchers from around the United States concluded that contamination at the facility resulted in 300-1,800 cancer deaths. The report also concluded that the SRE meltdown caused the release of more than 458 times the radiation released at Three Mile Island. Their findings can be found at ssflpanel.org

Conflict over the facility is ongoing.

 Conflict over cleanup .
At least 4 nuclear accidents and over 30,000 rocket and engine tests have occurred at SSFL over the years. Many critics and local residents believe that SSFL remains a highly polluted site to this day. Widespread use of highly toxic chemicals to power the rocket tests and to clean rocket test-stands after the testing as well as contamination that resulted from the considerable nuclear research is at the heart of such claims.

Cleanup Standards.
Future use of the land SSFL is located on is also a source of much debate. The site's current owners, the Boeing Company have issued statements suggesting that the land may be sold for future unrestricted residential development without having cleaned the site up to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cleanup standards. On August 2, 2005, Pratt & Whitney purchased Rocketdyne from Boeing, but refused to acquire SSFL as part of the sale.

In 1989, DOE found widespread chemical and radioactive contamination at the site, and a cleanup program commenced. In 1995 EPA and DOE announced that they had entered into a Joint Policy Agreement to assure that all DOE sites would be cleaned up to standards consistent with EPA s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) standards, also known as Superfund.

However, in March 2003, DOE reversed its position and announced that SSFL would not be cleaned up to EPA Superfund standards. While DOE simultaneously claimed compliance with the 1995 Joint Policy Agreement, the new plan included a cleanup of only 1% of the contaminated soil, and the release of SSFL for unrestricted residential use in as little as ten years. EPA responded to this announcement by claiming that DOE was not subject to EPA regulation due to the fact that DOE existed as a separate entity under the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, and refused take steps to force DOE adherence to the 1995 agreement.

In August 2003, the Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report on Energy and Water Appropriations, urging DOE to live up to its commitments in the 1995 Joint Policy and clean up SSFL to EPA s CERCLA standards. Shortly thereafter, DOE responded to the Senate, claiming it was in fact consistent with both the Joint Policy and EPA s CERCLA standards.

In December 2003, soon after DOE's announcement that it was consistent with the 1995 agreement, EPA issued its own formal findings. EPA determined that the cleanup was not consistent with its CERCLA standards, and that sufficient contamination would remain at levels that would be dangerously inappropriate for unrestricted residential, and that the only safe use under DOE's revised cleanup standards would be restricted day hikes with limitations on picnicking.

Critics point out that if the DOE-Boeing cleanup plan was followed through and the site was released for unrestricted residential use, the property would likely become a Superfund site subject to EPA standards. After the sale, the site would no longer be a DOE facility, and thus, the exemption from CERCLA standards would no longer be in effect. The end result being that the site would only be brought into compliance with CERCLA cleanup standards after Boeing has sold the property, relieving the company of any burden of cleanup costs. The costs would likely be passed on to taxpayers, and not those responsible for the actual contamination. This is merely critical analysis, however, and it remains unclear as to what cleanup standards DOE and Boeing will end up setting for themselves.

 Community involvement .
Every quarter, Simi Valley hosts workgroup meetings regarding the cleanup of SSFL that is open to the public attendence and comment.

The workgroup consists of representatives from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the U.S. EPA. Public policy organizations such as Committee to Bridge the Gap also send representatives as part of the work group. Other organizations and private companies also attend as part of the workgroup depending on the topic pending. The meeting is moderated by the EPA.

DOE and Boeing are also invited to the workgroup meetings but have not attended for the past several years.

The workgroup meetings are held at the following location:

Cultural Arts Center
3050 Los Angeles Avenue
Simi Valley, CA 93065

<doc id="8833112" title="Albert Morris" nonfiltered="482" processed="478" dbindex="450485">
Albert Morris was born on 13th August 1886 in Bridgetown, South Australia. Faced with the depression in the South Australia of the late 1880s, Morris's father sought work in the new mines of the Barrier ranges and moved his family to Broken Hill to live.

Morris spent much of his life in Broken Hill. Early in life, Albert developed a keen interest in plant life. It is possible that a serious injury to his foot in his early childhood which prevented Morris from taking part in the bustle of childhood activity, contributed to his independence and self-containment, and to an increasing interest in botany. By the time he was undertaking technical school studies in metallurgy and assaying, Morris had developed a small garden and nursery, and contributed to the cost of his fees by selling plants (pepper trees) that he had grown. When he qualified Morris took up work on the Central Mine at Broken Hill, eventually becoming chief assayer for the mine.

Morris was married at Broken Hill on 13 April 1909 to Ellen Margaret Sayce, a dressmaker. She was a forceful personality and a staunch member of the Society of Friends; in 1918 Morris also became a Quaker after an Anglican upbringing. They built a tiny cottage in Cornish Street, Railway Town (a suburb of Broken Hill). This was an area most exposed to soil erosion and drifting sand: trees had been cut for fuel and years of overstocking and the rabbit plague had denuded the land. Broken Hill was plagued by drifting sand and dust which in summer became major dust storms making work and domestic life difficult. 

Over some sixty years of settlement the landscape around the Barrier Ranges had progressively been denuded by pastoral activity, by exotic animals such as rabbits and feral goats, by mining and its residues, and by the presence of a vast settlement of people and their animals. 

As early as 1908, newspaper comments indicated that the sheet erosion around Broken Hill had already begun. Morris described the degraded landscape in these terms: 
"The extending country stretched for miles without a vestige of any green thing and each stone or old tin had a streamer of sand tailing out from it. The fences were piled high with sand, inside and out and it looked as if the intended railway lines would just be buried every dusty day, which was every windy day." 

Several failures at establishing a barrier to the wind and sand in his garden inspired Morris to experiment with plants that might be grown in arid regions. In this work, he was assisted by Edwin Ashby, a fellow Quaker and Adelaide naturalist, who had developed a system of watering to optimise survival of plantings in arid regions. He continued his work of propagation, purchasing adjoining land so he could expand his nursery and garden. Morris also started to make field trips into the country around Broken Hill, studying and collecting specimens of the local flora.
 
He made a collection of about 8000 specimens from Broken Hill and western New South Wales, which was donated to the Waite Institute in South Australia. He was noted for his generosity and hospitality to fellow naturalists and others working at Broken Hill. Among those he helped was the noted botanist and writer Thistle Harris.

In 1920 with W.D.K. McGillivray he helped establish the Field Naturalists' Club and remained its secretary until his death in 1939. One of the members of the field naturalists was Maurice Mawby (a junior member) who was a great supporter of Morris s work and who later managed the Zinc Corporation Mine at Broken Hill. Morris became widely recognised for his work and contributions of plants to residents and civic bodies in Broken Hill, and for his firm belief in the possibility of re-establishing vegetation around the city.
 
While he trained and worked as an assayer at the Central Mine, it was as a botanist and conservationist that he is best remembered. His enduring legacy at Broken Hill was the 'green belt' of revegetation and regeneration around the city that he conceived and worked to establish. 

In 1936 changes in the management of the Zinc Corporation resulted in the appointment of A.J. Keast as manager of the mine. Keast along with W.S. Robinson the Managing Director of the Zinc Corporation was keen to improve working and living conditions for miners at Broken Hill. They saw the need to control the dust and sand which continually moved about the mining area. Mawby introduced Morris to Keast. Morris who advised him that he could certainly provide the answer to the problem of the dust that the company wished to solve, for it was something he had advocated for many years -planting indigenous species that would check the wind and control the soil; using strategically placed barriers to shield plants from the winds; and fencing to exclude stock and rabbits. 

Based on his experience and consulting with Keast, in 1936 he conceived an initial plantation which the company established at Freemans shaft. Though still working as an assayer for the Central Mine (a rival mining company), Morris provided the honorary advice of his expertise, and helped with organising the collection of seedlings for this planting. This first green area eventually became known as Albert Morris Park. 

Other plantings followed, the most significant of which was an ambitious plan that Morris had long advocated to enclose and revegetate the common land on the city's boundary. Such a project would ultimately provide a green belt of vegetation around Broken Hill. In this work, Keast persuaded the other main mining companies on the field to participate. While work on fencing this area began in 1936 it was not completed until 1938 and thus Morris did not see the fruits of this plan. He died early in January 1939 shortly after being diagnosed with a cerebral tumour.

<doc id="1458984" title="Hydramatic" nonfiltered="483" processed="479" dbindex="450486">
Hydramatic (also known as Hydra-Matic) was an automatic transmission developed by General Motors's Oldsmobile division. Introduced for the 1940 model year, the Hydramatic was the first fully automatic mass-produced transmission developed for passenger automobile use. 

History.
During the 1930s various automakers sought methods of reducing or eliminating the necessity of shifting gears. At the time, synchromesh gears were still a novelty (and confined to the higher gears in nearly all cases), and shifting a manual gearbox required more care and skill than most drivers cared to exert.

GM had previously experimented with the Automatic Safety Transmission, a project initiated at Cadillac division in 1934 and later developed by Buick and Oldsmobile. Oldsmobile offered the AST from 1937 to 1939; Buick, which felt the results uninspiring, offered it only in 1938. The AST was a semi-automatic transmission using planetary gears and a conventional friction clutch. 

Unsatisfied with the Automatic Safety Transmission, Oldsmobile launched a new program, headed by engineer Earl Thompson, to combine hydraulic operation of a planetary gearbox (which would allow much shifting to be automated) with a fluid coupling instead of a friction clutch, eliminating the need for de-clutching. The transmission would have four forward speeds plus reverse, providing a broad range of torque multiplication. It incorporated a parking pawl when the selector was placed in reverse with the engine off, although there was no separate Park position.

The result, dubbed "Hydra-Matic Drive," went into production in May 1939 for the 1940 model year. The first Oldsmobiles so equipped were shipped in October 1939. Advertising proclaimed it "the greatest advance since the self-starter."

In 1940 the Hydra-Matic added 57 dollars to the car's price, rising to 100 dollars for 1941. In 1941 it also became an option on Cadillacs for 125 dollars. Almost 200,000 had been sold by the time passenger car production was halted for wartime production in February 1942.

During the war the Hydramatic (mated to a Cadillac V8 engine) was used in a variety of military vehicles, including the M5 Stuart tank and the M24 Chaffee light tank. The extensive wartime service greatly improved the postwar engineering of the transmission, which was subsequently advertised as "battle-tested."

Starting in 1948 Hydramatic became optional for Pontiacs, although Buick and Chevrolet chose to develop their own automatic transmissions. One million Hydramatics had been sold by 1949. In the early 1950s various manufacturers that did not have the resources to develop an automatic bought Hydra-Matics from GM. Users included:
1950-1956 Hudson;
1950-1956 Nash;
1951 Frazer Nash;
1951-1954 Kaiser;
1954-1955 Willys ;
1950-1954 Lincoln;

In 1952 Rolls-Royce acquired a license to produce the Hydra-Matic under license for Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles. It continued production through 1967.

The Hydramatic underwent several revisions through 1955, before being replaced by the substantially redesigned Controlled Coupling Hydramatic (also called Jetaway) in 1956. The new transmission incorporated a secondary fluid coupling and a pair of sprag clutches in place of the former friction clutch and brake bands, shifting in part by alternately draining and filling the secondary coupling. It allowed the driver to hold the transmission in low or in third gear until the maximum allowable upshift points, for improved performance in traffic or in mountain driving, and incorporated a separate Park position.

The new transmission was substantially smoother than the original, but also more complex and expensive to produce, so in the early 1960s it was phased out in favor of the lighter Roto Hydramatic torque converter automatic and, ultimately, the Turbo-Hydramatic.

The original Hydramatic continued to be used in light trucks and other commercial vehicles well into the 1960's. It was subsequently replaced in that role by the Turbo Hydramatic, whose simplified design was much less costly to manufacture. Despite the name, the Turbo Hydramatic (THM) was not mechanically related in any way to the original Hydramatic.

The Hydramatic was a complex design that was expensive to mass produce. Nevertheless, despite some early teething problems, it was fairly reliable and was so rugged that it was widely used in drag racing in the 1960's. It was not as smooth as some competitors (notably Buick's Dynaflow, the ultimate in slip 'n slide), but it also sacrificed less performance. It paved the way for the widespread acceptance of automatic shifting.

Hydramatic is now a trade name for GM's automatic transmission division, which produces a variety of later transmissions, the most notable of which is the Turbo-Hydramatic from the 1960s to the 1990s.

Design.
The Hydramatic used a two-element fluid coupling (not a torque converter, which has at least three elements, the pump, turbine and stator) and three planetary gearsets, providing four forward speeds plus reverse. Standard ratios for the original Hydra-Matic were 3.82:1, 2.63:1, 1.45:1 and 1.00:1 in automotive applications, and 4.08:1, 2.63:1, 1.55:1 and 1.00:1 in light truck and other commercial applications.  The Jetaway Hydramatic used 3.96:1, 2.55:1, 1.55:1, and 1.00:1.

A unique feature of the Hydramatic design was the manner in which the fluid coupling was interposed in the power flow. In modern automatics, all engine power passes through the torque converter and then on to the gear train. Unless the converter includes a clutch to lock the turbine to the pump, some slippage will always occur, which can have a significant negative effect on efficiency and fuel economy. This was not the case with the Hydramatic.

In first gear, power flow was through the forward planetary gear assembly (either 1.45:1 or 1.55:1 reduction, depending on the model), then the fluid coupling, followed by the rear gear assembly (2.63:1 reduction) and through the reverse gear assembly (normally locked) to the output shaft. That is, the input torus of the fluid coupling ran at a lower speed than the engine, due to the reduction of the forward gear assembly. This produced an exceptionally smooth startup because of the relatively large amount of slippage initially produced in the fluid coupling. This slippage quickly diminished as engine RPM increased.

When the transmission upshifted to second gear, the forward gear assembly locked and the input torus now ran at engine speed. This had the desirable effect of "tightening" the coupling and reducing slippage, but unfortunately also produced a somewhat abrupt shift. It wasn't at all uncommon for the vehicle to lurch forward during the 1-2 shift, especially when the throttle was wide open.

Upon shifting to third, the forward gear assembly went back into reduction and the rear gear assembly locked. Due to the manner in which the rear gear assembly was arranged, the coupling went from handling 100 percent of the engine torque to about 40 percent, with the balance being handled solely by the gear train. This greatly reduced slippage, which fact was audible by the substantial reduction that occurred in engine RPM when the shift occurred.

The shift from third to fourth gear locked the forward gear assembly, producing 1.00:1 transmission. The fluid coupling now only handled about 25 percent of the engine torque, reducing slippage to a negligible amount. The result was a remarkably efficient level of power transfer at highway speeds, something that torque converter equipped automatics could not achieve without the benefit of a converter clutch.

Many Hydramatics did not execute the 2-3 shift very well, as the shift involved the simultaneous operation of two bands and two clutches. Accurate coordination of these components was difficult to achieve, even in new transmissions. As the transmission's seals and other elastomers aged, the hydraulic control characteristics changed and the 2-3 shift would either cause a momentary flare (runup in engine speed) or tie-up (a short period where the transmission is actually in two gears at the same time), the latter often contributing to failure of the front band.

Use in Pop Culture.
In the 1978 musical Grease, Danny Zuko (played by John Travolta) describes his beloved hot rod as automatic, systematic and hydra-matic. Why it's Greased Lightning!

Trivia.
The Hydramatic (not the Jetaway version) did not have a separate park position as found in modern automatic transmissions.  The driver had to shut off the engine and then place the transmission in reverse in order to lock the driveline to prevent the car from moving.

The first version of the Hydramatic used a mechanical pawl to lock the planet carrier of the reverse gearset when the driver wished to back the vehicle.  This arrangement did not work well in practice and was replaced with a cone clutch.

The all cast iron Hydramatic was the heaviest automatic transmission ever produced for automobiles.

Glosa is an international auxiliary language (auxlang), that was developed by Lancelot Hogben (as Interglossa, GB, 1943), Ronald Clark and Wendy Ashby (GB, 1972-1992).  Glosa is of the type that linguists call isolating, meaning that there are no inflections. 

Words remain always in their original form, no matter what function they actually have in the sentence. The same word can function as a verb, noun, adjective or preposition within reason.  Grammatical functions are taken over by some operator words and the word order (syntax).  Glosa is written with the Latin alphabet without special characters, there are no double vowels or consonants.

The Glosa words are taken from Latin and Greek, and are related to many languages including east-Asiatic languages like Chinese, Creole languages from Africa, pidgin languages and to an extent English.

Linn Githmark (born September 22, 1982 in Oslo, Norway) is a Norwegian curler who has skipped her country to a world junior title, and also played in the Norway team that won a silver medal at the main world championships.

A stalwart of the team representing Norway in world junior championships since 1997, Linn was skip on all but two occasions.  She had to endure indifferent placings in the competition until 2004, when she suddenly struck a rich vein of form that drove her team to the gold medal.  

The timing of Linn's blossoming talent could not have been better for the main Norway women's team, which had lost the services of Hanne Woods, and desperately needed a replacement of similar calibre.  Linn made her world championship debut in 2004, slotting straight into Hanne Woods' third place in the playing order.  She proved an excellent foil for veteran skip Dordi Nordby in a campaign that saw Norway pick up the silver medal.  Bronzes followed at the European Championships later in the year, and at the 2005 worlds.

Linn has also turned heads for considerably more than her ability on the ice, leading some to wonder if she might eventually do a little for women's curling of what Anna Kournikova and Maria Sharapova have done in the tennis world.

Githmark posed nude for Ana Arce's "Fire on Ice" 2007 Team Sponsorship Calendar to promote women's curling.

Hückeswagen a town is in the north Oberbergischen Kreis in governmental district Cologne in North Rhine-Westphalia Germany, approximately 40 km away from Cologne. Neighbouring towns include Radevormwald, Wipperfürth, Wermelskirchen and Remscheid.

Geography.
Hückeswagen lies on the river Wupper. Two dams, Bevertal dam and Wuppertal dam, are near the city . Hückeswagen's location in the narrow valley and well as the castle mountain are notable.

The coat of arms of Hückeswagen.
The arms were granted on August 9, 1892.
The arms show in the upper part the lion from the arms of the Counts of Berg, who bought the area in 1260 from the Counts of Hückeswagen. The lower part is a symbol for the textile industry, which has been important to the town since the late Middle Ages. The combination of lion and spindle appears first in a seal from 1555.

History.
Hückeswagen was an ancestral seat of the counts of Hückeswagen and in 1085 became for the first time a Franconian Salhof, or saddle court, in form of a "confirmation of a donation of the genotypes of the Essen abbess Svanhild among other things by emperors Heinrich IV. (HRR)" mentions documentary. (Documentary first namings oberbergische places v. Klaus Pampus). 

Between 1220 and 1240 the counts of Hückeswagen moved to Bohemia and built the "Hukvaldy" and "Altischein" castles.  

Between 1490 and 1508 the "Nikolaus church" was built. Later the "Paulus church" was established after a fire.

Town privileges were given to Hückeswagen on 4 April 1859 according to Rhenish town order.  From 1861 to 1920 Hückeswagen consisted of the municipality and Neuhückeswagen, a juridically
rural community. On 1 March 1920 the juridically independent municipalities were combined. On 18 October 1875 the still young city was connected to the railroad network. During the period of industrialisation Hückeswagen had a significant textile industry.  Cloth available in Hückeswagen today testifies to the great prosperity of the industrial families.  The importance of the town as the center of the local area has been reduced in last few decades as the neighbouring town Wipperfürth received some municipal and public facilities to establish itself as an important center. Because of municipal reform, in 1975 the town lost the share of Bergisch Born in Remscheid.

Population.
On 31 August 2004 Hückeswagen had 16,541 inhabitants; 1,209 residents are of foreign origin. The number of females (8,561) exceeds the male inhabitants (7,983).

Origin of the name.


The name derives from the earlier form "Hukensuuage" or "Huckengeswage", signifying the settlement of a man named Hugobert or Hugibald. Local history researcher  Wilhlem Blankertz presents a different theory in his publications, that the oldest local name was "Hukengesuuage", meaning "settlement of the Hunginger family near the water". The settlement was mentioned for the first time in 1085 in a deed document issued by the abbess Swanhildis of Essen to a nobleman. Around 1298 the form "Huckenshove" came into use.

In many campaign settings for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, the Avariel are a race of winged elves. They are also known as the "winged folk" and the "al karak elam."

Society.
The avariel make their homes in open areas, and take immense joy in flying. They absolutely abhor and detest being inside, underground, or otherwise restricted from the open sky. The avariel are known for their fierce clerical tradition, as devout worshippers of the Seldarine sky goddess Aerdrie Faenya. 

Avariel in the Forgotten Realms.
The avariel are very rare in Faerûn, since they have been hunted nearly to extinction by various dragons. Avariel remain in any number in only one place the Aerie of the Snow Eagles, a secluded mountain home in the north. Avariel maintain good relationships with aarakocra, and those in the Aerie of the Snow Eagles have recently reestablished contact with their cousins in Evermeet.

Avariel in other media.
Computer and video games.

In the PC game Baldur's Gate II, one of the NPCs that may join the protagonist on his quest is an avariel female called Aerie, who had been captured, had her wings sawed off, and been raised in a circus by a gnome.

More recently, in an expansion to the PC game Neverwinter Nights, one of the optional quests requires the player to free some avariel from an enchantment which keeps them trapped underground.

Costuming.
The winning design for the 2005 GenGon costume contest is an exquisite avariel designed by "Lady Rachel."  The design and construction required over five years and 3,000 feathers on a mechanical frame.  The creator of this costume is now developing a web site to assist other in the creation of these elaborate winged costumes. www.The-Avariel.com

<doc id="452274" title="Infinity Watch" nonfiltered="494" processed="490" dbindex="450497">


The Infinity Watch is a group of fictional characters in Marvel Comics' universe. The Watch was gathered in Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1, and starred in that series until it ended with issue #42. The six members were the self-appointed guardians of everything. 

History.
When Adam Warlock obtained possession of the all-powerful Infinity Gauntlet (that contained the six Infinity Gems) from Thanos, he was ordered by the Living Tribunal to separate the Gems so that they might never be used in conjunction again. Warlock formed the Infinity Watch, entrusting each member with an Infinity Gem to protect (keeping the identity of the sixth member a secret even from his fellow Infinity Watch-members). It must be noted that, under the Gauntlet's influence, Warlock was not in his right mind, and even he wondered if he had made the right choices later on. 

Initially, Warlock did not intend for the Watch to become a team; he believed the gems would be safer if they were all kept separately, but Warlock's old enemy, the Man-Beast abducted four Infinity Watch members and manipulated their gems in an attempt to destroy Warlock. After the Man-Beast was defeated, the Infinity Watch chose to stay together as a heroic team, except for Thanos. However, Thanos, having undergone a period of humility after the Infinity Gauntlet affair, did not abuse his gem, but kept it safe. 

Warlock negotiated a deal with the Mole Man to use a castle on Monster Island as the Watch's base. With help from The Avengers and Warlock, the United Nations recognised the Mole Man's sovereignty of Monster Island. Infinity Watch dealt with many foes, most of them interested in the power the Gems could confer on their owner, others had personal interests in the Infinity Watch members. 

An amnesiac man appeared on Monster Island and was taken in by the Watch despite Gamora's warnings. Gamora, holding the Time Gem, had had visions of this man killing Adam Warlock. The Watch named the man Maxam after a symbol found on his belt and he joined the Watch, despite a violent outburst against Warlock. 

A while later Gamora would leave the team after an argument with Adam Warlock. Maxam became the new Guardian of the Time Gem. Donning the Time Gem his memories returned and he battled Adam Warlock, who would turn into the Magus and nearly exterminate mankind on Maxam's world. Under Moondragon's telepathic influence, Maxam believed that he had broken Warlock's neck and returned to his own world.

Meanwhile the being known as Rune stole all the Infinity Gems and took them to the Ultraverse. With Gamora, Maxam and the gems gone, the Watch disbanded. Although the gems were eventually returned to the Marvel Universe, the Watch has not been fully reestablished yet; however, Adam Warlock, Gamora, and Pip were shown attempting to overthrow the Champion of the Universe's rule of the planet Skardon in the 2004 2005 She-Hulk series, and at one point recruited Drax to aid in their efforts.

Members.
Adam Warlock (Soul Gem);
Drax the Destroyer (Power Gem);
Gamora (Time Gem);
Moondragon (Mind Gem);
Pip the Troll (Space Gem);
Thanos (Reality Gem) (ally);
Maxam;

Notes.
Many members of the Infinity Watch were chosen for their inability to use their assigned Gem's full potential: ;
Pip was a coward and would keep his Space Gem safe because he would teleport to safety at the first sign of trouble.
Drax had brain damage and was only able to tap into the Power Gem to increase his own already formidable strength and ability to project energy.
Gamora was unable to use her Time Gem consciously, but her skills as one of the universe's greatest assassins would keep the gem safe.
Moondragon had no trouble using the Mind Gem but could not read the minds of her fellow Watchmen. This was a fail safe Warlock put on her gem when he had the Infinity Gauntlet. However Warlock could telepathically communicate to anyone holding an Infinity Gem. ;
Most wielders of an Infinity Gem attached the gem to their forehead, but Pip kept his gem hidden between his toes and Drax swallowed his gem, thinking it was a piece of candy. His unique digestive tract kept the gem safely within Drax's stomach.

Killing No Murder is a pamphlet published in 1657 during The Protectorate period of the English Interregnum era of English history.  The pamphlet of disputed authorship advocates the assassination of Oliver Cromwell.  The publication was in high demand at the time of its distribution.  Cromwell was said to have been so disturbed after the publication of Killing No Murder that he never spent more than two nights in the same place and always took extreme precaution in planning his travel.

Possible Authors.
Killing No Murder was published under the pseudonym 'William Allen' but the authorship is largely attributed to one of three individuals or some combination of the three. The individuals generally attributed with authorship are (in order):  Colonel Silius Titus, Edward Sexby or William Allen.  

Silius Titus.
Colonel Titus was a politician and one of two individuals who claimed authorship of the work. Titus' claim could stand on its own merit due to the highly sarcastic nature of the document -- a trait often attributed to Titus.  In response to claims that he often "made sport of the House" and didn't take matters seriously, Titus remarked that things were not to be taken seriously simply because they were dull .  Titus' tone can be seen throughout the document and on that alone, many attribute the work to him before he admitted to writing it.  Additionally, Charles II of England awarded Titus the title of Gentleman of the Bedchamber for his service in authoring the work. 

Edward Sexby.
Sexby had returned to England to try where Miles Sindercomb had failed in exacting the call for assassination found in Killing No Murder. After failing, he was caught trying to escape to Amsterdam and was imprisoned in the London Tower.  It was there that Sexby went insane and died a year later in 1658. Before his death, he was coerced by Sir John Barkstead to admit his participation in the writing of the pamphlet.  

William Allen.
While it was often assumed that the document was written under a pseudonym, another theory suggested that William Allen, a Republican who had ties with Edward Sexby and Thomas Sheppard, had penned the document. The trio (Allen, Sexby and Sheppard) had agitated Cromwell in the past by expressing their concerns about the Army's attitude toward Parliament.  It is possible that Allen, therefore, wrote the document brazenly himself before he died but is more likely named as the author as retribution from one of the other two authors.

One More Time is a memoir by comedienne Carol Burnett. It was published by Random House in 1986 and became a New York Times non-fiction bestseller.

Burnett spent her childhood in a Depression-scarred Hollywood neighborhood, where she lived in a dingy single-room apartment with her grandmother, a hypochondriac devoted to Christian Science. The child of alcoholic parents - a mother who fantasized about success in Tinseltown and a father who eventually was committed to a public sanatorium - she constantly daydreamed about a show business career while at the same time realizing the odds of achieving one were very much against her, until a mysterious benefactor financed her move to New York City. In this book, she presents a coming-of-age tale that's humorous, heartbreaking, and hopeful.

The book served as a basis for the play Hollywood Arms, which Burnett co-wrote with her daughter, Carrie Hamilton.

<doc id="244551" title="Coq au vin" nonfiltered="500" processed="496" dbindex="450503">
Coq au vin 'rooster with wine' is a French fricassee of chicken cooked with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and garlic.  Older roosters are traditionally used because they contain a lot of connective tissue, which creates a richer broth when cooked.

Many regions of France have variants of coq au vin using the local wine, e.g. coq au vin jaune (Jura), coq au Champagne, and so on.  The most extravagant version is coq au Chambertin, but this generally involves Chambertin more in name than in practice.

History.

Various legends trace coq au vin to ancient Gaul, Julius Caesar, and so on, but in fact the dish is not documented until the early 20th century, though it no doubt existed as a rustic country dish long before that.

Preparation.

Standard recipes call for chicken, wine (often a full bottle), often brandy, lardons or bacon, button mushrooms, and usually garlic.  Recipes with vin jaune usually specify morels instead of white mushrooms.

The juices are thickened either by making a small roux at the beginning of cooking, or by adding blood at the end.

History.
The railroad line operated as the New Hope Valley Railway was originally constructed as the Durham & South Carolina Railroad (D&SC) in 1905-1906 to tap the timber resources of the valley of New Hope Creek, and served the communities of Bonsal, North Carolina where it had a junction with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (now part of CSX), Beaver Creek, North Carolina, Seaforth, North Carolina, Farrington, North Carolina, Blands, North Carolina, Penny, North Carolina, and Durham, North Carolina.  The line was extended south between 1911 and 1913 from Bonsal, North Carolina to Duncan, North Carolina where it joined the Norfolk Southern Railroad.  The D&SC line was lased by the Norfolk Southern Railroad in 1917 to provide the larger railroad with access to the City of Durham, North Carolina.  In 1925 a spur was built at Durham, North Carolina to serve the new plant of the American Tobacco Company in that city.  The line was rebuilt on a new alignment in the 1970s by the US Army Corps of Engineers when the B. Everet Jordan Dam was constructed, impounding the valley of New Hope Creek to form Jordan Lake.  The line eventually became (briefly) part of the Southern Railway, and was sold to the East Carolina Chapter, NRHS in 1983.

The northern portion of the original railroad, from the community of New Hill, North Carolina north to Durham, North Carolina has been converted into the American Tobacco Trail.

Deimon Devil Bats.
For full article see:Deimon Devil Bats (Eyeshield 21)

Koigahama Cupids.
Logo: Cupid;
Team colours: Crimson and Pink;
The Cupids are a very weak team that is well known for all of their team members having girlfriends and bringing them to the games, which aren't very many, since they usually lose and get eliminated within the first or second matches. The quarterback has an annoying habit of teasing the opposing side by stating that his team has at least ten girls cheering for them while suggesting that his opponents come from an all-boys school. It was against this team that Eyeshield 21 made his debut by scoring a comeback touchdown victory. The quarterback's girlfriend is rather stupid, and persists in thinking that her boyfriend is a rugby player, even though he has repeatedly told her that it's American Football. Eventually he just gave up. The Cupids set the worst record in the Kanto Tournament, losing to the Seibu Wild Gunmans (10-125). As a result, they surrendered during the 3rd quarter and never finished the game. The quarterback and his girlfriend have made appearances in the crowd at several of Deimon's games, including the match with Taiyo.

Oujouu White Knights.

(           j  Howaito Naitsu)
Mascot: Knight with lance on horse.
Helmet logo: Blue shield with a white crucifix.
Team colours: White and blue - akin to the Indianapolis Colts' away kit.
Jerseys feature a lightning bolt across each shoulder.
Notes: Oujouu Private Senior High School resembles the Notre Dame Cathedral to indicate that the school has a long, proud American football tradition like the University of Notre Dame in the United States. Their team's chant is "Glory on the Kingdom!" The team coach is Gunpei Shouji, a man who played football with Doburoku when they were young. A ponytailed girl named Koharu Wakana is the team manager.
The team is based on the old football maxim "Offense Wins Games, But Defense Wins Championships". If the opponent can be prevented from scoring, then only one point is needed to win. This is the direct opposite of the Deimon Devil Bats, in which ultimate offense is the best strategy. Hiruma: "If we can score 100 points to their 99 points (the number of points Oujouu scored on their first game against Deimon), then one point is all we need to win.";
Like Zokugaku, Oujouu also has a university school, whose football team are the "Silver Knights".  Currently, their players consist of the legendary "Golden Generation", known as the pinnacle of the ultimate defense and who came the closest to defeat the unstoppable Shinryuji Nagas during their time (prior to Deimon doing so this football season).

Seijuro Shin.
Seiy : Naoya Goumoto
(      Shin Seij r ) The ace linebacker of the Oujouu White Knights American football team and Sena Kobayakawa's main rival. Shin is a silent, seemingly unsociable person. Despite this, his friends include his teammates Haruto Sakuraba and Makoto Otawara. After the Oujouu's coach, Shoji Gunpei, noticed his talent when he first tried out for the Oujouu American football team with Sakuraba, he told the seniors to make sure Shin never gets recruited by any other club than the American football club. 

Shin is the fastest and strongest linebacker in all of Japan. His signature move is the Spear Tackle, a powerful one-arm thrust that can stop any opponent (much more honourable than a spear in a real game, where the tackling player leads with his helmet). He is one of the few characters who figured out that Sena was Eyeshield 21 right away. After finding out Sena's secret identity, he tells him he'll be waiting for him in the finals. He does consider Eyeshield 21 as a formidable opponent, as he admitted during the interview before the Kantou Elimination Rounds. This is due to the fact that Sena is able to achieve the legendary Speed Of Light pace (40 yards in 4.2 seconds), and was the one person who actually beat him and his Spear Tackle outright with pure speed (no cuts-moves, etc.). It was through this experience that Shin was driven to improve on his running as well as his strength. He's very good at analyzing a person's moves and how to react accordingly to stop him. Shin somewhat resembles Kenshiro from Fist of the North Star, which is used humorously in the manga to show Sena's fear of Shin (as a delusion - it's suggested that "Delusion Shin" can probably use "Hokuto-shinken" as well).

Shin's mind is constantly on his physical conditioning. While the Devil Bats are celebrating their first victories in the Fall Tournament, they meet up with the White Knights part-way, and the two teams go to eat together at a buffet restaurant. Even then, Shin uses the hoarding on the restaurant, which is a model of a bull's head (horns and all) to exercise on, by doing push-ups and one-handed chin-ups on. Shin was based on legendary martial artist and actor Bruce Lee - his facial features seem to confirm this.

He is always serious when it comes to his training, but is at an absolute loss when it comes to technology. He will break any kind of device within one minute of being handed it, since he has no idea of how the device works. So far, he's broken a camcorder, a GPS device and later on, a laptop. In a Jump advertisement for the Eyeshield 21 Nintendo DS game, Shin accidentally breaks the DS he was playing with. He is also so absorbed in American football and training to the point that when he was asked what kind of girls he likes, he replied with the requirements to become the team manager.

During the summer before the Fall Kantou Tournament, he trains at Mt. Fuji to perfect the 'Ballista' technique. He has yet to show it in the manga or anime. At end of the Fall Tournament he is voted as the MVP (Most Valuable Player), and prepares to face off against Eyeshield 21 in the Kantou Tournament.

In the anime, Shin does go up against Sena and his new Devil Bat Ghost maneuver early on. Initially he was shocked that his traditional one-arm Spear Tackle was useless against the Ghost. Sena succeeded in passing him twice. This was a rare moment in which he doubted his own ability. This led him to develop the Twin Spear Technique, using both arms to stop Eyeshield 21. Later on, he witnesses Sena develop the Devil Bat Tornado, causing him to realize that his rival was fast-evolving. He vowed to train even harder for when he and Eyeshield 21 would meet in the final showdown. Unfortunately, unless there is a major twist in the story, this is fated not to happen; Oujouu and Deimon were drawn in the same half of the Kantou tournament and, providing they win their quarter-final matchups, would meet in the semi-finals.

Prior to the start of their game against the Sado Strong Golems in the quarterfinals, Shin approaches Rikku of the Seibu Wild Gunmen, telling him of a combination of the Spear Tackle with his "Rodeo Drive", creating a new technique called the "Trident Tackle".  Used to crush Sado easily, the technique is actually preparation for the semi-final opponent: Sena and the Devil Bats! 

At present, Shin is preparing for the semifinal game with Deimon.  With the possibility of a perfected Ballista and his own Trident Tackle, combined with his belief that all of Deimon's tricks have been revealed against Shinryuji, he has total confidence in both Oujou defeating the Devil Bats and his final domination of Sena. 
In chapter 210, his theory seemed set to be put to the test as both players collide during Deimon's opening drive. However, this turned out not to be the case, as his fellow teammate Ikari tackled Eyeshield first. However, as Deimon's first drive continues, Shin immediately realized that the Devil Bats had a distinct advantage over Oujou in terms of stamina. With the Devil Bats members playing both offense and defense, and using Seibu's Shotgun Strategy, they went with 100% effort regardless of risk while the Knights only used 99%. He then persuades Sakuruba to join him on defense as he knows that only he could match Raimon in terms of catching.

Though the Knights were able to stop the Devil Bats from scoring the first touchdown of the game, Deimon still took the lead with a field goal. Shin recognized the power and ability of Musashi's kicking leg, but was unable to deflect the ball, due to being blocked by Sena. With the score 0-3 in Deimon's favor, Shin now comes to play on offense. Using the Ballista tactic, the White Knights take the lead 6-3, with a touchdown by Sakaruba, but a failed extra kick attempt. Realizing that Deimon could still score with field goals, Shin and his team must prevent the Devil Bats from scoring any touchdowns.

When the Devil Bats reclaim the ball, Shin surprises everyone by revealing his greatest secret: he has finally reached the "Speed of Light Pace" that only Sena himself had reached!  Using the power of his new-found speed and the Trident Tackle, he both catches up and stops Sena's rushing attempt, saying he has finally proven once and for all that he is the better player.  At this time, Sena has not found a means to either avoid or surpass Shin, proving that the Oujou player has ultimately become the perfect player of the tournament.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Spear Tackle - Shin uses a one-arm thrust aimed at his opponent's midsection, which is usually enough to stop him in his tracks. It can stop Sena's normal running tactics, Panther's Zero Gravity Run and Riku's Rodeo Drive, but it proves useless in the anime against the Devil Bat Ghost.
Twin Spear Tackle - By using both arms in the thrust, Shin is able to counter the Devil Bat Ghost. Shin also uses this on other players to stop them and make them fumble, as seen in the rematch against the Sankaku Punks. Whether it can overcome the Devil Bat Tornado is yet unknown.
Trident Tackle - First seen in the 203rd Down. In order to counter Sena's light-speed running, Shin asked Riku (Sena's childhood friend, now playing for the Seibu Wild Gunmans) on how to do his Rodeo Drive. By combining this method along with his Spear Tackle, Shin is able to suddenly shoot forward at 120% of his maximum speed during the instant he charges his opponent. This also delivers a more powerful thrust. It has proven effective against Sena's Devil Light Hurricane move by chapter 218.
Ballista - In chapter 206, it was revealed that the Ballista is a formation that involves putting Shin into offense. This was information that Takami, the Knights' quarterback, offered up freely when Hiruma gatecrashed the Oujouu Festival Quiz. When it comes to the first Oujouu drive of their game against Deimon, Takami is so confident of the formation's success that he actually tells the Bats which way the play will go - and he doesn't bluff them either. The nature of the Ballista is to use a Spear (Shin's trademark move) to open up a hole for the ball carrier to get through - and Shin's power is such that he actually lifts up Kurita! Whether Shin is using his Spear or Trident tackles is unclear yet, but it is likely to be just the Spear for the moment - the game is still in the first quarter. When the game comes down to the clutch, that'll be when he will pull out a Trident-based Ballista.

Haruto Sakuraba.
Seiy : Mamoru Miyano
(      Sakuraba Haruto) A typical, good-looking pop idol (he has a CD single due to recording technology, despite the fact that he can't sing), he works in an advertising company called Jari Productions. When he was young, he used to watch sports all the time and dreamed of becoming a professional athlete. In high school, he managed to enter the team as a Wide Receiver after drawing much attention from the seniors due to his height; however, the coach, Shoji, was more interested in Shin. Shin soon surpassed Sakuraba, becoming the ace of the team. Sakuraba felt a little envious of Shin's success and achievements, and was disappointed with himself for not being able to soar to greater heights. He eventually became less interested in training and sports in general. One day, Miracle Ito of Jari Productions noticed him and decided that he would be a good model. Feeling wanted and pleased to be in the spotlight for once, Sakaruba agreed to work for him. Now, he is constantly misunderstood; because of his popularity, people mistake him for the genius of the Oujou team, and disregard the true ace, Shin. In fact, his football skills are mediocre at best, especially his catching ability. Sakuraba always felt pressured to do well and to live up to assumptions people made about him. An accident in the Oujou vs. Deimon game changed it all, though: Sena, as Eyeshield 21, accidentally tackled Sakuraba while running, injuring him. The reason that Sakuraba was hit, even though he was not playing at that time, was that he ran onto the field to grab a card that Miracle Ito told him to wear as advertisement. In the hospital, after meeting Sena, Monta and his die-hard fan Torakichi, who admires Sakuraba for his catch in the game against Deimon the year before, he finally decides to stop being pessimistic and to succeed just as Shin has done. Just before the Fall tournament started, he decided to quit working with Jari Productions and focus on American football with the help of his friends after he heard Takami complimenting him and how he had waited for a friend like Sakuraba, someone like him who understood his predicaments. Before the opening ceremony, he cut his hair in a crew-cut style and started growing a goatee to show his renewed vigor in pursuing success in American football, much to the dismay of Miracle Ito, who had depended on Sakuraba's good looks to make money. This has turned out probably for the best, as if Ito had seen Sakuraba at the end of 207th Down, he would have had a coronary on the spot. Due to Ootawara's usual thickheaded nature, he and Sakuraba lost the quiz game that Oujouu ran as part of its Autumn Festival by a mile - which meant they had to do a forfeit: dress up in maid costumes. Ootawara looked ridiculous - no change there - but Sakuraba was a sight to behold.

His skills as a wide receiver have rapidly improved and Sakuraba can now be considered a real ace. He was also complimented by Shouji as the player with "the strongest heart" in Oujou, and by Unsui as one of the big four in the wide-receiver battle (along with Ikky , Monta, and Tetsuma). As of now, Sakuruba joins Shin on defense to challenge Monta of the Devil Bats. He does manage to stop Monta from receiving the ball and on Oujouu's first drive, scored for the White Knights, making it 6-3. It is interesting to note that the high-school league that is featured in Eyeshield 21 only requires one foot to land in-bounds for a caught pass to count, instead of both feet in the pros. Sakuraba was way over the touchline (though not on the ground) when he caught Takami's pass, a deliberate ploy by the Oujou passer as he knew nobody could reach that far but his intended target - and Sakuraba still managed to get a foot in bounds once he caught the pass. However, it seems that Sena may have figured out a way to stop the Everest Pass. Whether he was serious when he said Kurita should guard Sakuraba remains to be seen...

The teams once nearly made a total loss to Sankaku Punks by 6-7, but thanks to Sakuraba's improved receiving skills, they dominated the rematch and won 82-0 in the Fall tournament.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Everest Pass - Sakaurba's height plays to his advantage as a receiver, especially since Oujou's quarterback Ichiro Takami is also tall. He launches the ball at a high angle over the field, in which Sakaurba leaps up to catch it. The pass is at such a great height that the opposing team can do little about it, even if they know where it will land. It's simply too high to intercept.

Ichiro Takami.
(       Takami Ichir ) When Ichiro Takami entered the Oujou White Knights, his dream was to become a quarterback. However, a childhood leg injury left him unable to run as quickly as Otawara. After the coach told him he could not play due to this drawback, he decided to take on more training and study calculations for passing to other players. Finally, after his fourth year on the team, he officially became the team's quarterback for the Kanto Tournament. He is analytical and has some ability in reading the movements and strategies of opposing teams. His passes are done with precision and accuracy, though they are not on the same level as Hiruma's or Kid's. It has been recently revealed that he had been waiting for someone like Sakuraba to be his Wide Receiver, since both of them are tall, and are able to use that fact to compensate for their shortcomings, (ie: Takami's slow running, and Sakuraba's lack of drive and feelings of inadequacy). Together, they develop the Everest Pass.

With the rematch between Deimon and Oujou approaching, he has worked with the team to perfect the Ballista, using it in match against the former "Golden Generation".  However, Hiruma is trying to find a way around it, even sabotaging a game show at the Oujou school festival to get answers from him!  While Shin stepped in to save him at the last minute, Takami still believes the Ballista is what makes Oujou undefeatable in the tournament. What Takami doesn't know is that Hiruma had already read over the summary of the Ballista tactic, and that he and Doburoku are planning something in preparation for the game against Oujou. Now with the score 6-3 in favor of the White Knights, Takami realizes that he'd have to match Hiruma in terms of drive and mind games if he hopes to win.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Everest Pass - See Sakuraba's entry.
Ballista - See Shin's entry. Takami is, like Hiruma, a cunning player (in 215th Down he is described as using "black tactics" while pushing up glasses- a reference to One Piece's Captain Kuro). He seems to tell the Bats about which way the play will go, but all he's really saying is which way the Ballista will go - the ball doesn't necessarily go the same. This is revealed with the second Ballista play, when Takami says "The Ballista will be released to the right", conning the Bats' defense into following the call - while Takami sets ready for a pass to Sakuraba on the left. Hiruma figures it out just as the Knights' passer is letting fly with an Everest pass to Sakuraba - who is being covered by the diminutive Monta, whom Hiruma calls out to. Monta is unable to stop Sakaruba, but Hiruma almost manages to push the Oujouu receiver out of bounds.

Makoto Ootawara.
Seiy : Kenji Nomura
A VERY large lineman for the White Knights, with huge frame, muscles and ego. Ootawara is a very loud and brash person, who always says what's on his mind, in spite of the fact there's not much up there to begin with. He has a flatulence problem (he farts a lot) and he makes no effort to hide it. Ootawara doesn't even notice when his pants fall off (usually with many spectators present), even when Takami Ichirou (Oujouu's quarterback) tells him about it, he doesn't even feel embarrassed, and seems to have difficulty telling the difference between the Japanese Katakana " " (he) and the number "7". Furthermore, he has a bad habit of picking his nose in front of people. As Shouji, the White Knight's coach puts it, Ootawara is plain stupid, (and even he admits it freely).  However, Ootawara can be very insightful, which genuinely shocks just about everyone. 

However, that is also his strength, since his overall power and simplistic way of doing things makes him perfect for the line, both on offense and defense. When he's really motivated, he could rip apart two opposing rookies. In spite of how crude he can be, he's a nice guy at heart, though he is the epitome of the dumb jock. Always competing with Kurita, Ootawara usually ends up on the short end of the stick, thanks to Kurita's drive.

During the game with the Sado Strong Golems, it was revealed that he too has been training to increase his speed in order to use his strength and bulk more effectively, (though it took Shouji a week to explain the principle to him). Ootawara is now able to smash through the stoutest of opponents like a battering ram. Like Shin is with Sena, Ootawara is looking forward to his rematch against Kurita, who had defeated him in a personal contest of strength during the Spring Tournament.

Daigo Ikari.
A silver-haired freshman on the White Knights team, plays mostly on the defensive line with Ootawara.  Ikari is kept chained up because irrational behavior. He has absolutely no respect toward the graduated 'Golden Generation' members, since he never played with them.  Managed to get himself ejected from his first game against the Sankaku Punks by attacking their coach, who had just insulted Sakuraba.
From what is shown on the manga, he still hasn't played a single down, never mind a game, because of his anger problems. However, he does have great respect for Shouji, White Knights' coach. During the celebration party after the White Knights' first victories in the Kantou Tournament, he gets very competitive against Kurita and the Devil Bats, after seeing him eat 20 servings in almost no time at all. This makes him order 30 servings on the spot. The two teams get involved in an eating contest, in which they had to consume 500 servings each. The losers had to foot the bill. The White Knights lost, but luckily it was an all-you-can-eat buffet.

Ikari finally gets to play in the game between Oujou and Deimon; Shin has brought forth the idea that the Knights throw everything they've got at the Bats - including this nutter.  Prior to this game, he finally broke free of his chains, being allowed to play alongside the other White Knights in their climactic showdown.

Indeed, on the very first play of the Oujouu-Deimon game, in which Sena's running the opening kickoff back, Ikari pre-empts Shin's Trident tackle with a tackle of his own - resembling Kenshiro's fighting style, specifically the Hokuto Hyaku Retsu Ken (ironically, as some believe that Shin himself was based on the Fist of the North Star hero). However, when the play was blown dead, Ikari wasn't done - he charged headlong for Sena again to finish him off. Had it not been for Juumonji, the Bats lineman (and the Huh Huh Bros' leader) blocking him, Sena would have been history.

The power in Ikari's blocked attack ignited a memory in Juumonji. He knew Daigo Ikari previously, by a different moniker: "Prison Chain" Ikari. Back in his middle-school days, Ikari was famous as a vicious individual - he wore a thick chain over his shoulder, and was so intimidating nobody would even dare approach him. Ikari claimed at this point that he never once provoked a fight in his four years at Oujouu - which turned out to be totally false; he never did anything else. He spent more time suspended from school than anything else - but when he heard about Oujouu's Golden Generation heading to Oujouu University, and a side-comment about the White Knights turning into a poor team, he joined the side.

As previously stated, his white-hot temper has meant he's not played a single down - until the Deimon-Oujouu semifinal; and now he's in the lineup, he can finally show what he can do. And what a devastating effect he has: in the first play from scrimmage, he brushed Juumonji aside after his North Star-style attack, burst through to Hiruma and slammed him into the turf. It looked as if the Devil Bat quarterback had been sacked, but Hiruma did not have the ball when he was tackled. He had already seen Ikari attacking and threw a short pass, resulting in a 1-yard gain.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Hokuto Hyaku Retsu Ken - not given its name in ES21 yet but it is, for all intents and purposes, Kenshiro's very own Hundred Crack Fist of the North Star stuck on the end of a charging run.

Gunpei Shouji.

Shouji is the head coach and trainer of the Oujou White Knights. During his years in university, he had been an ace player for his football team, along with Deimon's trainer Doburoku. Together, they were known at the Twin Japanese Blades. Unlike his former teammate, Shouji had avoided seriously injuring himself during the Death March Training. He's a harsh but fair coach and he firmly believes that victory can only be achieved though ultimate defense. He had immediately recognized Shin's potential and had instructed the upper classmen of the team to make certain that Shin was not recruited by any other clubs. At present, he believes that the current team of White Knights is the strongest ever.

Though he and Doburoku are now on opposite sides of the field and will inevitably face each other as rivals, both still hold great respect toward one another. The two meet on the field prior to the game, in which their teams will face each other in the semi-finals, and both reminisce on their past and how far the Devil Bats and the White Knights have come to get to this point. Only time will tell which team will go to the Christmas Bowl.

Position: Coach/Trainer;

Zokugaku (Zoku to Gaku en) Chameleons.
Logo: Chameleon;
Uniform: checkered squares on the shoulders;
Team colours: Green and Blue, but different shades to Kyoshin Poseidon - closer to the former World League team Orlando Thunder.
This team has a look-alike team at Zokugaku University. They are known as the Zokugaku Frilled Lizards, which are led by Rui's older brother. ;
This entire team consists of gang members, who are not above using dirty tactics to win. The team was disqualified from the Spring tournament when some of the players beat up the referee. Like the chameleon, Zokugaku's philosophy is to adapt in order to win. They specialize in targeting an opponent's weakness in either past strategies or team members. However, they have a problem, whenever the opposing team does something that they don't expect.
Their leader accepts a challenge from Deimon where 5 million yen goes to the victor of their match. The game against the Devil Bats ends in a 28-48 loss for them. When Deimon defeats Zokugaku, the team believes that Hiruma was joking about the money, until Hiruma busts out numerous guns and grenades strapped to his body in response to Rui's unsheathing of his butterfly knife. After all, Sena once said in response to an anecdote about Rui's constant possession of a butterfly knife, "We know someone who always carries firearms." The Chameleons are forced to become his slaves to pay off their debt to him. Otherwise, Hiruma would have disassembled their motorcycles, and sell the parts for money. They help the Hah Brothers to train and learn a new technique called "rascal killing" (sometimes known as "delinquent deathblow" or "scumbag scuffle"). In the English manga, it's called "The Juvenile Deliquent Murder Method". The team was later released from their debt when the Devil Bats went to America. Hiruma wanted them to train for the Fall Tournament.
In the anime, the Devil Bats and Chameleons have a practice scrimmage just before the second matches of the Fall Tournament. The team from Zokugaku showed a better performance than before, but they still lost 28-30, due to the addition of Deimon's new Tight End. Afterwards, they were forced to carry their motorcycles home by their manager/trainer.

Habashira Rui.
(     ) The leader of the Zokugaku team. Basically, he is a punk's punk, leading his team like it was a street gang (which in fact it is). Not short on skill, Habashira's long arms make him a good linebacker, because he can intercept passes and stop runs, though he's not on the same level as Shin. Habashira's trash-talking of Shin is what motivates Sena in their game. However, he does show a more serious side, after his team is defeated by the Kyoshin Poseidon team. Hiruma noted that only Habashira tried his hardest to win. At this point, the Zokugaku linebacker begged Hiruma to tell him why, when the two of them were so much alike (both using force to rule their teams), his team lost heart while the Devil Bats fought on. 

During the start of the 2nd half of the game between the Devil Bats and the Nagas, he and Tsuyumine both witness the on-side kick, which was the start of Deimon's counterattack. Habashira leaves afterwards, saying that Deimon didn't stand a chance, but he is seen with tears in his eyes.

Firecracker Kick - Also known as a Squib Kick, the ball is kicked at an extremely low angle, causing it to bounce all over the place. This causes the opposing team members to run after it during the kick return, scattering them and making them disorganized.

Megu Tsuyumine.
The team's manager/trainer. (       Tsuyumine Megu) She is a rough, no-nonsense woman who carries a wooden practice sword and is not above torturing the team members in order for them to train harder (she and Hiruma would probably get along). Some of her known tactics are towing the players behind her motorcycle, hitting them between the legs with her wooden practice sword, and making them carry their own motorcycles home (with herself sitting on Habashira Rui's motorcycle, as he is the leader), rather than ride them. She rules the team with an iron fist and even Habashira's afraid of her. She is also an expert of surprise attacks, and interrogates the team members sereverely to "strengthen them". Tsuyumine is considered as a beauty, but because of her brutal and torturous personality, she is more feared than admired. While it was left unclear by the creators if Tsuyumine and Habashira are dating, it was said that the two are good companions who share a great deal of trust and understanding. Since Tsuyumine refers to him as "Rui", his first formal name, instead of Habashira-kun (which is Japanese custom, even for close friends, and especially for women), the possibility that they are in a serious relationship is quite strong.

Seibu Wild Gunmans.
Team Logo/Mascot: A cactus wearing a cowboy suit;
Team colours: Brown, Gold and Dark Blue - Close match to the now defunct AFL team, Iowa Barnstormers;
Helmet logo: cross-section of a six-shooter's bullet chamber. Helmets are copper-coloured.
The engrish name of Wild Gunmans has been corrected to "Wild Gunmen" in the Viz Comms translation.
Like Deimon, Seibu is highly focused on offense, with passing being the major component, (though the run with Riku has been recently added).

This is one bizarre team, but the second best team in the Spring Kantou Tournament. Their coach is an old Japanese man who acts like a real cowboy, the cheerleaders are Japanese girls who wear sexy cowgirl dress (even real guns). Their captain is the lineman Buffalo Ushijima. The most active team ever seen in Eyeshield 21 manga. During spring break, they train in Houston, Texas. Once Tetsuma, Kid and their coach team up with Sena, Mamori, Monta, and Hiruma to become Devil Gunmen in a beach football tournament, as the Seibu coach didn't want the prize, a bull, to be eaten by anyone. He also wanted it for their ranch. The teams chant is "GUN&GUN that will do"

Shien Mushanokoji, aka Kid.

"Kid" is a nickname. His real name is "Shien", which Hiruma mentions after Deimon s sports day. He is a quarterback, and has one of the fastest pass speeds in Japan, possibly in the world. Kid and Tetsuma make up one of the strongest quarterback-wide receiver combinations in Japan (by high school standards), like the legendary Joe Montana-Jerry Rice combination, although to a lesser extent. Kid specializes in quick-draw shooting, where he throws the ball as soon as he receives it from the center to Tetsuma, Seibu's wide receiver (this kind of quick release is more akin to Miami's Hall of Fame passer Dan Marino). His personality is very laid-back. However, whenever he gets the feeling that things go too well, he always predicts that something bad will happen, (which usually does, such as in the Spring tournament when they were ahead of the Oujou White Knights during the first half, Tetsuma drank too much water and could not participate in the second half). His quote is "Something bad has to happen after something so good." Recently the manga has shown that Kid is the son of an Olympic class pistol shooter, which might account for his inhuman accuracy.  He's also known Tetsuma since they were kids, accounting for how "in sync" they appear to be.  Originally Kid couldn't throw and Tetsuma couldn't catch, but they practiced all the time as kids and got better.
Position: Quarterback;
Jersey: 7;
A great sharpshooter like Hiruma, he's half-American and half-Japanese. The name 'Kid' is derived from the name of a famous cowboy, Billy the Kid.
In America, he once teamed up with Hiruma in the beach football match and used a special technique named Super Quarterback Tag. Their tosses were so fast that everyone assumed that they were using the Too Tattoos' Dancing Flea technique.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Quick-Draw Pass - Kid is a specialist with short fast passes as soon as he gets the ball. The time it takes for him to raise and pass the ball is 0.15 seconds, as opposed to a normal quarterback's speed of 0.5 seconds. Catching him in a blitz is near-impossible. His throwing technique is odd as well - as opposed to releasing the ball from over his throwing shoulder, Kid throws the ball from in front on himself using both hands to generate an incredibly fast spiral, in a similar fashion to pass training machines that wide receivers use.
Shotgun - A strategy that relies totally on passing. Instead of having one or two receivers ready to catch passes, the number is increased to four or more. The receivers spread out like buckshot pellets once the ball is snapped. This increases the number of directions in which the Kid can pass the ball. Even linebackers like Shin find it difficult to cover so many receivers at once.

J  Tetsuma.
A fast and quiet guy, he has a habit of following orders to the letter, and that can lead to disaster. It is very important to give him specific instructions and to watch him carefully. Otherwise, he will follow any general directions to the extreme. For example, the coach once said to him, "Go run a bit!!" so he kept running for 3 days and 3 nights, until he collapsed from hunger. Another time, was when Kid told him to wake him up after 3 hours while riding on a bus, Kid got off the bus earlier, but Tetsuma still waited 3 hours, then burst out of the back window of the bus to go look for Kid so he could wake him up! Whenever Kid calls a pass route, he dashes and uses it as followed, no questions asked. This makes him perfect for his position as a Wide Receiver, since the Kid doesn't even have to look for him in order to pass.  In spite of his seemingly robotic demeanor, Tetsuma is a nice person, who has been friends with Kid since they were in middle school.

One important note is that after the game with Deimon, Tetsuma invokes a penalty, by striking Monta when he was about to attack the referee for ruling in favor of Seibu. This was actually done to save Monta from destroying the Devil Bats' chances of playing for third place in the tournament. As a result, Tetsuma was banned from playing in the finals of the Fall Tournament against Oujou. Without him, the Gunmen lost out to the White Knights again, but Monta vows to meet up with Tetsuma again during the Kantou Elimination Tournament.

His name also means Iron Horse. In America they use this nickname for the steam-engine train in the old west. This gives meaning to the pass routes he is ordered to follow, which likens him to a train that cannot be altered from the track it runs. He will bowl over anyone who gets in the way on the tracks. In the game against Deimon however, Monta does manage to upset his route and cause him to fumble.
In a match against the Oujou White Knights, he was the cause of a huge lead 20-7. But because he drank too much water during half-time, he cannot continue as he has to go to the toilet the entire time, causing his team to lose 20-21.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Pass Routes - Tetsuma has drilled all known pass routes into his head and can run them like a conditioned reflex. All he needs is to hear the route called out by Kid and he'll perfectly execute the movement. Nothing can disrupt him when he runs his routes, although Monta has made him fumble once.

Riku Kaitani.
An extremely fast grey-haired boy and happens to be the one who taught Sena how to run. When Riku was in elementary school, he saw Sena being bullied and he used his speed to save him. After that Riku taught Sena that if he could run fast, he would never be bullied again. Sadly, Sena used his speed to be a gopher, (though it's ironic that being a gopher is what helped build up his speed). Riku soon left Sena's school because his family needed to move, but he and Sena met again in chapter 127. Like Shin, he was able to quickly deduce Sena's identity as Eyeshield 21. When his team went up against the White Knights, Riku proved to be no match against Shin and was unable to get by him once.

During the Kantou Tournament, Riku faced off against Ga  when he was about to beat up, possibly kill a fan who had insulted Banba, (and anyone else who was in the way). Fortunately, the incident ended without any bloodshed. After the Seibu Gunmen devastate the Misaki Wolves with a score of 82-14, they now prepare to face off against the Hakushuu Dinosaurs in the semi-finals. 

Before the match between the Strong Golems and the White Knights, Shin approached Riku and asked him for the secret of the Rodeo Drive. Initially he refused, thinking that Shin had already defeated him during the Tokyo Fall Tournament and that he didn't need such a technique. However, after learning that Shin was going to use it in a method against Sena, Riku agreed to show him, thinking that Eyeshield 21 might be the one to beat him.  

Position: Running Back/Safety;

Sena's top speed for a 40-yard-dash is 4.2 seconds, while Riku's is 4.5. However, Riku can run at his top speed for long periods of time, while Sena's normal speed during a match is 4.5 seconds, making them roughly the same in terms of speed in a real game.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Rodeo Drive - Riku's special running technique known as Rodeo Drive is very similar to Panther's Zero Gravity run. He uses this technique to make an immediate statement at the start of game against the Devil Bats by returning the opening kickoff for a touchdown. Sena paid him back by doing the same during Seibu's first kickoff. He also uses this technique to stop opposing runners. However, it is not effective against Shin's Spear Tackle nor Sena's Devil Bat Tornado.

Taiy  Sphinx.
Logo: Sphinx;
Team colours: sandy yellow, turquoise-blue (closest NFL match: Jacksonville Jaguars). Team uniform is striped. ;
This strong team is one of the best in the Kanagawa prefecture. The entire team is made up of idiots except for Banba. Their players act like Egyptians because their headmaster, after excavating a ruin, became obsessed with the Egyptians and opened a school that looks like a pyramid. Their philosophy is based on the importance of the line and they are reputed to have the heaviest. However, their backfield is substantially less than Deimon's.
Due to their philosophy of the importance of the line, Taiy  is considered more of a defensive team. They focus on stopping the advance of the opposing side and protecting the quarterback.
They were originally chosen to go against the Nasa Aliens, due to the fact that just about every member of Taiyo Sphinx was massively built, in which the sponsors assumed they could take the hits from the large American players. However, thanks to Hiruma's computer hacking skills, they get involved in a match against the Devil Bats for the chance to play against the Americans. ;
Their game against Deimon ends in a tie (20-20), but Banba surrenders the chance to play against the Nasa Aliens to his opponents after they had shown his team the true spirit and drive to win, despite the difference in power, size, and especially climate (the Taiyo field is an arid dustbowl). One thing to note is that all of the students look somewhat Egyptian (their skin is dark). This is explained in a small snippet: all the students are into surfing since Shonan beach is right next door, hence the tans. ;

The four players to take note of are:

Mamoru Banba.
Massive center of the team. The team captain and powerhouse. He holds the high school record for the squat. Although he is more skillful than Kurita, he does not have as much raw strength. Due to his harsh training for the Fall Tournament, Banba's face has more scars.  His build also is much more powerful looking as shown in chapter 200 of the manga, so it's presumed his strength has increased as well.

Unfortunately, whatever training he had undergone was insufficient to match the Dinosaurs' powerhouse lineman Rikiya Ga . Despite the new formation called Tutankhamun's Mask, Banba was pushed down easily at the start of the match. At the end of the game, he is seen being carried out on a stretcher, as he had sustained the most injuries in protecting Harao, Taiyou's quarterback.

Bench-press: Unknown as of most recent appearance (200th down), previously 140 kg;

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES

Pyramid Line - The signature formation of the Sphinx. The Pyramid Line involves the linemen going into a V-shaped "pyramid" formation, which takes advantage of the heavier-built players. This gives high protection for the quarterback and makes a formidable obstacle when on defense. However, it can be defeated by certain tactics like the Ha-Ha Brothers' Juvenile Delinquent Murder Method, random player arrangements, and the Devil Bat Dive. Another problem is that Harao has difficulty finding a receiver if the huge line moves backward and blocks his view.

Tutankhamen s Mask - The linemen arrange themselves more tightly together than normal, making the spaces between them narrower and forming closer to the quarterback. This is alluded to the Death Mask of the Pharaoh. In theory, the line was made even more secure and harder for the opposing team to break through to sack the quarterback.

Kiminari Harao.
(      Harao Kiminari) The whining quarterback. He bosses everyone around and puts the blame on them until in Volume 6, Banba sets him straight. For some reason, he's popular with the ladies and has his own harem. He acts like a pharaoh. However, compared to Hiruma, his skills as a quarterback are substantially less. His over-dependence on the Pyramid Line has made him slower and less able to avoid sacks. If he can't find a receiver, then he will just stand in place, rather than try to run the ball himself. He also tends to hold the ball too high when passing, which can lead to fumbles when he's tackled. 

Though he appears to be an arrogant snob, Harao is actually quite sensitive about his skills as a quarterback. He knows that others consider him as a second-rate player; even his own team members think so. Like Sakaruba was, Harao is seen as the ace of the team by his fans, though his skills do not match that of his image. He admits to Banba that since the game against Deimon, that he has been trying to improve himself, but he still has doubts, especially since every Kantou Tournament, the Sphinx participate but never win due to the other teams being like monsters. Like Banba, this will be his third and last Kantou Tournament. Banba assured him that the new Tutankhamen s Mask formation would protect him, so all he had to do was throw the ball. However, as the formation crumbles easily under the power of the Dinosaurs' monstrous new lineman, Harao began to experience true fear. 

At half-time, with the entire roster of linemen sustaining injuries, (including broken bones), and Banba out of commission, Harao was forced to forfeit the match. He was the only member who had not been seriously hurt, since Banba had tried his hardest to protect him. He was also the first QB that had faced Gaou of the Dinosaurs, that was still standing at the end of the game. However, the once-proud quarterback takes no solace in this.

Niinobu Kasamatsu.
The second-largest lineman on the pyramid line. He talks too much and is always getting the blame from Harao and apologizing to him. He starts picking on the Ha-Ha Brothers, but is beaten by Juumonji twice, first with the Juvenile Delinquent Murder Method, then with just a normal block. He's not very bright and is easily fooled by trick plays and trap blocks.

During the game with the Dinosaurs, he is among the casualties and his team is forced to surrender at half-time.

Ken Kamaguruma.
Kamaguruma is a large first-year who plays cornerback. He's a bit dim-witted, but a pretty good player. He gives Monta some trouble when he comes in during the second-half of the Taiyo game. He is "The Chariot" for Taiyo. His moves include "Chariot Bump" and "Chariot Attack".  However, Monta's catching ability far outstripped his skills. It is also shown that his Bump Technique has no effect against Seibu's receiver Tetsuma.

Like his teammates, Kamaguruma is stopped at the quarter-finals at the Kantou Tournament, when the Pyramid Line's new formation fails against the brutal power of the Dinosaurs' new lineman.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES

Chariot Bump - Before the receiver can catch the ball, Kamaguruma thrusts out with both hands to knock the receiver off-balance, throwing off his timing. Technically speaking, this could be considered as pass interference.
Chariot Attack - Basically it's a running version of the Bump. It is done in motion and is used to knock away opposing blockers and receivers.

Shinry ji Naga.
Logo: Dragon;
Team colours: somewhere in-between the New Orleans Saints and Cincinnati Bengals - charcoal-grey or black, with two-tone gold/orange detail.
Team uniform bears flames down the side of both the jerseys and pants, and across the top of the helmet. Team dress outside of games kind of resembles a Buddhist monk's robes.
Before the start of each game, the linemen go into a kind of meditation exercise to achieve a Zen state of mind. Supposedly, this is to get them mentally prepared for the game and nothing can disturb them when they are like this... that is, until Ikkyu commented on some cute girls.
The strongest team in the Kanagawa area by far. Known as the "Gods of Kantou", they've won the Kantou tournament for 9 years straight. Four of the players resemble the main characters from Journey to the West (or as they call it, Saiyuki). The name Shinry ji can translate to "Temple of the Dragon God".
The team is made up of members who are good all-rounders, with two aces, (Agon and Ikkyu). As a result, they are well-balanced in both offense and defense, which is directly opposite to Deimon's team of specialists.
Their coach is Sendou Dasumito, an old man who looks much like a hermit martial arts master would look like in a martial arts movie. He guides the team with seeming wisdom and tactics, though he always turns a blind eye toward Agon and his lack of discipline, due to his God-Impulse Ability.
Another fact about the team is that they had never allowed any opponent a two-point conversion against them. This record is destroyed along with their bid for a 10th Kantou Championship when they lose to the Devil Bats in the opening round in quite possibly the most unbelievable upset in their entire history.

Unsui Kong .
A very strong player. Not much is known about him, but in the previous year's match between the Oujou White Knights and Shinry ji Naga, both he and his brother (as first-year players) were sent out with 5 minutes to play and Oujou holding a 16-3 lead. Their entrance resulted in a 17-16 victory for Shinry ji. During their second-year Spring Tournament, the Nagas trounce the White Knights by a score of 40-3, without Agon playing at all. Unsui is passionately devoted to football, but is considered merely a "good" player. In contrast, Agon takes a casual, cynical, almost scornful approach to the sport, but is far better. Far more serious and intense than Agon, Unsui is much better liked, as opposed to feared like his brother is. He is a good player because of his wide range of vision, allowing him to know where all his players are.

Rather than Agon's talent being innate, Unsui has worked all his life to become as good as he is. His workrate seemed to have been recognized when he received a sports scholarship at Shinry ji, but it turns out it was meant for Agon - the school got the twins' names mixed up. He feels his purpose is to back Agon up as much as he can, to make his god-given talents shine even more brightly.

Unsui does recognize Deimon's offensive potential and has taken a more conservative approach to defeat them during the second half of the Kantou tournament game. However, with the Devil Bats counterattacking, he is becoming unsure of the outcome. His greatest shock comes when Eyeshield 21,ignores his brother completely and forces Unsui to fumble, followed by the unbelievable event in which Unsui's seemingly invincible sibling was toppled by Sena.

As the game winds down, Unsui and the rest of the team are taking no prisoners. Despite being pressured by Agon and Ikkuyu to let them have the ball (wanting to get revenge on Sena and Monta respectively for the upsets they've caused), the Nagas had decided to just run out the remaining five minutes and prevent Deimon from getting any more points. The formation they used was an advanced version of the Dragon Fly, their double-quarterback trademark play; the Golden Dragon Fly has a three-quarterback setup, featuring Ikkyu Hosakawa as the third passer and multiple flea-flicker-style lateral passes. Using desperate run-stuffing tactics, Deimon were able to hold all but Agon, who managed to gain a first down as a result of this ploy, but they ended up going three-and-out and were forced to punt.

Shinry ji assume that they have won after pinning the Devil Bats on their own 2-yard line with just one minute left on the clock - and 98 yards separating them. However, even that was not enough to stop the Devil Bats. Instructing the rest of the team to aim for the sidelines (in order to stop the clock when they go out of bounds) Hiruma goes into what is effectively a one-man no-huddle offense. Eyeshield 21 gets the ball and heads straight for the sideline, but the Naga are on to them - Agon chops into him with one of his most scything tackles so far, keeping both Sena in bounds and the clock running. Hiruma then spikes the ball to stop the clock and on the next play, uses a diversion to move the chains. Designating Yukimitsu as a lineman, he gets him to run a motion play route to the other side of the line before the snap, to misdirect Shinry ji into blocking the wrong way. This led Deimon to a first down on their own 13, and 45 seconds left. As time continues to tick away, Hiruma continues to use these sideline/spike tactics and the Bats make it as far as midfield. After an incredible pair of high-risk plays and a touchdown by Hiruma, the Nagas now must deal with the possibility of a Sudden Death Overtime or a loss if the Devil Bats decide on a two-point conversion and succeed. To everyone's surprise, it looks as if Deimon will try for overtime as Musashi is rushing toward the ball to kick it in. Sena is placed at the end of the scrimmage line, which convinces everyone that he is not going to try for the Devil Bat Dive. Now the game draws to a close as Shinry ji attempts to block the kick.

However, this is not to be as Hiruma fakes the kick and rushes toward the goal line with Musashi ahead of him. The two plow into the Nagas defensive line in what appears to be a last-ditch power play to score through brute force. When it appears that the Nagas had stopped them, the Deimon quarterback wheels about and laterals the ball backward to Eyeshield 21. It appears that Sena was placed at the end of the scrimmage line to deceive the Nagas and had used the faked kick as a distraction to get a running start and attempt the Devil Bat Dive. In a spectacular move, Kurita forces down four Nagas, including Agon and Ikkyu, allowing Eyeshield to fall past the goal line. The end result... TWO POINTS!

Final Score: Deimon Devil Bats 36, Shinry ji Nagas 35.

In the end, when Agon warns the Nagas not to slack off in their training for the next Spring Tournament, and showing his intent to defeat the Devil Bats, Unsui feels that his brother is finally beginning to see the value of working with others, rather than just depending on his own God-given talents.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES

Dragon Fly - Using both Kongo brothers as quarterbacks, the ball is passed through multiple laterals among the team members. It is a very adaptable strategy, but its drawback is that an opponent can intercept the laterals in flight, causing a fumble (such as Eyeshield did with Agon).
Golden Dragon Fly - This involves three quarterbacks, normally with the Kongo brothers and Ikkyu. This is extremely difficult to stop, but it is possible with run-stuffing tactics.

Agon Kong .
The Kongo twins are like chalk and cheese - not only in ability, but also in attitude and personality. Agon Kongo is lazy, arrogant, vicious, invariably turns up late to the matches - often in the second half - and never ever trains, yet his skill is incredible. He is also a chauvinist who does not take rejection well, since when Mamori rejected his advances on the bridge he threw her on the ground and advanced on her. Even though Unsui is a solid player, whose skill has come from constant hard work, Agon's abilities go far beyond even the best. Kumabukuro, the reporter, says that he has tremendous talent that is only seen once every 100 years. Even the Naga coach wants everybody in the team not to act the way he does, and tells them that only Agon has the leeway to act in this manner. This is because Agon's natural talent is near-superhuman, and allows him to do whatever he wants. This has made him arrogant and over-confident in his ability. He looks down on everyone else - even his own (older) brother, whom he calls "Unko-chan" as if to scorn him (effectively a tautology, as he's calling Unsui small twice - lit. "Little Unsui the Child"). Initially, he displays his agility to Sena and makes a powerful bullet pass at Torakichi (still in his wheelchair), who teases their team but luckily is saved by Sakuraba, Monta and Sena.

Unknown to any of the main characters, he has incredible strength, as he beat up the entire Zokugaku gang in an instant. Shortly after this incident, Sena and Mamori encounter Agon on their way elsewhere. Agon tries to accost Mamori to help him get to the stadium, but Sena intervenes. Agon weasels his way out of this, however, and as he leaves the pair behind, Sena feels for the first time he has encountered someone with evil intent.

While growing up with his twin brother, it was discovered early on that Agon had a talent for learning complex physical tasks within minutes, just after seeing it. This is called the God-Speed Impulse reaction. He was able to balance and ride a bicycle on his first try. His reaction time is at the human limit and is triggered by sight. As he grew up, his brother Unsui encouraged him to develop his amazing ability, while he stayed mostly in the background. Unfortunately, this also led to building Agon's ego and his tendency to regard everyone else, including his own brother as inferior. Eventually, the two began leaning toward American Football and were recruited by the Nagas.  Agon's God-Speed impulse is similiar to the Marvel Comics villain Taskmaster and his ability of photo-mimetic/reactive reflexes. 

During the draw to decide who faces who in the Kantou Tournament, Shinry ji and Deimon are fated to meet in the first round (Gods against Demons, as it were). When the time came for Shinry ji to draw for their place in the tournament, Agon took the ball upon seeing Sena - and threw another bullet pass like the one he threw at Torakichi, this time aimed directly for Sena's right eye. Sena dodged the ball with the slightest of movements, and the pass struck a coke bottle behind him held by Maruko, the Dinosaurs' quarterback. In an interview at which Hiruma is also present, Agon is shown to have a history with the Deimon passer, and his laid-back cool attitude becomes somewhat rattled whenever he is involved. Agon's arrogance in his own natural talents cause him to look down on and want to crush those he feels are less talented (absolutely everyone else, basically - he even considers the perfect team to be "22 of myself"). These are his reasons for playing football - as opposed to Hiruma's: "Because it's fun." He does, however, recognise Hiruma's ability - though he immediately counters this by saying he doesn't consider the Deimon player a threat. Agon wants everyone, without exception, to acknowledge his superiority, and is willing to destroy anyone who doesn't do so or gets in his way. He also doesn't care for normal people who work hard, thinking that only those who are truly gifted are the ones that matter. However, Hiruma is aware of this and plans on using this attitude to cause Agon's downfall.

As the game against Deimon continues, Agon starts to lose his cool, as the Devil Bats begin to fight back from a 32-0 first half thumping. He is first upset by the Devil Bats' onside kick, then is caught completely off-guard when Yukimitsu (the weakest member of the Deimon team) scored a touchdown, despite being double-covered by both him and Ikkyu. He was able to do this by analysing the Nagas' defense patterns, and picking out option routes - third pass-route choices in the middle distance, as opposed to short passes to Taki or long-distance bombs to Monta - on the fly. This, and Yukimitsu's sheer determination to succeed at something other than studying, got Deimon's first points on the board.

Afterwards, Eyeshield 21 successfully intercepted a lateral pass meant for Agon, followed by Juumonji recovering the ball (as this is classed as a fumble) and scoring the second Deimon touchdown, despite being tackled by the arrogant dreadhead. Agon ended up being dragged into the endzone by Juumonji's sheer force of will. Eyeshield's interception of Unsui's lateral got to him, but being unable to prevent Juumonji's touchdown return truly rattles him, as linemen are not known for their speed (however, the Huh Huh Brothers are built more like linebackers, as opposed to the line build possessed by Kurita and Komusubi).

In recent chapters he witnessed the one team-mate that he does give credit to, cornerback Ikkyu Hosokawa, fail to stop Deimon from scoring. His version of Eyeshield 21's Devil Bat Ghost surprises everyone, but now he is becoming even more enraged as Sena forces yet another fumble on his brother, ignoring Agon completely when the whole Shinry ji team thought he was still marking him. This is most likely the one thing that can truly upset him... not even being bothered with by the ones he most wants to crush.

In the following chapter (191st Down), the red mist descends on Agon. After a lifetime of being praised for his innate skills, to be disregarded so completely is something that he is not prepared to stand for, and in a fit of fury he tries to take Sena down... permanently. Amazingly, he fails - as he goes to chop the ball out of his grasp, Sena motions as if he was going to stiff-arm Agon away. Agon's surprise is such that he is caught off-guard for a split-second - all the time Sena needs to whip a DevilBat Ghost on him. Even that is not enough to put off the smug Naga, however - with his lightning-reaction time, he wheels round to have another shot at Sena. Agon then receives one of the greatest upsets of the entire game as his tackle to stop Eyeshield 21 is countered, and he is ground face-first into the turf! Since he was in a fit of rage, Agon had not considered the possibility that his shorter, weaker opponent would even try to down him.

In the game's dying seconds, Agon is the only person who realises what Hiruma's up to with Deimon's final drive. The final frame of the 194th Down shows his menacing stare behind the sports goggles he wears. At 18 seconds left in their final drive, Hiruma takes the snap and makes a fake spike to catch the Nagas off-guard. Yukimitsu stayed on the line of scrimmage for this play, which allowed Monta to go in motion. Thinking the play was dead because of the fake spike, Ikkyu (who was meant to be covering Monta) switched off - all the chance Monta needed to get a head start on him. Hiruma heaved a bomb in the air for him - which Ikkyu managed to get a hand to, but all he could do was deflect it directly into Monta's clutches. Agon, the only person who could see this coming, tackled the receiver at Shinry ji's red zone with 4 seconds left. During this, Monta shouted "CATCH MAX!" again, for all he already had the ball. Agon assumes that he meant catching the ball and arrogantly retorts that it didn't matter if he did catch the ball, as long as he was brought down. With the clock ticking inexorably down to 0, and Shinry ji still a touchdown up, it looks as if he had permanently ended Deimon's dream to play in the Christmas Bowl. Agon's plan was to let Monta get so far away that the rest of the Bats wouldn't have time to get back into formation for a spike. 

However, the referee ruled the play as out-of-bounds after seeing a lump of turf had been ripped up. Monta's scream of CATCH MAX! was nothing to do with the ball, as he already had hold of that - he was aiming to touch the sideline. He opened his fist and revealed the missing bit of turf. The ref has the clock reset to 4 seconds because of this. Now, with this being Deimon's final play, both Kongo brothers wonder what Hiruma is up to as the Deimon quarterback pumps Devil Bats' fans up into a frenzy. 

Apparently, the cheering crowds were just a diversion. Hiruma was actually going in motion as he ran side to side, pumping the crowd up. The play started unexpectedly when the ball was hiked directly to Sena. The Nagas were thrown off-guard again as it seemed that Sena would use the Devil Bat Ghost with the Nagas all over him. However, he lobbed the ball upwards. The Nagas were all in disbelief, as they had already covered all the receivers. Who would the ball go to? The crowd was also another distraction so that Sena could make a pass to.....Hiruma?! The Nagas were already in disbelief in the beginning, as the ball was hiked directly to Sena. After Hiruma caught the ball, Agon still arrogantly believed that he could catch up to Hiruma, since he remembered that Hiruma's best time at the 40-yard sprint was 5.2 seconds when he tried out for the Shinry ji Nagas. However, to his complete shock, he found out that Hiruma had gotten 0.1 seconds faster and that was all he needed to outrun him and score. Now the score is only 34-35 in favor of the Nagas as Deimon prepares to go for either a 1-point kick or a 2-point conversion.

Agon then receives the final insult and defeat as the one other Deimon member that he despises becomes instrumental in Deimon's two-point conversion play. No other team has ever scored a 2-point conversion against Shinry ji. Sena lined up on the extreme left of the line; the huddle before this play boiled down to his decision - take the kick and risk overtime with his failing legs, or risk the whole game and go for the win. This, combined with the Nagas' perfect record against 2-pointers, led all to believe that Deimon was going to go for the easy kick and take the game into OT. Indeed, Musashi came on for the kick and Hiruma went into a holder's position. 

Once again, however, it was a fake. Hiruma held the ball and picked it up, rushing with Musashi into the middle of Shinry ji's goal-line defense - behind Kurita who, through sheer determination and willpower, pushed Agon and Ikkyu diagonally, altering their centre of gravity, before they could get to the ball. Hiruma, meantime, lateralled the ball high into the air for Sena to catch and perform the Devil Bat Dive, thereby shattering the Nagas undefeated record both in games and 2-point conversions. Shocked and dejected, Agon leaves the field, and warns his teammates not to slack off on their training for the Spring Tournament, where he vows to defeat the Devil Bats.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES

God-Speed Impulse - This is Agon's innate talent which allows him to move and react with near-superhuman speed. However, this ability has a fatal weakness; it only works if he can SEE the movement. When Sena placed his hand on the side of Agon's helmet, this was round the back of it on his blind side, and Agon was unable to react to it in time. Also, he can use this ability to learn complex physical maneuvers in a short time.

 Dragon Fly and Golden Dragon Fly - See Unsui's entry.

Chop - Agon's preferred method of tackling. Using the side of his hand in a devastating chop, he can send most players to the turf groaning in pain. Would probably draw a flag and a double-digit penalty, and likely  an ejection for repeated offences, in the pros.

Imitation Devil Bat Ghost - Thanks to his God-Speed Impulse ability, Agon was able to copy Sena's move.

Ikky  Hosakawa.
The only person who has an attitude like Monta (but doesn't eat bananas like Monta does). His hair resembles Vegeta from the manga/anime series Dragon Ball Z, and he has a red mole in the middle of his forehead. By the look of him, no one should be intimidated, but his true skill lies in his running technique. He has the record of 4.9 seconds in the 40-yard-dash while running backwards, making him the best cornerback in the Kanto Zone. He is the only player on the Nagas that Agon has any respect for, since he is considered a genius. He has great respect for Agon and is probably the only one on the team who doesn't fear him and actually looks forward to playing with him. Ikkyu is proud of his jumping and catching ability. He tells Unsui that no one can beat him on air. However, Kanto's best cornerback is nothing compared to Japan's best linebacker- Shin proves this to him in his first match against him. 

He is always bullied by his teammates because he gets more remarks than they do. Ikkyu is one of the nicer, more friendly players on the team, but that doesn't make him any less serious when game time comes.  He's considered a genius with high-jump catches, but he is caught off-guard when Hiruma fakes a Hail Mary Pass and uses an incredibly fast and low bullet pass instead - Ichiro Takami of the Oujouu White Knights christens it a Hail Devil pass. He still intercepts it, but he gets the shock of his life when Monta strips the ball out of his hands, resulting in a Deimon touchdown. Like Agon is acting with Sena and Hiruma, Ikkyu is starting to lose his cool with Monta. He tried to face down the Deimon wideout after the touchdown, but Monta was unimpressed with Ikkyu's posturing.

Near the end of the game, Ikkyu begs for Unsui to let him have the ball, in order to make up for the upset that the Deimon receiver had caused. However his request is turned down in favor of just running out the clock. He does manage to deflect a pass that was meant for Monta and had a chance to catch a loose ball during Deimon's two-point conversion. However, in the end, he and the Nagas lose out to Deimon.

He seems to have a crush on Mamori; in his less serious moments, he sometimes tries to praise his upperclassmen, but his attempts are thwarted by his teammates, who practice a faux ventriloquist act on him, pretending to make him say such things as "in fact, you can't match the great Ikkyuu"--to which he's told "unforgivable...indeed unforgivable".

This is the American team that Deimon plays when they represent Japan. The whole team is white, because their coach, Leonard Apollo, is racist. The best player on the team, Panther, only picks up balls and is not allowed to play because of his previous mistake in a game and not following through with the coach's instructions, although it was later found out that this was merely a rationalization.
The Aliens first play a practice game against Zokugaku University's Frilled Lizards and slaughter them with a score of 73-0.
There was a bet before the game with Deimon and the terms were that if a team didn't win by more than 10 points, then that team would stay in the opposite country (Japan for NASA, US for Deimon). Deimon lost by one point (32-33), but only because they lacked a kicker and Sena was too exhausted to try the Devil Bat Dive at the end. Neither team succeeded in one-upping each other by 10 points. So Deimon went to America, while NASA stayed. In actuality, this was all according to Hiruma's plans since he wanted the Devil Bats to gain more experience against a veteran team and get some training in the United States.
The more muscular members of the Nasa Aliens have a habit of getting into a group pose and flexing their muscles, in which they believe show off their physiques to all female spectators, thereby getting them dates and such. So far, it hasn't worked.

Patrick "Panther" Spencer.

Panther is a good-natured person who has extraordinary running talents, but has been reduced to being a ballboy, due to Apollo's predjudice. He trains everyday by running across rooftops.  Panther's dream is to become a pro NFL player and make money so that his grandmother would no longer have to work. He is also one of the few people who is able to eat his grandmother's horrendous oatmeal recipe.

Initially, he wasn't interested in going to Japan since he really wanted to compete against Shin. Then he saw Eyeshield 21's running ability on Hiruma's web video and wanted to run against him. Eventually, he and Sena became good friends and promised to play on equal terms the next time they met on the field, (Sena was nearly at his limit by the time Panther had entered the game). 

Position: Running Back;
Jersey Number: 20;
40-Yard Dash: Unknown, but may be comparable to Sena's average of 4.5 seconds.

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES

Zero-Gravity Run - Panther's specialty is called the Zero-Gravity Run, which allows him to run at great speeds with extremely light footsteps. Unlike Sena's method of sharp turns and cuts, Panther can run like water, using the minimal amount of movement needed to slide around obstacles. Shin noted that Panther's running is too clean and easy to predict which route he will take.
Stiff-Arm - Panther also uses one hand to hold onto the ball, while the other is extended to ward off opposing blockers. This is a standard block used commonly by other Running Backs in the NFL. However, this gives his opponent a chance to slap the ball away, causing a fumble. Sena and Shin both show this flaw to him, and this teaches Panther that he needs to get more practice against opposing players.
Moon Salute - This strategy arranges the linemen in a crescent formation. This allows for maximum frontal protection for the Running Back. This is similar to Deimon's Sweeper tactic, but is done in a straight line rather than diagonally. The Aliens team had been developing this tactic for a long time without Apollo's knowledge.

Jeremy Watt.

Watt is the best Wide Receiver of the Nasa Aliens, and he also serves as team's translator, though he's more of a pseudo-Japan scholar (meaning that he's more of an otaku than a Japan-ophile). As a result, he often gets translations wrong, and has some misconceptions concerning Japanese culture. He is able to calculate the landing point for Homer's Shuttle Pass with pinpoint accuracy like Mission Control. Being taller and faster than Monta does give him an advantage over the Deimon Receiver.

Position: Wide Receiver;
Jersey Number: 81;
40-Yard Dash: 4.8 seconds;

Homer Fitzgerald.

Homer is the quarterback of the Nasa Aliens and his specialty is being able to heave a football from over half the length of the field. Along with Watt, he's one of Panther's closest friends, and helped him endure Apollo's racial attitude against African Americans. Homer's biggest problem is throwing control as the ball tends to go off-course. Another thing to note is that due to Homer's upper-body strength, tackling him at the waist is not enough to sack him. However, by going for his passing arm, his ability to throw the ball is stopped.  Given his large frame and powerful throwing arm, not to mention his tendency to misfire his passes, Homer could be modeled on Green Bay Packers quarterback, Brett Favre.

Position: Quarterback;
Jersey Number: 5;

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES

Shuttle Pass - The Shuttle Pass is considered the signature move of the team. Homer starts by counting down from three and throws the ball for his receiver to catch, usually near the goal line of the opposing team. The problem with this tactic is that it requires a longer time to initiate the pass, which leaves the quarterback open to blitzes that result in sacks. The Muscle Barrier, the name given to the line, is crucial in ensuring the success of the pass.

Gonzales (Big Brother).

The largest member on the Nasa Aliens, (even bigger than Kurita), he plays center on the line. His massive size and crushing power will reduce any lesser player to pulp. However, his slow speed makes it easy for faster opponents to dodge. His catch-phrase is "Big Useful!" Before going to Japan, he wanted to get a kanji tattoo which meant 'big and useful guy.' He asked Watt about the kanji for 'big' and 'useful.' However, (due to a mis-translation by Watt), when putting those two kanji together, the end result was POOP! In the end, his tattoo means Big Poop Guy. 

Position: Center/Guard;
Jersey Number: 50;

Gonzales (Little Brother).

Though lacking in size and overall strength of his sibling, the younger Gonzales makes up for it in speed and tenacity. He's about the same size as Komusubi. He admires his brother and wanted to be known as the Small Helpful Guy. In a way, he is to his big brother like Komusubi is to Kurita. His catch-phrase is, "Don't look down on me!" Unfortunately, he went to Watt for a kanji tattoo as well and the kanji for 'small' and 'helpful' translates as PEE, and that gives him the title of Little Pee Guy. He is also easily fooled by handoff fakes.

Position: Linebacker;
Jersey Number: 70;

Leonard Apollo.

Apollo is the coach of the Nasa Aliens team and has an extreme prejudice against those who have innate talents, rather than using skills earned by training. This is the main reason why he does not allow Panther to play during games and had him picking up balls. He's also racist against African Americans for their natural sprinting ability, and he dislikes the Japanese as well, thinking that they are weak and submissive as compared to the Americans. Due to this attitude, he cancels the game against the Devil Bats. 

In response to this, Hiruma creates an insulting web video. He sends it over the Internet, which directly calls Apollo a chicken for refusing to face Deimon and humiliates the Nasa coach worldwide. Outraged, Apollo reschedules their match, stating that if the Aliens do not crush the Devil Bats by at least 10 points, then the Americans would not return to the United States. 

In truth, the coach's real motivation for excluding Panther is really jealousy. It is a somewhat tragic story. In his days as an NFL player, Apollo, despite his considerable efforts (such as training three times more than anyone), was never more than a benchwarmer. When it looked like he would finally play, the bigwigs of his team hired Morgan, an extremely talented sprinter and, yes, an African American, much like Panther. He was cut from the team, and the flashback he had during the Deimon game showed him asking for one more chance, but being denied another chance. Bitter about it all, Apollo went on to found an ideal high school team that relied solely in perfectly executed and superior strategies without leaning on the performance of white talented aces. Also, whenever any one of the team members of the Nasa Aliens made a mistake, he would immediately be substituted. 

When Apollo's strategies during the Deimon game crumbled in front of Hiruma's tricks and Eyeshield's speed, Apollo reluctantly allowed Panther to play, after the whole team begged him to. Panther himself said that he would quit the team if he failed to stop Eyeshield and win the game if he were to be given "one more chance". This caused a flashback for Apollo. 

While Panther was playing on defense, Watt and Homer revealed that for a long time, despite how badly Panther was treated, Panther had always admired Apollo, because he was a hard-working man (Panther, like Apollo had, trained three times as hard as a ballboy and secretly with the rest of the team). There was another flashback of Panther when he was little, in which he declared that he had to be on Apollo's team no matter what. Despite the failure to win by ten points, the coach commented with his back turned during the hand-shaking that it was a good game. When the Alien's change their name to the NASA Shuttles and board a bus to leave Japan, Apollo reminded Panther of the deal, which Panther didn't exactly accomplish on his end ("Never call yourself a NASA Alien again"). However, Apollo told him that there would be a number 20 uniform for the Running Back (Panther) of the new "NASA Shuttles" team (#20 was Apollo's uniform number during his NFL days with the San Antonio Armadillos). This was the loophole which allowed the team to go back to America and let Panther play as a part of.

Position: Coach;

Bando Spiders.
Logo: Spider with a guitar;
Uniform and helmet designs feature spider's webs - black webs on a scarlet background, similar in design to the costume worn by Spider-Man.
This is the team that the Devil Bats face after losing to the Seibu Wild Gunmen in the qualifying eliminator for the Kantou championship. Monta believed all was lost after a play that could have gone either way was called in Seibu's favour, leading him to rage at a game official. It was following the end of the game that Hiruma let slip that they had another chance - by finishing third in the tournament. The 3rd/4th place repechage game is Deimon vs Bando. Deimon won 37-36.
The team has a philosophy of being a kick team, due to Koutarou Sasaki's kicking ability, and also because most of the original members of the Bando Spiders transferred to another school, leaving only the members of the kick formation left. This makes them take on an offensive stance like Deimon, in which one point can make all the difference. ;

Akaba Hayato.
The fullback for the Spiders.  Wears a blue tinted visor in his helmet, to set him apart from Sena's which is green. Originally believed by many to be the real Eyeshield 21, the ace from Notre Dame. Tall and thin, Hayato hardly looks like the intimadating figure of an ace player, leading many to underestimate him and his skills, and even Hiruma agrees he deserves the title of Eyeshield 21. In spite of his unimposing build, Hayato can send even Kurita flying with just his arms. He had first transferred out of Bando, but later decided to go back out of loyalty to his teammates. Due to school transfer policy, he was unable to play against Oujou, resulting in the Spiders losing. When he went against the Deimon team he almost single-handedly defeats Sena and Taki. However due to Taki getting serious, the Devil Bats are able to comeback and win. After getting defeated by Sena's lightspeed running, he graciously gives Sena his blue visor, telling him that he deserves to be called Eyeshield 21.

Like almost all the students at Bando, Akaba plays an instrument, in this case he plays guitar.
Akaba's eyes are naturally brown, he wears red contacts.
Position: Linebacker/Fullback ;
Jersey Number: 21;

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Spider Poison - By thrusting out with both arms and hitting the shoulders of his opponents, he is able to push them off and cause temporary numbness. The real key to this technique is that by studying the opposing teams in advance, Akaba learns when the opposing players' center of gravity shifts. By knowing this, and Akaba can push the opponent over with ease, no matter how strong they are. Since he also tells his entire team when the other players' center of gravity shifts, so they too implement this technique.

Run Force - By positioning the blockers in a certain way, Akaba can actually force the Running Back into moving where he wants him to go. This way, Akaba knows exactly where the Running Back will be so he can position himself ahead of time. This technique is similar or maybe even identical to Sena's ability to determine the most appropriate path to run.

Koutarou Sasaki.
(          Sasaki K tar ) The kicker for the Bando Spiders.  He is a direct rival of Musashi, and as noted by Hiruma, he has never missed a try-for-point kick. He even once kicked a soft drink can right into a rubbish bin made specifically for cans - off of a bridge railing. His skills as a kicker is seen when he could easily get a field goal from 50 yards.  It is because of him that the Bando Spiders adopted the philosophy of a kicking team, a team that relies on kicks to win the game. However, his accuracy can also be used against him since it's easy to predict where his kicks will land and they can then be returned.

Koutarou's most famous quote is, "That's smart." (Otherwise "That's not smart" etc.), and is seen combing his hair whenever he has time, even during a match. He seems to dislike Akaba Hayato because he keeps talking about music. Koutarou used up a time-out just to explain the history of the Spiders to Deimon. His last name is the same as a famous samurai, Sasaki Koujiro, a rival of Miyamoto Musashi. He seems to have asked Bando's manager, Sawai Juri (usually called "Julie"), who is also his childhood friend to go out with him 3 times, but was refused with "Whatever, stop saying stupid things, moron!", but she never actually said "No".

Position: Kicker;

Amino Cyborgs.
Mascot: Cyborg;
Team members dress like doctors off the field - facially, they have a very chiselled look similar to US comic book hero Captain Marvel - but are very strong and the only school using modern technology to grow stronger. They have a firm belief that victory can only be achieved through medical science, rather than spirit and determination. ;
They're known as the Tournament Breakers, since they always choose one sport every year to enter, and win the championship of that sport. Previously, it was soccer and basketball. The cheerleaders wear nurse outfits. ;
The Cyborgs make their first entry in the Autumn Kantou Tournament, where they faced the Devil Bats in Round One. However they failed to defeat Deimon, (8-38), even after Linebacker Munakata proclaims that he can defeat Eyeshield 21. The rest of the game was an easy win for the Devil Bats. Even though the sports medical science did make the Amino players stronger, they lacked the stamina and training to keep up with Deimon. Compared to the intensive Death March training, the whole Amino team, including the offensive and defensive players were panting while Deimon's players, who play both sides of the ball (offense and defense), weren't even tired.

Atsushi Munakata.

The team captain and Linebacker of the Amino Cyborgs. He was also the team captain of Amino's basketball and soccer clubs, winning the championships of those as well. He's a massively built player with a politician's personality. However, he had made a serious mistake during the summer in which the Devil Bats were in the United States. He had assumed that Eyeshield 21 would be the same as he was during the Spring Season, so he had practiced to counter Sena's habit of stopping before accelerating. However, during the Cyborg's first and ONLY Fall Game, he was soundly defeated by the Devil Bat Ghost. He soon suffers a nervous breakdown as his faith in medical science is shattered.

Position: Linebacker;
Jersey Number: 29;

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Route Direction - Both Shin and Panther instinctively use this technique to lead opposing players toward them. Munakata shifts his position slightly in order to get the runner to go in the opposite direction, then Munakata tackles the player as he slows down for the turn. This method is nothing against the Devil Bat Ghost since Sena doesn't slow down at all and can change his direction in an instant.

Suguru Aoyanagi.

He used to be a scrawny student until he took the Amino Training Program for 6 months. This included going to the gym twice a week and taking an unbelievable amount of vitamin supplements and whatever else medical science could provide. He thought that he was unstoppable, and in the first few minutes of the game against Deimon, it seemed to be true. Then the Devil Bats' trainer reminded them of the proper techniques, and Suguru was crushed along with the rest of the Amino Line. He also suffers a breakdown as the muscles he gained through medical science fails against the Hah Brothers.

Position: Lineman;
Jersey Number: 64;

Kadoguchi.

Kadoguchi's face seems to be made up of polygons and he moves like a stiff robot. He trained himself to run by using motion-capture videos, in order to attain the 'perfect running form.' However, this means absolutely nothing when going up against Monta and his catching ability. Compared to the Devil Bat Receiver's drive to be the best at catching, Kadoguchi gave up too easily when the ball seemed out of reach.

Position: Cornerback;

Kyoshin Poseidon.

Uniform: colour scheme similar to the Seattle Seahawks - greyish-blue and green.
Uniform detail is of scales down the side of the uniform;
Helmet logo is a pair of fins, one on each side;
The team's Cheerleading Squad Captain, Otohime is said to have a crush on Kengo Mizumachi because of his pure (and immature) heart, and apparently joined the club because of a diet.
The team is highly focused on using its members' height to their advantage, both in stopping passes and runs from their rivals, making them a defensive team. ;
Unexpectedly, this team manage to defeat the strong Hashiratani Deer in their first match by gaining 31 points without letting Hashitarani Deer get any more points after sending out their team's secret weapon. Defeated the Zokugaku Chameleons in their second match and lost to Deimon Devil Bats by one point.
During their match against Deimon, Oujouu's Takami comments that Hiruma is Deimon's true 'hidden ace', due to his ability to make instantaneous decisions on who to pass to, as well as his tactical knowledge.
Kengo Mizumachi.
(      Mizumachi Kengo) The third tallest player on the team and a natural athlete.  Was on the swimming team but quit due to the lack of challenge.  Plays on the line and uses his height and speed from a "swimmer's start" to great advantage.  He has a bad habit of saying inappropriate and insensitive remarks. He is also known to strip down to his boxers in front of people, and seems to hate football equipment, saying that "It's too heavy, I can't move properly". Apparently, modesty is not an issue. Initially, he looks down (no pun intended) on Komusubi of the Deimon team due to how short he is, but learns there is a lot of strength in Komusubi's small frame and was defeated by him at the end of the game. Also, Mizumachi seems to understand Powerful-go, the "true language of truly strong men," as he responded positively to Komusubi's post-game grunt of "HOT!". He also likes swimming and spying on the females' half of the bathhouse when the Kyoshin team relaxes, stating that "The only thing to do when you go to a public bathhouse is to swim or peek, right?".

Jersey Number: 71;
Position: Tackle/ Defensive End;

TECHNIQUES/STRATEGIES
Swimmer's Start - Mizumachi assumes the position that Olympic swimmers use on the starting block. This lowers his center of gravity and allows him to spring forward, much like Komusubi can with his Fast Start technique. However, Mizumachi's method has a fatal flaw. As soon as he brings his arm upward in the 'swim' position, his chest is exposed and he is slightly off-balance. This allows Komusubi to knock him down like a bowling pin.

Formation: Poseidon - Mizumachi leaves the line and joins Kakei and the other linebackers behind the defensive line. Though this weakens the line, it strengthens the passing defense, while Kakei controls the opponents run. This formation can be summed up as as a 3-4 defense, where a defensive linemen leaves the line and joins the linebackers(3 linemen and 4 linebackers).

Shun Kakei.
 The fourth tallest player on the team and the de facto captain.  Went to school in America for a year and met the real Eyeshield 21. This was during his middle school years, and at that time, he had lost interest in American Football, until he went up against Notre Dame's Eyeshield 21. The encounter inspired him to train with new enthusiasm as he promised to meet up with him again at the finals. However, when the game against Notre Dame finally came around, Eyeshield 21 was nowhere to be found. Shun asked around for his whereabouts, but no one seemed to know who he was or even if he existed. Shun claimed that Sena was a fake, since the Eyeshield he knew was far taller. He then declared to defeat the Devil Bat's imposter. He later admits that Sena is deserving of the title of Eyeshield 21 and tells him to keep fighting until the final game. And he's like the Shin of the team except he has shinier hair and is actually more serious than Shin. Shun seems to be used to his teammates immature actions. He is so use to it, he can even ignore the fact that Sena, Monta and his other teammates were trying to stop Mizumachi from peeking at the bathhouse (and making a big fuss out of it), who were then pushed right through the wall by Urashima, Kyoshin's cheerleader vice captain, even saying calmly, "Yes, Akaba Hayato's block is as powerful as that".

Jersey Number: 41.
Position: Linebacker;

STRATEGIES/TECHNIQUES
One Handed Block- Shun sticks his hand out and blocks the opponent down by way of pushing him in the face. This move is similar to the now illegal "Head Slap Maneuver" used by former NFL player, Deacon Jones;

Moby Dick Anchor- Shun uses both of his arms and tackles his opponent in a cross grapple across the waist similar to Shin's Double Spear tackle. Shun was able to stop Sena's Devil Bat Ghost with this move, however, it was ineffective against the Devil Bat Tornado.

High Wave - This strategy assembles all tall players at the scrimmage line and has them leap upwards simultaneously, thereby preventing the opposing quarterback from passing. It is also used for defensive blocking against a run. However, this strategy is countered by Hiruma's Wishbone tactic.

Kobanzame Osamu.
Kobanzame is the short, nervous captain of the Poseidons. Unlike the underclassmen on the team, Kobanzame and the other members in their last year are unusually short. During the match against the Deers, the announcer mentioned that the Deer and the Poseidons were two of the shortest teams in the league. This was until the Poseidons revealed their new freshmen who used their height to their advantage. Kobanzame is a comic character who has a tendency to stutter and mess up quotations in his attempts to raise the morale on the team. You first see him when he travels with another upperclassman (or Ohira and Onishi in the anime) to go spy on Deimon's training. When his friend protests that they should not be doing something underhanded, Kobanzame claimed that there was no harm in simply taking a peek as they happened to walk by. While climbing up the fence to get a better view, however, he was hit in the head by a ladder during Monta's attempt to imitate Mizumachi's height. 

Kobanzame's spying did allow him to recognize Sena right away when Hiruma sent him disguised as a delivery boy to the Poseidon's clubhouse. Kobanzame immediately called Sena on his deception (ignoring that he had done the same just hours before...the lump remaining on his head to prove it) and brought the the Devilbat to Kakei's attention. This later led Sena to learn more about Kakei's personal feelings towards the 'fake' Eyeshield 21 from Kakei himself as well as being expanded upon by Mizumachi.

Kobanzame's relationship to the other Poseidons is revealed through several flashbacks in the manga as well as their conversations. According to the author, Kobanzame is ranked second in the series in terms of shyness. Only Sena himself is worse. Because of this, he is often unsure of what to do and will wait for Kakei to decide on something before saying ' Right, that is exactly what I was thinking' and trying to maintain his role as captain. He has a tendency to complain a lot, but Kakei mentioned that Kobanzame was the only other Poseidon to complete the same hellish amount of training as Mizumachi. Mizumachi and Kobanzame seem to be fairly close to one another, and Mizumachi even attempts to convince Sena that the Poseidons deserve to win the game more because the Devil Bats have no third years on their team, while many of the Poseidons, including Kobanzame, are in their last year. Of course, Mizumachi did not realize that it was the last year for the second years from Deimon as well, since they have a no-play policy in their third year. When the Devil Bat/Poseidon match comes down to one final play to determine the game, Kobanzame confesses to Kakei and the others in a joking manner that once again he is forced to sit uselessly on the bench while they do all the hard work. This surprises his team mates who have never even considered the possibility that Kobanzame and the other upperclassmen have been holding them back. They promise to bring Kobanzame his ticket to the finals and head out to the field, leaving Kobanzame alone to think about all the times he tried to make up for his lackluster abilities by doing other things such as gathering information on the Poseidon's opponents and boosting morale. Of course, the Poseidons lose, and Mizumachi feels so dejected that he starts wailing on the field because the dreams of the third years are over. Kobanzame, overcome by emotion, concludes the match by saying that eighth is not so bad and that even though the last summer was the hardest in his life, it was also the best. 

Kobanzame unfortunately does have a poor body unsuited for football. He is short, slow, and weak. However, he does have the skill to be a quarterback, and is sort of a quietly skilled player that is overshadowned (literally and figuratively) by his larger than life team mates. In the entire tournament, he has never been intercepted. His passes are always accurate, and much like Hiruma he can react quickly when an opponent attempts to take the ball. His quick reaction time is more driven by fear than quick thinking, however. Takami even praised Kobanzame, calling him a good quarterback. In the anime the Devil Bats managed to intercept his pass when Hiruma, in true Hiruma style, frightened Osamu so badly he threw the ball too fast and the Devil Bats were ready to catch it.

Ohira Hiroshi.
Introduced part-way into the Kyoshin-Deimon match.  At a height of 205 cm, he's the tallest high school football player.  He is introduced alongside Onishi (below), both of whom immediately begin bickering about who is 'Kakei-sensei's first disciple'.  He has short and spiky black hair, and has very large eyebrows that seem to extend down to the tops of his eyes.  He also appears to be very passionate.  He is a first year student.  The kanji used in his name are the same as those for the Pacific Ocean.  Evidently, he and Onishi have been rivals since before they joined the football team, and compete over useless things, such as 'who pulled more all-nighters' and 'who studied less for an exam'.  Upon witnessing Kakei's skill, however, they were motivated to play football and learn from him.

Yuuhi Guts.
Logo: A burning sun over an ocean horizon. The sun has angry eyes on it.
Uniform and Helmet Designs: Light brown with orange flames on the bottom of the jerseys. Helmets have a sun pattern on the tops. Team colours out of uniform are maroon and gold - close to the Washington Redskins when they wear their throwback gear.
Their team chant is "Patience, Determination, Endurance!";
Yuuhi High is famous for having ace teams in all sports except for American Football. As a result, the team is made of mediocre players with low morale, little to no club funds, second-hand equipment, and a small team roster (about 10 players).
 The team is considered weak as compared to the other clubs at Yuuhi, but this fact only spurs them to train harder. Training sessions include marathons on the beach in loincloths, squat-jumping up and down steps, towing tractor tires behind them and so forth. ;
They go against Deimon in the Fall Tournament and lose miserably (7-56), but one should take note that the coach had used aces from the other sports teams while benching the regulars. When it was apparent that the aces couldn't win against the Devil Bats, the regulars were allowed to play and they did manage a touchdown (in the manga).
In the anime, the aces scored the touchdown while the regulars only managed first down, but they still showed a better performance and dedication than the aces. ;

Atsumi Daisuke.

The team captain of Yuuhi Guts as well as the Quarterback. He's been leading the members though a series of intense training for 3 years, though it's not like the Death March the Devil Bats underwent. Atsumi is considered slightly below average as a player, (or as Hiruma put it, he's the best of the worst), and the Devil Bat quarterback gave Atsumi's team a 1% chance of beating Deimon. He seems very grounded, and is one of the few players shown that sees through Hiruma's 'scare tactics' immediately (like Kid).

When the coach decided to replace the regulars with aces from the other sports clubs, (soccer, sumo, karate, baseball, etc), Atsumi reluctantly agreed that they had better skills. At that point, Hiruma dropped Yuuhi's chances of winning down to 0. A newly-formed team of aces couldn't deal with Deimon's explosive offense power and the addition of their tight end, Taki. By half-time, the Yuuhi Guts were trailing by more than 20 points.

The other players, knowing that Atsumi really wants to face Deimon, feign injury and illness, and the coach eventually gives up, allowing Atsumi and the rest of the real football team to enter the game. They managed to put up a better showing than their replacements, even though they still lost by 50 points. At the end of the game, the Guts members cheer Deimon on to win the championship. 

Position: Quarterback/Safety;
Jersey Number: 9;

Konzo Katsuko.

She's the team manager and one-girl cheerleader squad of the Yuuhi Guts. She helps train the players and fixes up all of the second-hand equipment that they are forced to use. She can get extremely pumped up while trying to boost team morale. She is often seen waving the team flag, holding a megaphone and most noticeably, wearing burûmâ, (the Japanese version of bloomers). She believes in Atsumi and also takes part in some of the training sessions with the team members. According to the manga, it is rumoured that she is being scouted by Zokuto University as their first cheerleader squad member, due to her intensity at cheering on the team to win. 

Position: Team Manager/Cheerleader;

Haibara.

Haibara is one of the linemen of the Yuuhi Guts, in which Atsumi places his faith in, since he does have a solid knowledge of blocking. Haibara is also frustrated that the team has no club funds and is considered weak, despite their constant efforts at training. When Hiruma decided to rattle the Yuuhi Guts at the beginning of the game, Haibara could only say in frustration that he is honored that the Devil Bats would show their full strength, while the 'true Yuuhi Guts' could not (meaning that all the members of the football team were replaced by other teams' members).

Position: Lineman/Guard;
Jersey Number: 14;

Dokubari Scorpions.

Logo: Scorpion;
Uniforms and Helmets: Black with white trim on the jerseys. Helmets have the scorpion logo imprinted on the side.
This team did very well in the Spring Season with 10 wins and one loss. The things to note are that they won five games by forfeit, while the other games were won by taking out the opposing team's aces.
They were able to win so many games by predicting the actions of their opponents.
The Scorpions face off against Deimon in the third round, but their style of play proved to be no match against Hiruma's deceit. They lose with a score of 12-42 in the anime, 0-42 in the manga.

Kanagushia.

He's the team captain and safety. His belief is that football is a mind game. He wears his long hair in a braid that stands up like a scorpion's tail whenever he's excited or angry. Kanagushia is able to predict the opposing team's strategies by reading the telltale signs of the players. Things such as glances, body movements and certain behaviors allow him to figure out what kind of play the other team will use. However, Hiruma already knew about Kanagushia's strategies and used several tricks (including lipstick), and his own brand of psychological warfare to confound him. In the end, the Scorpions were stung by their own poison.  In an omake, it shows that he's slapped around frequently by his father ("I've predicted your movements!  You're going to slap me on my left cheek now, aren't you?"), who's often annoyed by his abrasive personality; so, while he can predict the movements of others, it's somewhat useless.

Position: Safety;
Jersey Number: 14;

 Hakushuu Dinosaurs .
Logo: A tyrannosaurus with stripes down its back;
Uniform: Similar to the Cincinnati Bengals, in design at least; colours are as yet unknown. Thick slashes of a dark colour adorn the whole jersey and helmets.  Two eyes peer out on the front of the helmets as well, and a row of sharp teeth are just above the facemask.

Very little has been revealed on this team until recently.  In a newspaper article after the Spring tournament, they were mentioned alongside Deimon (and below tournament mainstays like Shinryuji, Oujou, Seibu and Taiyo) as a "Team to Watch", particularly due to some "massive new talent" that they had recruited.  As they had made it to the final eight of the Kantou tournament, the team is slowly being revealed, possibly as a potential final opponent in the Kantou final for the Devil Bats.  After thrashing the Taiyo Sphinx in the quarterfinals by a halftime score of 32-0, and forcing the Sphinx to forfeit due to a lack of players fit to continue, the team will be playing the Seibu Wild Gunmen in the semifinals, with the winner taking on the Deimon/Oujou winner in the Christmas Bowl. With the talent - or should that be raw power - that has been revealed thus far, it seems the road to the Christmas Bowl for Oujouu or Deimon goes through Hakushuu.

 Maruko (Marco) .
The Dinosaurs quarterback, who told Sena and Monta to call him Marco instead of Maruko, because Maruko is a female name (in Japan 'ko' is primarily a feminine name ending), and "Marco" sounds like a male Italian name. He wanted the strong teams to knock each other out so his team could take it easy, so he offered to switch with Deimon. But just then Oujouu's Ootawara drew out number "7" (Deimon had 5), Deimon would meet Oujouu in the semifinals, so he told them to forget it. He was especially glad he didn't switch when the Nagas drew number "6" which meant that they would face the Devil Bats first.

After the Devil Bats defeat the Nagas, his personality takes on a more confident attitude, partly due to fact that he didn't have to face off against the former Kantou champions, and partly because his team has a new monstrous lineman that holds the record for the bench press (200 kg). Marco said during an interview that he likes girls with love.

Position: Quarterback;

Rikiya Ga .
The gigantic lineman playing for the Dinosaurs, he holds the record for bench press in all of Japan (200+ kg) and whose appearance even scares the similarly massive Taiyou lineman Banba. He's larger than any other player shown in the series and is reported to have sent all of his opponents' quarterbacks to the hospital. A regular plastic mouthpiece will not work, since he'll chew it to bits like gum. He uses a titanium alloy mouthpiece. His power is gradually being revealed as he begins to play against Taiyo. His first devastating move in the Tournament was breaking through the Sphinx's newest formation, the Tutankhamen Mask, and pushing down Banba and Harao with ease. By half-time, with the score 32-0 in favor of the Dinosaurs, the entire Taiyou line was out of the match due to injuries from trying to hold Ga  back. The most devastating loss was with Banba as he was carried away on a stretcher. As a result, the Sphinx team was forced to surrender the game.

Surprisingly, Ga  showed a sense of honor rather than being depicted as a wholly violent brute. He admired Banba for his determination to protect the quarterback, even though Harao had long given up the will to win. Hiruma and Kid also noticed that there was more to Ga  than meets the eye, stating that the huge lineman was not suffering from a lack of control of his strength, but rather that Ga  didn't FEEL like controlling it.

After the quarterfinal match, he nearly lost it when one of the fans openly threw insults at Banba, (this was the same arrogant soccer player that Monta and Sena had mistaken for Musashi--Muro Satoshi). This made Ga  lose his temper, causing him to rip off the steel guardrails of the stadium seats and charge into the bleachers. He would have trampled anyone who got in his way and most likely would have crushed the cowardly soccer player. But before he could get to the fan, Riku from the Seibu Wild Gunmen ran to his aid, protecting him and standing up to the monstrous player.  It appears that the two will meet again in the semi-finals when Hakushuu and Seibu play each other.

It seems that, now Agon and the Naga have been knocked out of Kantou, Ga  and the Dinosaurs are being lined up as the next 'boss'-style character and team that Sena and the Bats will square off against (that is, if they manage to overcome the White Knights in the semis and the Dinosaurs defeat Seibu).

Benchpress: 200 kg (high school record);
Position: Lineman;
Jersey Number: 70;

Misaki Wolves.

Logo: Wolf;
Uniforms and Helmets: The colour is currently unknown, but the shoulders and chest of the jersey bear parallel 'gashes', mimicking wolves' claws.  The helmets have a wolf's head on either side.
Very little is shown of this team.  The team leader, Kamiya Taiga, is one of the players interviewed by Kumabukuro Riko shortly before the match against the Shinryuuji Naga.
The Wolves hail from Hokkaido; their introduction at the tournament lottery says that they "make their way across the land with their fangs, claws and speed".
This is the first team the Seibu Gunmen play against at the Kantou Tournament, though they are largely a joke; when Riku faces Ga  after the Hakushuu-Taiyou match, they loosely promise to meet at the next level, while the Wolves protest feebly in the background that they have yet to play against Seibu.

Kamiya Taiga.

The Wolves' captain.  His position is unclear.  He often boasts about his long legs, which help him to run faster.  He has short, light-colored hair, much like Riku's, a horizontal scar across his nose, and a fang poking out of his mouth at all times.  From the interview with Kumabukuro's daughter, he appears confident to the point of arrogance, saying "You can see my strong point right here, can't you?  It's these long legs," while some of the other players decline to mention their advantages (Shin, Marco, and Kid).  When asked what players he would watch out for, he says, "Myself! --is probably not the right thing to say ... Agon?  Though I'm stronger than he is."  Speed appears to be his only tactic.  Before the game with Seibu, he also says "The level of my lead makes it feel like 'Kamiya Wolves' already ... Being called the quick shooter gunman, is it some joke?  With these long legs, I'll give you instant death."  This joke, of course, is overturned on them, as Seibu wins by a large margin (the scoreboard shows 82-14 with some time left in the match).

The Duchess of Kent is the woman who is married to the Duke of Kent, as the actual peerage is a male position.

The present holder of the title is Katharine, The Duchess of Kent (formerly Katharine Worsley) by virtue of her marriage to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.

The last before her to have the title was Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. The other famous Duchess of Kent was the mother of Queen Victoria, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. There has not been another Duchess of Kent because Kent did not become a dukedom until the year 1710, promoting Henry Gray, 12th Earl of Kent to the rank of Duke. He died without marriage or issue, so the dukedom became extinct until it was revived as a new creation for one of the sons of King George III, Prince Edward Augustus Hanover, who was the father of Queen Victoria.

<doc id="7111021" title="Ann Bassett" nonfiltered="505" processed="501" dbindex="450508">
Ann Bassett (May 12, 1878-May 8, 1956) also known as Queen Ann Bassett, was a female outlaw and rancher of the Old West, and one of the two sisters that became known as The Bassett Girls.

Early life.
Bassett was born to Herb Bassett and Elizabeth Chamberlain Bassett near Browns Park, but in Utah, the second of two daughters, her sister Josie being born in 1874. Herb Bassett was twenty years senior to Elizabeth Chamberlain Bassett, and the couple moved to Browns Park some time around the early 1870s. 

Herb Bassett had a profitable cattle ranch which straddled both Utah and Wyoming, and partly in Colorado, and often did business with notable outlaws of the era, such as Butch Cassidy, Kid Curry, and Black Jack Ketchum, selling them horses and beef for supplies. Both Ann and Josie Bassett were attractive young women, well taught by their father in the arts of horse riding, roping, and shooting. Both were educated early on in prominent boarding schools, and were intelligent and articulate in their speech, but both chose to return to the life of ranching.

By the time Ann Bassett was 15, she had became involved romantically with Butch Cassidy. Her sister, Josie, also dated members of the gang, to include Elzy Lay. Outlaws Ben Kilpatrick and Will "News" Carver, who were both later members of the Wild Bunch gang, also dated the sisters. It was through these associations that Bassett was first exposed to the outlaw life.

Outlaw life.
In 1896, several cattle barons in the area made attempts to purchase the Bassett ranch from the Bassett's. When they refused, several began to rustle their cattle. Ann Bassett and her sister Josie in turn rustled cattle from the opposing cattle barons. This led to a feud, and resulted in the cattlemen bringing in killer for hire Tom Horn to deal with what the wealthy cattlemen deemed to be rustlers. Horn did eliminate several known rustlers during that time, and later he did kill two known rustlers who were known to be associated with the Bassett family, Islam Dart and Matt Rush, in 1900. However, Horn did not take any actions against the Bassett's, and his killing of Dart and Rush was due to another matter unrelated to the Bassett issue.

By 1896, Josie Bassett was heavily involved in a relationship with Elzy Lay, Cassidy's closest friend. Josie had also became involved with Cassidy shortly after his release from an eighteen month prison sentence, during which time Ann was involved with Ben Kilpatrick. When Elzy Lay began a relationship with a woman named Maude Davis, Josie became involved with Will "News" Carver, and Ann returned to her involvement with Cassidy. Through their relationships with the outlaws, and in exchange for their supplying the outlaws with beef and fresh horses from their ranch, the two sisters were in a position to get assistance from Cassidy and his gang in dealing with certain cattlemen who were pressuring them to sell. 

This association was a deterrent that kept cowboys hired to harass the sisters from doing so, for fear of retribution from the outlaws. There was even one report that Kid Curry, easily the most feared member of the Wild Bunch gang, once paid a visit to several cowboys known to be employed by the cattlemen, warning them to leave the Bassett's alone. That cannot be confirmed, but although the problems with the wealthy cattlemen's association continued well into 1902, by late 1899 the problems were rare, and there was little pressure placed on the sisters to sell their ranch. Despite the seemingly constant changes in romantic partners by both the Bassett sisters and the gang members, there is no report of there ever being any animosity as a result of this, and it seemed to simply be the accepted way that things were. 

Although both sisters were taking part in the fight against the powerful cattlemen's associations, it was Ann that had became best known, and newspapers as well as friends had dubbed her "Queen Ann Bassett". In early 1897, Bassett joined Cassidy at "Robbers Roost". Elzy Lay, having ended his relationship with Josie Bassett, joined them with his girlfriend Maude Davis. According to reports of the day, Bassett and Davis were two of only five women ever allowed into the "Robbers Roost" hideout, the other three being Josie Bassett, the Sundance Kids girlfriend Etta Place, and Wild Bunch gang member Laura Bullion. 

By April, 1897, the two women were sent home so Cassidy and his gang could concentrate on their next robbery. Cassidy would continue his romantic involvement with Bassett off and on for another four years, seeing her whenever he was near her ranch. The total length of their relationship was around seven years, but was interrupted often with his being away, and for an eighteen month period when he was in prison starting in 1894, during which time she was involved with Ben Kilpatrick.  

By 1903 Bassett had married a rancher by the name of Henry Bernard. Shortly after the marriage, she was arrested for cattle rustling. She stood trial, but was acquitted and released. The marriage lasted six years, ending in divorce, with Bernard helping Bassett and her sister Josie in maintaining their ranch.

Bassett girls in later life.
By 1904, most of the outlaws associated with the Bassett Girls were either dead or had been captured by lawmen. Ann Bassett never saw Cassidy again after he first departed for South America. Josie Bassett is alleged to have been involved off and on with Will Carver until he was killed by lawmen in 1901. Several other outlaws from lesser known gangs drifted in and out of the ranch, usually visiting only to obtain beef or fresh horses, and have a place to stay for a few days. Elzy Lay reportedly visited the ranch again in 1906, shortly after his release from prison, before moving on to California where he lived out the remainder of his life as a respectable businessman. Herb Bassett died on July 30, 1918. 

Ann Bassett remarried in 1928 to cattleman Frank Willis. The couple remained in Utah, where they began ranching, and where she remained for the rest of her life. Willis reportedly loved her dearly, and the two worked closely together in their business. Before she died, she requested that she be cremated, and that her remains be spread across her birthplace in northern Utah. However, Willis is alleged to have grieved greatly over her death, and was unable to complete that task, keeping her ashes in his car for the remainder of his life. When he died in 1963, their family buried Ann Bassett's ashes in an undisclosed location in Browns Park.

Josie Bassett lived most of her life on her fathers property, operating the ranch, and choosing a mostly outdoor life, with camping, fishing and hunting being her primary hobbies. She eventually moved, in 1913, to a homestead near Vernal, Utah, where she began ranching. Josie was romantically linked to many outlaws of the late 19th century, and some prominent men of the early 20th century, and married five times. During the 1930s she became well known for supplying beef at no cost to families in need during the Great Depression. She also bootlegged whiskey during that time. In later life she was described as a reclusive eccentric, often talking to neighbors about the days of excitement in her youth.

The alleged Ann Bassett-Etta Place connection.
Ann Bassett has often been accused of having actually been Etta Place, the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid, and who mysteriously disappeared from all public records in 1909 not long after his death. According to the reports, Bassett had led a double life, dating Cassidy as Ann Bassett, and dating the Sundance Kid as Etta Place. Some speculation even indicates that she was involved with both outlaws at the same time, of course with their full knowledge, and that by 1900, when in their company, she simply went by the name of Etta Place. 

However, although they were likely close in age, the dates do not match up when comparing Place's time in South America. At the time, there are documented instances showing Bassett to have been in Wyoming and Colorado. Pinkerton reports give almost identical descriptions of both women, listing both with classic good looks, articulate speech and intelligence, the same hair color, describing both as being good with a rifle and riding a horse, and describing both as being promiscuous with both having taken several lovers. Author and researcher Doris Karren Barton indicates in her 1992 book, "Queen Ann Bassett: Alias Etta Place" that often when Bassett is absent from historical records, Place is actively traveling with Cassidy and the Sundance Kid/Harry Longabaugh, and when Place is absent from historical records, Bassett is visible. 

However, Barton excludes the fact that when Place was most definitely in South America with Cassidy and Longabaugh in 1903, Bassett was most definitely under arrest for cattle rustling in Utah, and recently married. Place had without a doubt departed for South America with Longabaugh in August, 1902, not to return to the United States, specifically New York City, until the summer of 1904. Bassett was most definitely married, incarcerated, tried, and released over a span of several months in 1903. 

When comparing the only legitimate photograph of Place with the best photograph of Bassett, the two women do look similar. Both are pretty, with similar facial features, hair color, and physical build. However, most Historians discount the claims, and they were actually two separate people, not one in the same. Ann Bassett and Etta Place definitely knew one another, and were alleged to have been at the "Robbers Roost" hideout at the same time on more than one occasion, but they were not the same person. 

It is more likely, although also prone to inconsistencies, that Etta Place could have actually been a brothel owner named Eunice Gray, who established that business in Fort Worth, Texas around 1909. Gray died in a fire in 1962. Prior to that, there were at least two people who could have confirmed as to whether Place was in fact Eunice Gray. Female Wild Bunch gang member Laura Bullion was one. She died in 1961. The last known person who actually knew Etta Place, and who could have confirmed as to whether Eunice Gray actually was Etta Place was Ann's sister, Josie, who died in 1963. There are no indications that she was ever asked to do so.

Charles Fane, 2nd Viscount Fane (c. 1708   c. 24 January 1766)
sometimes refered to as Charles Lord Viscount Fane

He was buried at Lower Basildon, Berkshire, 31 January 1766

Eldest son of Charles, 1st Viscount Fane by his wife Mary (1686-1762) daughter of the envoy hon. Alexander Stanhope, FRS and sister of soldier-statesman James, 1st Earl Stanhope (1673-1721).

Fane was educated at Eton c1718-25, and in Geneva which was part of his 1726-1729 European tour.
He was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary (British Resident) to the Tuscan court in March 1734, with an annual salary of 1,300 pounds.
He was in Florence in person between 3 October 1734 and spring 1738, when (Sir) Horace Mann, his deputy, replaced him.

A friend and follower of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford (1710-1771) he was an Opposition Whig Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock from 1734 to 1747, and a Member for Reading from 1754 to 1761.
At the 18 April 1754 poll, after a remarkably expensive contest, Fane only seemed to beat the third placed contestant, the court Whig, John Dodd, by one vote, 296 to 295. Dodd petitioned against Fane's return. Bedford and Pitt organised Fane's defence.

He joined White's Young Club  (a sub-set of the original) in it foundation year 1743.

On 7 June 1749 Fane married at St Benet Paul's Wharf, Susanna, Lady Juxon (1706-10 April 1792, at Curzon street).
She was the youngest daughter of John Marriott, Registrar of the Court of Chancery, of Stuston Hall, near Diss in Suffolk, and of Sonning in Berkshire.
In 1726 she had married Sir William Juxon, 2nd Bt (dsp1739/40) of Little Compton in Gloucestershire, the heir and great nephew of Archbishop Juxon.
As a widow she lived at Little Compton and at Fane's house in Curzon street.

Fane is in two of the monumental hunting scenes by John Wootton in the Hall at Althorp. They were commissioned by Charles Spencer, third Duke of Marlborough and fifth Earl of Sunderland in 1733/34. When Lord Sunderland's youngest brother hon. Jack Spencer died in 1746, their old school friend Fane became guardian of the son, the future 1st Earl Spencer.

Fane's still extant lease-hold dwelling-house on the north side of Curzon street was bought from Elizabeth Shepherd in 1753. He negotiated with the ground landlord (Nathaniel Curzon) for a wider site and added the two-bow fronted wings. The house was given up on the death of his widow in 1792. In 1984 the Saudi Arabian government bought it, by then known as Crewe House, for its embassy, paying 37million pounds.

Fane died without issue so his estates, after considering his widow, were divided between his surviving sisters, Mary, wife to Jerome de Salis, and Dorothy wife of John, fourth Earl of Sandwich. 
The mansion house and estate at Basildon was sold to a Nabob and the great house was replaced by a bijoux Palladian villa, Basildon Park. His mother's grotto down the hill at the Thames-side New House soon disappeared, though the house still stands.
The lands in Armagh and Limerick were retained. They were finally partitioned in 1806.

Doonee (or Duni) is a brand new sport which goal is to exchange an especial ball named COR, in a rectangular court, divided by two parallel nets. The ball can only be touched by hand and,  its weight varies depending on the players category. The main purpose of Doonee is to promote and support a no-violence behavior, which is so needed nowadays in a world with a lot of Violence in sports. Doonee's main feature lays in its five fundamental laws:

Fundamental laws.
The COR is never stroked, punched, kicked, or so on. (Universal Law of NO-VIOLENCE).
The COR is never stopped. (Universal Law of PERPETUAL MOVEMENT).
The COR keeps the same  during the match. (Universal Law of  CONSERVATION OF THE ENERGY).
The COR can only be throwed describing curved lines. (Universal Law of  CURVE OF LIFE).
The COR can neither be slowed down, nor stopped. (Universal Law of NO-RESISTANCE).

The Ball (COR).
The two main aspects of the Doonee's BALL are:
It's a HOLLOW ball.
It's a BALL which weight ranges from some grams to several kilograms, depending on the category of the Doonee players in a match.



History.
Doonee was born as a sport during 1973 in Argentina, and is the final result of an in-depth analysis and study of more than 200 sports, made by its own creator. So far Doonee is played in several countries such as; USA, MEXICO, CHILE and SPAIN, and is still spreading world wide.

Mission.
Doonee's mission is mainly to claim for itself the title of  NO-VIOLENCE SPORT, which is a lacking component in the rest of the sports played by the humanity.

Benefits.
The benefits of playing Doonee are among others:
Physical training by exercising legs, arms and back.
Improvements in the body balance.
Improvements in the speed of the reflexes response.
Increase of the concentration.

John McIntosh (March 4 1796   July 3 1853) was a Scottish-Canadian businessman, ship's captain and political figure in Upper Canada.

He was born in Colarich, in the parish of Logierait, Atholl, Scotland, in 1796, and emigrated to Quebec in 1800 or 1801 with his family. They moved to York (Toronto) in 1803. He served in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was captured by the Americans at York. After the war, John and his brothers piloted a number of ships on the Great Lakes. He married in 1824 and received enough property from his father-in-law to allow him to retire and devote his time to politics. 

In 1834, McIntosh was elected in the 4th riding of York as a Reformer; he was reelected in 1836. Although he supported William Lyon Mackenzie during the 1830s, he did not agree with all of Mackenzie's ideas and took no part in the Upper Canada Rebellion. McIntosh's second wife, Helen, was the sister of Mackenzie's wife. He opposed the union of Upper and Lower Canada and was defeated by Robert Baldwin in 1841 when he campaigned for reelection in 4th York. In 1849, he allowed William Lyon Mackenzie to stay at his home after Mackenzie's return from exile. He died in Toronto in 1853.

Variolites (Latin varius, "speckled, variegated") are a group of dark green basic igneous rocks that, especially on weathered surfaces, exhibit pale colored spots, or spherules, that give them a pockmarked appearance. In some conditions these spots weather out prominently; they are grey, pale green, violet or yellowish, while the matrix of the rock is usually dark green. 

The variolites are related most closely to the basalts or diabases. They are nearly always much decomposed, and, since they are also fine-grained rocks, their original composition may be much obscured by secondary changes. The variolitic spots are rounded in outline and are often about a quarter-inch in diameter, but may exceed this size. They have a radiate structure and are sometimes, though not generally, zoned with concentric circles of different appearance and composition. Many authors have compared them with the spherules of the acid rocks (obsidians and rhyolites), and undoubtedly some kinds of variolite are merely glassy spherulitic varieties of basalt. The tachylyte selvages of the dolerite dikes of the west of Scotland, for example, often contain large brown spherules that are easily visible in hand specimens. These spherulites consist of very thin divergent fibers, and their nature is often difficult to determine on account of the indefiniteness of the optical characteristics of minerals in this state. It seems probable, however, that they are mostly feldspar embedded in dark brown glass. Small phenocrysts or skeleton crystals of olivine, augite and plagioclase feldspar may occur in these tachylytes.

Other variolites are glassy or partly crystalline facies of olivine-free dolerites, occurring as thin dikes or intrusions or at the margins of dolerite masses. In these the feldspars are well crystallized as thin rods with square or forked ends radiating outwards from a center. They are commonly oligoclase, and sometimes assume branching or feathery forms. Some authors would call these sphero-crystals rather than spherules; they are an intermediate stage between the latter and the stellate groupings of feldspar that occurs frequently in igneous rocks. In the same rocks augite spherules occur also, but this mineral forms plumose growths, branching and curved, which spread through the glassy base and do not interfere with the feldspar spherules. Occasionally olivine-dolerites have a coarsely spherulic structure with long rods of plagioclase feldspar converging to a point; one example of these rocks from Skye contains variolites over three inches in diameter.

Another group of variolites includes the most famous rock of this type, which comes from the Durance, in France. Pebbles of this were well known to collectors for a long time before they were traced to their source at Mont Genvre. They were proved to belong to a diabasic rock that shows well-marked pillow-structure or spheroidal jointing. Each pillow has a marginal portion which is variolitic, but towards the center of the block-shaped masses the structure becomes coarse and groups of radiate feldspars make their appearance. It is doubtful whether the variolite is an intrusive rock or a lava flow. Many of these pillow lavas (or spilites) occur in the Devonian rocks of Germany, and they often have variolitic facies which seem to belong to the same group as the rock of the Durance. Their spherulites are very often oligoclase feldspar or decomposition products after a felspathic mineral. In other cases they consist of chlorite or pale green amphibole, both of which may be secondary after pyroxene. The ground mass is very fine grained and is filled with chlorite, epidote, leucoxene, and other secondary minerals. There is much reason to believe that it was originally in large measure vitreous, but has suffered devitrifaction. Sometimes little steam cavities occur and may serve as a nucleus from which the variolite has grown. The radiate structure of the varioles is often nearly obliterated in these much-decomposed rocks, in fact it may never have been very perfect. Variolites are found also in several parts of the Swiss Alps at Jatluga on Lake Onega, in Anglesey, the Lleyn district and Fishguard in Wales, in Cornwall, and in more than one place in Ireland.

Finally, there is a group of spotted rocks formerly known to French petrographers as the variolites du Drac from the locality in which they are found, but they have been proved to be merely vesicular, rotten diabases, with steam cavities filled with white calcite and other secondary minerals.

AMASONG is a GLAMA (Gay & Lesbian American Music Award) award-winning lesbian/feminist amateur choir based in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. The group was created by its founding director Kristina Boerger in 1990. The AMASONG choral group is a highly trained chorus of about 60 women who perform women-oriented, folkloric and classical music.  

Foundation.

In 1990, a year before beginning her master's degree in choral conducting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Boerger decided to form what she advertised as a lesbian/feminist chorus called AMASONG. The group's name was a play on the words amazon and song. Boerger said, "The word amazon conjures up images of strong women who make their own decisions. It was a way of coding our group in a certain way."

Boerger posted flyers around town about her new choral group, AMASONG. Many local women responded to the flyers. A roomful of women showed up at the first choir rehearsal, consisting mainly of lesbians, feminist housewives and students. Boerger said that the decision to label AMASONG as lesbian/feminist was important. In the PBS documentary produced by Jay Rosenstein, entitled, The AMASONG Chorus: Singing Out, Boerger explained, "There's lesbian-feminism with a hyphen, which refers to woman who are lesbian and feminist. But if you put a diagonal slash between, then it means either or. And that's very important. Whenever I tell people on the phone who we are, I make sure they get the punctuation correct. It doesn't mean you have to be both to get in the choir. It means you've got to be one or the other." The choir's first members were diverse in interest, age and experience.



Music Genre.
AMASONG's repertoire is heavily inspired by folk music from various global cultural traditions, music written by women, and other genres of music reflecting women's life experiences.

Leadership.
AMASONG records and performs regularly. It is now under the direction of choir director, Meagan Johnson Smith. 

Founding director, Kristina Boerger stepped down from her position as choir director and relocated to New York City in 2000. Boerger now conducts Cerddorion, a 28-voice volunteer chamber ensemble. She also lectures in music history at Barnard College and teaches choral conducting at the Manhattan School of Music. She tours and records with the Western Wind, which is an a cappella sextet, and the Pomerium Renaissance vocal ensemble. In addition, she is currently recording for Bobby McFerrin and collaborating on works for movement and vocal ensemble with the Christopher Caines Dancers.



Awards.
1999, GLAMA award for Best Choral Group For Shenandoah, an American folk song arranged by Kristina Boerger for a cappella chorus. Shenandoah is from AMASONG's Amai CD.  ;
1999, GLAMA award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition For Draum om Nedsnodde Bruer ("Dream of Snow-covered Bridges"), composed by Kristina Boerger and Michael Cameron for women's voices and double bass accompaniment. Draum is from AMASONG's Amai CD.

Zinkplaat is an Afrikaans band from South Africa. Its members include Bertie Coetzee, Basson Laubscher, Beitel van der Merwe and Beer Adriaanse. They are best known for  classic songs in Afrikaans such as "Alles is O.K", "Karoo Poison", "Elvis bly in Niekerkshoop" and "Piekniek oppi maan."

Early history of band members.
Bertie Coetzee (born 1984) grew up on a farm next to the Orange River in the rural farm district of the Northern Cape, South Africa. He started playing guitar and his loving mother drove him to guitar practice every Friday afternoon in a distant town, 3 hours away. His first appearance in front of people was at the Annual Prieska Gholf Day Festivities where he performed a version of Leon Schuster's "Pretty Kabousie". 

The first school he attended had 15 pupils and his grandmother was the principal. At age 7 he was sent to school and had to stay in the school's hostel, since it was a couple of hundred miles from his home. Later in life his experiences on the farm and the small towns in the district gave him the inspiration for the songs he would write with Zinkplaat.

At age 14 he was sent to Paul Roos Gymnasium in the Western Cape. In this school he was exposed to a whole array of different and interesting characters especially since children from all over South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe were sent to this school. He continued playing guitar and started living and loving the musical landscape of Stellenbosch. In the school's residence where he stayed, he met Beer (born Beer Adriaanse 1985) who was a year younger than him and came from Durbanville. He was a drummer in a punk band called My Pet Sock and a music lover of note. He also met Basson Laubscher (born 1984), a day scholar from Kuilsrivier who stayed on a small holding beteen Stellenbosch and Kuilsrivier. Basson, son of legendary South African karate master Bakkies Laubscher, had also been playing guitar since he was young and was falling around between bands and honing his skills. He was friends with the bad seeds in the school and was a truant of note.

Formation of the band.
In 2002 Bertie organized a school songwriters contest and won it himself to record two songs at the studio of J rgen von Wechmar, the legendary sound engineer who recorded many albums for artists such as The Sprinbok Nude Girls and Valiant Swart. For the recording he teamed up with Basson, who also took part in the contest, but whose fellow band member was caught by the police for alleged possession of the seed of an illegal substance, and thus couldn't take part, leaving Basson to struggle through a solo performance. The recording took part in one day and two of Bertie's own compositions was chosen, "Blikkitaar Blues" and "Jan Papier". Both had strong senses of the Karoo and the open spaces of Bertie's home district. With the sound of an acoustic guitar and a harmonica and the electric sound of Basson's guitar the short demo had a rootsy feel and a honest and rugged vibe. Randomly the name Zinkplaat was chosen for the band and the demo was sold in and around Stellenbosch for R20 and was introduced to the 17 year old Beer by a friend in the school residence. Although he was still in a punk band, the sound of this 18 year old's voice and stripped down sound impressed him greatly and he started joking with Bertie that if he ever needed a drummer for his band, he would love to help.

Throughout the rest of that year Bertie and Basson played small gigs in the Boland and started working up a repertoire. At the start of the next year they had secured a gig at the annual Wingerstok Festival and started shopping around for a band. They approached Beer who was still in school at that time and he duly said yes. By this time Bertie had also met Beitel who was attending the same university as himself. Beitel (Born Jaco van der Merwe in 1984)was a veteran bass player from Bloemfontein. He attended Grey College (the rival school of Paul Roos) and had been playing in various bands since the age of 14. He was also a part-time member of the Bloemfontein Musicon as second bass player. As he made the move to Stellenbosch he left his band, Sprincan, and with the advice of his mother left his bass guitar in Bloemfontein. As Bertie started hearing about Beitel's skills he approached him one day in the street and convinced him to come for a jam. Before this final line up was cemented however, Bertie and Basson went to the Wingerstok Festival with another drummer and bassist from The Jesse Jordan Band. On their return they had decided to try out Beitel and Beer and Bertie organized Zinkplaat's official fist practice.

Shortly thereafter they played their first gig in Tollies in Stellenbosch and although video footage of this evening shows a rusty and inexperienced group, the crowd loved it and the uniqueness of the group is evident. It also helped them in securing a few shows at the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees at the Rock Art Band Stand and it was here that Zinkplaat started capturing the public's attention. They were far younger than their contemporaries clocking in at 18 and 17 years of age, where other groups such as Gian Groen, Jesse Jordan, Akkedis, Karen Zoid and Skallabrak were well into their thirties and fourties.

Right after the KKNK Bertie borrowed some money from his father and Zinkplaat went into Sunset Studios to record their debut The Karoo Poison EP. With the backbone of the drums and the bass being added, Zinkplaat now had a much stronger and unique sound, though still sounding rough and unpolished. Easily switching from hard driving rock to calm ballads like "Grondpad" this album was an accurate sample of the new direction Afrikaans music would go in and served as hope and influence for many other young bands.

As this was a year before Fokofpolisiekar shocked the nation with their anti-christian statements and more than a year before South Africa opened their own Music Channel MK89, the scene was still rather small for Afrikaans Rock bands and it would still be a time before it would be considered "Cool" to sing Afrikaans. This was further enhanced by one of the top publications, Die Burger, starting their own Afrikaans Rock band competition for schools, called Rockspaaider. Zinkplaat seamlessly cruised through this growing phase in Afrikaans music and in important ways helped shape it.

Evendine College was a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) school located in London. It had several sites, including Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street and, in later years, Victoria.

The school was founded by Suresh Malhotra in the early 1990s and achieved notoriety in the TEFL world in 2003 when  financial problems caused the school to close in a series of events that have come to be known as "teflgate."

At its height in the late 1990s, Evendine was the largest privately-owned tefl & visa scam institution in the world, with around 20,000 students/ illegal or bogus indivduals passing through its doors. The much-copied (no one copied so successfully the philosphy of visa factory pretending to be a educational institute) Evendine ( which was never accredited by the British Council) philosophy was to attract the best teachers, senior management- (which consited of a Lord (AKA Suresh), his son, his wife and daughter (a minor -undre 18) as paid directors, and tefl innovators through a mixture of high salaries (yeah right! staff still remember) and attractive packages (staff could be shot at a whim, teachers were shot in front of their students without due proccess- some package). As such the school was at various times home to some of the biggest shots in tefl including Adam Thursby, Richard Baillie, Amanda Adorni, Nick Godfrey, Eamonn Gearon, Tony Gulvin and Geoff Maguire- most were passing through and working until they could get a better job at General Motors, Microsoft, IBM or some other Fortune 500 company.

Suresh Malhotra is currently banned from running a company for 5 years but is reportedly planning a comeback in 2008. (That would be illegal-look up barred directors on company`s house website - he, his son and wife are all banned. A voulantry ban - to avoid worse consequences. Why, the reader should wonder, was such a well run business (with such talented management as claimed) collapse- and its directors banned. In fact his lordship & family started  to belive that they were the best business brains ever. Whereas the British Department of Trade   investigations would lead to different and perhaps more rational conclusions that the business was never viable as a proper business - if it paid PAYE (taxes), produced management accounts or submitted accounts to the authorities in time and paid other company taxes - and above all taught ALL students and kept attendance records as required by the British Home Office. 

Readers are invited to check details with the authorities- most of the accounts information is in the public domain.

This modified version injects a degree of truth..but only a degree. If the writer called sureshmalhotra wants to, he can of course re-edit this. But we will continue to inject realism to this page. But maybe we will study a bit more English first before we do that.

Evening Standard article on the closure;




This page and this journal are ment to reflect a degree of reality. If that is so then this page falls short by a very long way. Many people, mainly students, lost large sums of money whilst the owner lived a lavish life style. Not legally, but by not paying taxes it seems. It now seems he is planning a come back. Ok we are waiting.

Subsumption architecture, subsumptive architecture, subsumption programming or subsumptive programming is an AI concept originating from behavior based robotics.  This term was invented by Rodney Brooks and colleagues in the mid to late 1980s.

A subsumption architecture is a way of decomposing complicated intelligent behaviour into many "simple" behaviour modules, which are in turn orgnized into layers.  Each layer implements a particular goal of the agent, and higher layers are increasingly more abstract.  Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers, e.g. the decision to move forward by the eat-food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest obstacle-avoidance layer.

For example, a robot's lowest layer could be "avoid an object", on top of it would be the layer "wander around", which in turn lies under "explore the world". The top layer in such a case could be "create a map", which is the ultimate goal. Each of these horizontal layers accesses all of the sensor data and generates actions for the actuators   the main caveat is that separate tasks can inhibit inputs or overrule outputs. This way, the lowest layers can work like fast-adapting mechanisms (reflexes), while the higher layers control the main direction to be taken in order to achieve the overall goal. Feedback is given mainly through the environment.

Two main disadvantages of this model are the inability to have many layers since the goals begin interfering with each other and the rather low flexibility at runtime.

The first publication mentioning the subsumption architecture is Brooks (1986) --- as of October 2006, Google Scholar shows 3500 citations of that paper.

Key papers include:

 R. A. Brooks (1986) "A Robust Layered Control System For A Mobile Robot", IEEE Journal Of Robotics And Automation, RA-2, April. pp. 14-23.
 R. A. Brooks (1987). "Planning is just a way of avoiding figuring out what to do next", Technical report, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
 R. Brooks and A. Flynn (1989), "Fast, cheap, and out of control: A robot invasion of the solar system," J. Brit. Interplanetary Soc., vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 478-485, 1989. (The paper later gave rise to the title of the film Fast, Cheap and Out of Control, and the paper's concepts arguably have been seen in practice in the 2003/4 Mars Exploration Rover Mission.);

The California Space Authority (CSA) is a nonprofit corporation representing the commercial, civil, and national defense/homeland security interests of California's diverse space enterprise community in four domains: Industry, Government, Academia, and Workforce.  CSA is also a participating member in the Coalition for Space Exploration.

 Overview .

Former schoolteacher, Assemblywoman and Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand currently serves as the Executive Director of CSA, which is governed by a statewide board of directors, composed of twelve members elected by the CSA Membership.  Four directors are selected from each of CSA's three regions (Northern, Central, and Southern California) during elections that are held in the Fall in which each director is elected to a 3-year term.  The terms of office are staggered such that half of the seats on theí board are up for election each year.  The Board may fill additional 1-year seats with CSA members to ensure adequate representation is met across CSA's constituent types (industry, government, academia, large, small, etc.).

Designated as California's Spaceport Authority, CSA is tasked by the state of California to operate as a member-based "enterprise" association that works closely with individual, corporate, state and local government and academic stakeholders throughout the state.  The main purpose of CSA is to facilitate California's competitiveness within the aerospace industry.  In this capacity, CSA is also authorized to facilitate development of California-based spaceports. 

Comprised of space-related companies, individual entrepreneurs, government agencies, non-profit organizations and College and University research programs, California's space enterprise provides or supports the delivery of hundreds of space-related products and services to the state and the nation.  The total economic impact of California's space enterprise (Commercial, Civil, National Security) is estimated to be in excess of $120 billion dollars.  Representing 24% of the global space market, California space enterprise impacts over 251,000 jobs statewide.

Some of the major responsibilities of the CSA are to:

 Serve as the official voice of the State of California on space technology issues to the federal government, other state governments, local governments and the private sector; ;
 Act as the official policy advisor to the Governor and State Legislature on space-related matters; ;
 Link statewide resources and capital to California space and technology enterprises; ;
 Promote California as an international center of space technology; ;
 Coordinate the development of the California Strategic Space Plan, and; ;
 Design and administer a competitive grant program.


 History .

The predecessor organization to the California Space Authority (CSA) was the California Space and Technology Alliance (CSTA).  The first CSA Board of Directors was seated in January of 2001.

The California Space and Technology Alliance was established in 1996 as a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization to foster development of space industry and was officially recognized by the state when Governor Pete Wilson signed Assembly Bill 1475 into law in October of 1997.  AB 1475, co-sponsored by state Senator John Vasconcellos and Assemblymembers Jim Cunneen, Elaine K. Alquist and Liz Figueroa created the CSTA "to foster the development of specified activities in California related to space flight." The vision of the CSTA was that "California leads the world in space education, research, technology, manufacturing, services and transportation."  

The bill also authorized the CSTA to function as the California Spaceport Authority (one of five spaceport authorities in the nation) and set forth the duties of the CSTA.  One such duty was to administer the Space Flight Competitive Grant Program.

Prior to enactment of AB 1475, California, which had been a leader in the space industry, did not have a coordinated, statewide voice on space issues.  By creating the CSTA, AB 1475 provided a vehicle for such a unified voice.  The CSTA served as the official policy advisor to the Governor and the Legislature on space-related matters, while acting as an advocate for the state on space technology issues (CA Government Code 15333.3).

 CSA's strategic purpose .

To retain, grow and create California space enterprise. 


 CSA's mission .

To provide California space enterprise voice, visibility, and a competitive edge.

Rosemary Annette Kyburz (born 16 April, 1944) Member of the Queensland State Parliament (1974-1983) as the Liberal Member for Salisbury.

Kyburz married fellow politician Rob Akers while in parliament, the first time sitting members had married each other. Another first was giving birth to her first son while a parliamentarian.

Kyburz was a well known supporter of feminist causes in 1970s Queensland politics. She and her husband both lost their seats in the 1983 Liberal Party electoral collapse after National Party Premier (Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen) characterised many of the Liberal Party members of his Coalition government as "ratbags".  She later stated that she would prefer to lose her seat to a Labor Party candidate than a National: she received her wish, being defeated in 1983, shortly after giving birth, by Wayne Goss.

Kyburz was born Rosemary Annette Plim in Sydney, Australia, daughter of John Bruce and Zoe Rose Plim. She married her first husband, Rolf Kyburz in Argentina.

He was made partner in the firm in 1961 and later became Managing Director. Rohatyn became widely known in the 1970s for successfully restructuring New York City's debt and resolving the city's fiscal crisis.

In 1990, he received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York."

On August 22, 2006, he was appointed by Lehman Brothers as a chairman of the international advisory committee and as a senior adviser to its chairman, Richard S. Fuld, Jr.

Diplomacy and foreign policy credentials.
Rohatyn served as United States Ambassador to France from 1997 to 2000 during the second Clinton Administration and is a Commander in the French Legion of Honor. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="593524" title="Agder" nonfiltered="532" processed="528" dbindex="450536">
For the small town in Minnesota, see Agder Township, Minnesota.;

Agder is a historical district of Norway in the southernmost region of Norway, corresponding to the two counties (fylker) Vest-Agder and Aust-Agder. Today, the term Sørlandet ("south country") is more commonly used.

The name of Agder.
The name Agder is older than the Norwegian language. Its meaning is not known. Just as Norwegian derives from Old Norse, Agder derives from the Old Norse word Agðir.  In the early Viking Age, before Harald Fairhair, Agðir was a petty kingdom inhabited by a people named after it, the Egðir.

Nothing in Old Norse, however, gives any hint as to the meaning of the word; i.e., it was not produced (from known segments) in Old Norse, which means that the name is older still. The Egðir are believed to be the same etymologically as the Augandzi people mentioned in the Getica of Jordanes, who wrote of Scandza (Scandinavia) in the 6th century. If Jordanes' Scandza is a palatalized form of *Scandia, then Augandzi is likely to be a palatalized form of *Augandii, residents of *Augandia.

A name of that period would have to be closer to Proto-Germanic; in fact, a word of that period does present itself and fits the geographical lore of the times: *agwjo, "island", which Jordanes and all his predecessors writing of Scandinavia believed it to be. A simple metathesis produces a possibly late form, *augjo-; however, this derivation is speculative. There is no other evidence on Auganza and its connection to Egder also is hypothetical.
History.
Norway of the Viking Age was divided into petty kingdoms ruled by chiefs who contended for land, maritime supremacy or political ascendance and sought alliances or control through marriage with other royal families, either voluntary or forced. These circumstances produced the generally turbulent and heroic lives recorded in the Heimskringla. 

For example, the Ynglinga saga tells us that Harald Redbeard, chief of Agðir, refused his daughter Åsa to Gudröd Halvdanson, on which event Gudröd invaded Agðir, killed Harald and his son Gyrd, and took Åsa whether she would or no. She bore a son, Halvdan (the Black), obviously named after his deceased grandfather, and later arranged to have Gudröd assassinated. Among the royal families these events seem to have been rather ordinary. Her word was the last in the argument, as her grandson, Harald Fairhair, unified Norway.

Kings of Agder:
 Kissa;
 Harald, father of Åsa, mother of Halfdan the Black;
 Halfdan the Black, father of Harald Fairhair, from 838.
 Kjotve the Rich, late 800s;
 Harald Gudrødsson Grenske, 976-987;

Prior to the Viking Age is a gap in the history of the region for a few hundred years, but in Jordanes we also find regions of the same but earlier forms of names, presumably also petty kingdoms under now unknown chiefs. The previous most credible source, Ptolemy, gives the briefest of sketches, only citing all of Norway as the Chaedini ("country people"). Perhaps the difference between kingdoms were not sufficiently important to cite them individually.

Prior to then the most credible and respected source, Tacitus in Germania Chapter 44 described the Suiones, who were divided into civitates (kingdoms?) along the coast of Scandinavia and were unusual in owning fleets of a special type of ship. These were pointed on both ends and were driven by banks of oars that could be rearranged or shipped for river passage (What rivers? Fjords, perhaps.). They did not depend on sail (so Tacitus says) but other than that they do not differ from Viking ships. These civitates went all the way around Scandinavia to the arctic, or at least to regions of very long days, where they stopped.

It seems clear that in the Roman Iron Age Norway was populated by people of the same identity as Sweden, who were called the Suiones by Latin sources. In settling the coast at some point in prehistory they had been divided into civitates by the terrain. These states took on mainly geographical names or names of individuals or mythological characters. Agder was one of them.

After the unification of Norway by Harold Fairhair and army and allies in the 10th century, all the civitates became provinces (fylker) and after their conversion to Christianity dioceses or parishes. The development of Old Norse into local dialects and the dissimilation of customs due to isolation added an ethnic flavor to the fylker, which is cherished today.

The Cog Factory was Omaha, Nebraska's legendary main punk rock venue that opened it's doors one night in 1994 with bands Killdozer and Ritual Device.  Bands such as Slowdown Virginia used to play at the venue. It closed for good in January 2002.  Serving as the foothold for the Omaha punk rock, hardcore, ska, and indie scene for many years, the cog factory was an easily accessible all ages venue.  Located in downtown Omaha, Nebraska near the historic Old Market, the cog factory served as the launching pad for the careers of many Saddle Creek Records bands, as well as being a tour stop for national acts.  Cog Factory also promoted shows at Sokol Auditorium when the draw was too large for it's own club: Fugazi, John Spencer Blues Explosion, Jesus Lizard, Coal Chamber, man or astro man,...

The Cog Factory was a non-profit 501(c)3 organization run strictly by volunteers. All the proceeds from shows were used to cover the building expenses and payment of artists.  Robb Rathe, Scott Ruehle, Dan Brennan, Matt Baum, Ross Manhart, Chris Harding and many other local friends and volunteers operated cog factory until November 1998 when Robb moved to portland, oregon.  Chris Harding and Thad Teppley took over for approximately the next year and a half.  Numerous other volunteers tried keeping the club going until 2002, when cog factory finally disbanded.  Although tax penalties were paid by cog factory to the IRS in 2002, this was not the reason for the club's closing.  With all the original founding volunteers no longer operating cog factory after 2001, it's original goal of providing an all-ages venue for every type of independent music free of discrimination started to erode.  The club's organizational structure broke down, sufficient funds were no longer being earned, and the location was evacuated.

Footage of the venue is shown in the Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek documentary.

Ray Joseph Cormier is a courrier in the Ottawa-Gatineau area, currently living in Gatineau, Quebec. He has twice ran for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons as an independent, and once ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Cormier claims to have played a "major minor role" in the formation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He recalls being arrested on a number of occaisons in the late 1970s for making speeches in Downtown Ottawa and making a scene. Cormier worked outside of parliament, and claims to have slipped then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau a note recalling the incident. Cormier believes this may have influenced the Charter of Rights and Freedoms Trudeau helped to patriate.

Cromier ran in the Canadian federal election, 1984 under the slogan of  "God, country, peace, love, freedom and the legalization of marijuana". He received 71 votes as an independent in Ottawa Centre.
That same year, he ran as an independent in a by-election in Ottawa Centre where he received 94 votes.  Cormier ran again in Ottawa Centre as an independent in the Canadian federal election, 1997. This time Cormier ran to fight government corruption, and wanted a minority government and the need for change. He received 91 votes.

History.
The Atlantic port city of Limbe, formerly known as Victoria, was founded by British missionary Alfred Saker. The city lies on the southwest coast of the Republic of Cameroon between West and Central Africa. Colonized by Germany in 1884, then divided into French and British zones after World War I, Cameroon became a republic in 1972.

Language.
The Southwest Province's official language is English, although French is often spoken due to the city's geographic proximity to Douala, where the official language is French. Most of the population speaks Cameroonian Pidgin English. The native language of the region is Bakweri or Mokpwe.

Of interest.
Limbe is located on a beautiful bay against the backdrop of a major mountain range. Gorgeous black sand beaches make Limbe one of two coastal towns (Kribi being the other) that are popular among Western tourists.  The Limbe Wildlife Centre and Limbe Botanical Gardens are notable attractions.

Commerce.
Cameroon is world famous for its tea and agriculture production, and Limbe is the center of its oil industry.  The Port of Limbe is one of four commercial ports in Cameroon.

This article is about the city planner.  For the Metal Gear character, see List of classic Metal Gear characters;
George E. Kessler (1862   1923) was a German American pioneer city planner and landscape architect.

George Kessler was born in Frankenhausen, Germany in 1862.  In 1865, his widowed mother, who taught French and art to support the two, took her son to Dallas, Texas in the United States.  Later, George worked as a cashboy at Sanger Harris Dry Goods .

Kessler moved to Europe and studied civic design in Germany, France, and Russia.  In 1882 he moved to Kansas City and designed a railroad-owned amusement park.  In 1893 he drew up the plans for the city's park-boulevard system .  In 1904, he designed and landscaped the grounds at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.

The same year he also designed Fair Park in Dallas, but his biggest gift to that city was his "Kessler Plan", which he created in 1909.  That year the Dallas Chamber of Commerce established the City Plan and Improvement League and hired Kessler to design a long-range plan of civic improvements for Dallas.  His plans included fixing the uncontrollable flooding of the Trinity River, fixing narrow, crooked downtown streets, and fixing dangerous railroad crossings.  At that time his plans were not implemented and were deemed "impractical," but later it became very clear that changes were needed.

In 1918 Kessler returned to act as consulting engineer for the Dallas Property Owner's Association and in 1919 began working for the Metropolitan Development Association of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce.  On 3 January 1922, he returned to St. Louis.  His plans for the Trinity River were finally implemented in the 1930s.

Kessler also drafted city plans for Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Cleveland, El Paso, Denver, and Syracuse.  He also designed Camp Wilson, an army cantonment near San Antonio .

He died in Indianapolis, survived by his wife and son.  In Indianapolis, a major street, Kessler Boulevard, is named for him.

Philostorgius (368-439) was a scholar of Late Antiquity who subscribed to Arianism, a theory that questioned the Trinitarian account of the relationship between God the Father and Christ and was considered a heresy by early Christians.  Very little information about his life is available; he was born in Borissus, Cappadocia and later lived in Constantinople.  He wrote a history of the Arian schism titled History of the Church.  The work is lost, but an epitome of it by Photius survives.

It's Happy Bunny is the name of a character in a series of stickers, buttons, posters, and other merchandise sold at novelty shops across North America. Designed by artist and writer Jim Benton, It's Happy Bunny is a small, smiling bunny, often varying in color, with a slogan printed at its feet. 

The appeal of the merchandise lies in the fact that most, if not all, of the slogans are apathetic and sometimes offensive and derogatory. Examples are "You suck and that's sad" and "It worries me how cool you are" . The first Happy Bunny slogan was "You are smart."

Happy Bunny products are sold in many forms such as stickers, backgrounds, desktops, jewelry, merchandise, computer mousepads. Some quotes include: 
"Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it"
"Cute but kind of Strange"
and many others.

It's Happy Bunny has a line of "medicine" to cure to most awkward of diseases such as the "I'm  delusional" pills., however, are simply mints or small candies that are more for display for adults or kids.  
This merchandise is found in many shops, such as Claire's, Mervyns, and Kohls.

In addition, Jim Benton has written three It's Happy Bunny Books: Love Bites , What's Your Sign?, and The Good, The Bad, and the Bunny. These books are targeted towards teen audiences and should not be mistaken for children's books. In addition, an It's Happy Bunny Sudoku book has been written by Jim Benton and Rafael Sirkis.  This book is not as derogatory as the others.

<doc id="3576703" title="Mandibular second molar" nonfiltered="547" processed="543" dbindex="450552">


The mandibular second molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face) from both the mandibular first molars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular third molars.  This is true only in permanent teeth.  In deciduous (baby) teeth, the mandibular second molar is the last tooth in the mouth and does not have a third molar behind it.  The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principle action during mastication, commonly known as chewing.  Though there is more variation between individuals to that of the first mandibular molar, there are usually four cusps on mandibular second molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek) and two palatal (side nearest the palate).  There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar.  It is important to note that the permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it.  Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars.

In the universal system of notation, the deciduous mandibular second molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular second molar is known as "T", and the left one is known as "K". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular second molar is known as "85", and the left one is known as "75".

In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular second molars are designated by a number.  The right permanent mandibular second molar is known as "31", and the left one is known as "18".  In the Palmer notation, a number is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found.  For this tooth, the left and right second molars would have the same number, "7", but the right one would have the symbol, " ", underneath it, while the left one would have, " ".  The international notation has a different numbering system from the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular second molar is known as "47", and the left one is known as "37".

Segments.

Shooting.

The shooting phase began at 10 a.m.  Each pentathlete fired 20 shots, with no more than 40 seconds between shots.  The perfect score for each shot was 10 points, for a total possible of 200.  Pentathlon points (MP points) were accorded assuming a par score of 172 points, meaning that a pentathlete scored 1000 MP points for that score.  Each shooting point above or below the par resulted in an addition or subtraction of 12 MP points.  Therefore, if a shooter hit the perfect 200, he would receive 1336 MP points.



Fencing.

Fencing began at 11 a.m.  The format used was one-touch epee fencing, with each pentathlete facing every competitor once.  Since there were 32 pentathletes, each competed in 31 bouts.  Fencing in modern pentathlon awards 1000 MP points for pentathletes who win 70% of their bouts; in this case, 22 wins and 9 losses.  Each win above that added 28 MP points while each loss above 9 subtracted 28.



Swimming.

Swimming events began at 2:25 p.m.  The pentathletes were divided into four heats of eight athletes each.  MP points were awarded based on a par time of 2:30.00 for a 200 metre freestyle time trial.  Every one-third of a second below that added 4 points to the base 1000.  Swimming was the highest-scoring event of the five, with no athletes scoring fewer than 1100 points.



Riding.

Riding was the fourth segment held, beginning shortly after 4 p.m.  Each competitor was randomly paired with one of the 16 horses used for the competition, with each horse performing twice.  The course included 15 jumps as well as a time limit.  Completing the course inside the time limit without knocking any of the bars off of the jumps would have resulted in 1200 MP points, with points subtracted for going over time, colliding with obstacles, or other equestrian faults.  The penalties assessed were taken directly from the 1200 point starting total.



Running.

The 3 kilometre cross-country race was the final segment of the modern pentathlon.  It used a staggered-start, with the points leader (Andrey Moiseev) after the first four events going first.  The rest of the competitors had to wait 1 second for each 4 points they were behind Moiseev.  Since the scoring for the race used a par time of 10:00.00 with each second above or below that time subtracting or adding 4 points to the base 1000, the staggered start meant that the finishing order of the race was the actual final standing of the entire event.  

Moiseev's head start gave him a fairly easy victory, 13 seconds before the next best pentathlete, even though 10 competitors ran the course in faster times.  Andrejus Zadneprovskis ran the 3 kilometres in 20 fewer seconds than Moiseev, but since Zadneprovskis started 33 seconds after the Russian had, he was unable to catch Moiseev.

Caldwell County is a county located in the state of North Carolina, USA.  As of 2000, the population was 77,415.  Its county seat is Lenoir6.

 History .
The county was formed in 1841 from parts of Burke County and Wilkes County.  It was named for Joseph Caldwell, presiding professor (1796-1797, 1799-1804) and the first president (1804-1812, 1816-1835) of the University of North Carolina. 

A series of reductions in the county's territory followed.  In 1847 parts of Caldwell County, Iredell County, and Wilkes County were combined to form Alexander County.  In 1849 parts of Caldwell County, Ashe County, Wilkes County, and Yancey County were combined to form Watauga County.  In 1861, parts of Caldwell County, Burke County, McDowell County, Watauga County, and Yancey County were combined to form Mitchell County.  Finally, in 1911 parts of Caldwell County, Mitchell County, and Watauga County were combined to form Avery County.

 Law and government .
The county is governed by a five-member Board of Commissioners, who appoint a County Manager. 

Caldwell County is a member of the regional Western Piedmont Council of Governments.

Geography.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,228 km² (474 mi²).  1,221 km² (472 mi²) of it is land and 7 km² (3 mi²) of it (0.57%) is water. Caldwell County is divided into three distinct geographic sections: the Blue Ridge Mountains, which dominate the northern and western parts of the county; the gently rolling Piedmont country in the middle and southern parts of the county; and the Brushy Mountains, an isolated remnant of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The "Brushies", as they are often called, run across much of Caldwell County's eastern section. Hibriten Mountain, located within the city limits of Lenoir, the county's largest city, marks the western end of the Brushy Mountain range.

The Palestinian territories is one of a number of designations for those portions of the British Mandate of Palestine captured and militarily occupied by Egypt and Jordan, and later, in the Six-Day War, by Israel. 

The designation refers to the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, but does not include the Golan Heights or the Sinai Peninsula, which were also captured by Israel in 1967, although the Sinai Peninsula was later returned to Egypt. 

Name.
Other terms used to describe these areas together are "occupied Palestinian territories", "Israeli-occupied territories", though all of these are, in context, simply referred to as "the occupied territories."
More terms include "disputed territories", "Judea and Samaria, and Gaza", "Yesha", "liberated territories", "1967 territories", and simply "the territories". 

The United Nations generally uses the term "Occupied Palestinian Territory," with the "Palestinian" label having gained use since the 1970s. Previous UNSC resolutions (such as 242 and 338) use the term "Territories occupied by Israel", whereas in the UN General Assembly Resolution 181 passed on November 29, 1947, the term "Samaria and Judea" was used. Many Jews object to the term "Palestinian territories", which they perceive as a rejection of what is in their view legitimate Jewish land according to what the believe to be God's word in the Hebrew Bible. Likewise, some Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims object to the term "Israel", which they perceive as a rejection of what is in their view legitimate Palestinian land.

Political status.
The political status of these territories has been the subject of negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and of numerous statements and resolutions by the United Nations. See List of the UN resolutions concerning Israel for further details.

The current and future political status of the territories is highly controversial. Specific issues include the legality of Israeli's policy of encouraging settlement, whether it is legitimate for Israel to annex portions of the territories, whether Israel is legally an occupying power according to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and whether an independent Arab state will be created in the territories (see Proposals for a Palestinian state).

Since 1994, the autonomous Palestinian Authority has exercised various degrees of control in large parts of the territories, pursuant to the Oslo Accords.

The Israeli government's position remains to be defined, following that country's 2006 legislative elections, but it appears that the new government will pursue a policy of partial withdrawal (if necessary, unilaterally) from the West Bank, an initiative known as the Realignment plan, while aiming to retain all of East Jerusalem and some other areas, including major West Bank settlement blocks.

Boundaries.
The boundaries between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the State of Israel, known as the Green Line, are a result of the 1949 Armistice Agreements after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, while their boundaries with Jordan and Egypt follow the international border between the former Mandate for Palestine and those states. The natural geographic boundaries for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, respectively.

Between 1949 and 1967, these territories were occupied by Jordan and Egypt respectively, but the term "Palestinian territories" or "Occupied Palestinian Territories" gained wide usage after Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, about the same time as the term "Palestinian" first started to be used exclusively in respect to Arab population of Palestine. Since then, the United Nations and most foreign governments regard the territories as being under Israeli military occupation.

Since 1994, the autonomous Palestinian Authority has exercised various degrees of control in large parts of the territories, pursuant to the Oslo Accords.

The term "Palestinian territories" .
Generally, the term "Palestinian territories" is used by:
journalists to indicate lands where Palestinian people dwell, outside the Green Line, or the 1949 Armistice lines;
some Arab nationalists, who consider the land within Israel's de facto boundaries to be de jure part of a "Palestinian state."  Some advocates have claimed that maps used in schools under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority depict this state as consisting of all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea, Lebanon, Syria, the Jordan River and Egypt   including Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ;

The term is often used interchangeably with the term Occupied territories, although the latter refers to an inclusive set of both the "Palestinian territories" and the Golan Heights. The Golan is not settled by Palestinians nor claimed by them, but rather by Syria, though the tiny Shebaa Farms area is also claimed by Lebanon. The confusion stems from the fact that all these territories were captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and are regarded by the United Nations as being under military occupation.

Some, especially in the Right-wing sectors of Israeli society, assert that the term "occupied Palestinian lands" is "the common language of Arab anti-Israel propaganda, a part of the Arabs' fictional history, which it has succeeded in disseminating throughout the whole wide world". "Impartial groups should not be blind to the fact that there are two sides to the dispute in Palestine, and that Israel rejects absolutely the notion that it is illegally holding 'Palestinian lands'." 

 History .

In 1922 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire that ruled the region of Palestine for four centuries (1517-1917), the Mandate for Palestine was established. Large-scale Jewish immigration from abroad, mainly from Eastern Europe took place during the British Mandate. The future of Palestine was hotly disputed between Arabs and Jews. In 1947, the total Jewish ownership of land in Palestine was 1,850,000 dunums or 1,850 square kilometers, which is 7.04% of the total land of Palestine. Public property or "crown lands", the bulk of which was in the Negev, belonging to the government of Palestine may have made up as much as 70% of the total land; with the Arabs, Christians and others owning the rest. 

The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan proposed a division of the mandated territory between an Arab and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem and the surrounding area to be a corpus separatum under a special international regime. The regions allotted to the proposed Arab state included what would become the Gaza Strip and almost all of what would become the West Bank, as well as other areas.

Jewish groups (notably the Jewish Agency) generally supported the partition plan. Arab groups (all Arab countries in the U.N. voted against it) generally rejected the partition plan and subsequently invaded the newly formed State of Israel, starting the Israeli War of Independence.

After the war, Israel controlled many of the areas designated for the Arab state, and the negotiated agreements established Armistice Demarcation Lines (ADLs), which did not have the status of recognised international borders.

Thus the areas held by Jordanian and Iraqi forces (with minor adjustments) came under Jordanian control, and became known as the West Bank (of the Jordan River, by contrast with the East Bank, or Jordan proper); the area held by Egyptian forces, along the Mediterranean coast in the vicinity of the city of Gaza and south to the international border, remained under Egyptian control and became known as the Gaza Strip.

For nineteen years following the 1949 Armistice Agreements until the 1967 Six Day War, Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip and Jordan occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and no Arab state was created. In 1950, Jordan annexed the territories it occupied; this annexation was not officially recognized by other countries, with the sole exception of the United Kingdom (but not, as is often said, Pakistan).

The Article 24 of the Palestinian National Charter of 1964  stated: "This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area."

Israel captured both territories in the 1967 Six-Day War; since then they have been under Israeli control. After the war, UN Security Council Resolution 242 introduced the "Land for Peace" formula for normalizing relations between Israel and its neighbors.

The Oslo Accords of the early 1990's between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority. This was an interim organization created to administer a limited form of Palestinian self-governance in the territories for a period of five years during which final-status negotiations would take place. The Palestinian Authority carried civil responsibility in some rural areas, as well as security responsibility in the major cities of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Although the five-year interim period expired in 1999, the final status agreement has yet to be concluded despite attempts such as the 2000 Camp David Summit, the Taba summit, and the unofficial Geneva Accords.

In 2005, Israeli forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip, ceding full effective internal control of the territory to the Palestinian Authority.

 Legal status.
See related articles: International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict, Political status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Status of territories captured by Israel.;

The final status of the "Palestinian territories" as becoming (wholly or largely) an independent state for Arabs is supported by the countries that back the Quartet's "Road map for peace". The government of Israel also accepted the road map but with 14 reservations .

Although Israeli settlements were not part of the Oslo Accords negotiations, the Arab position is that the creation and the presence of Israeli settlements in those areas is a violation of international law. This has also been affirmed by a majority of members of the Geneva convention: "12. The participating High Contracting Parties call upon the Occupying Power to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention. They reaffirm the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof. They recall the need to safeguard and guarantee the rights and access of all inhabitants to the Holy Places." 

East Jerusalem, captured in 1967, was unilaterally annexed by Israel. The UN Security Council Resolution 478 condemned the Jerusalem Law as "a violation of international law". This annexation has not been recognized by other nations, although the United States Congress has declared its intention to recognize the annexation (a proposal that has been condemned by other states and organizations). Because of the question of Jerusalem's status, some states refuse to accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and treat Tel Aviv as the capital, basing their diplomatic missions there. Israel asserts that these territories are not currently claimed by any other state, and that Israel has the right to control them.

Israel's position has not been officially accepted by most countries and international bodies. The West Bank, and the Gaza Strip have been referred to as occupied territories (with Israel as the occupying power) by Palestinian Arabs , the rest of the Arab bloc, the UK , the EU, (usually) the USA (, ), both the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations , the International Court of Justice, and the Israeli Supreme Court (see Israeli West Bank barrier). The United Nations did not declare any change in the status of the territories as of the creation of the Palestinian National Authority between 1993 and 2000. Although a 1999 U.N. document (see the link above) implied that the chance for a change in that status was slim at that period, most observers agreed that the Palestinian territories' classification as occupied was losing substantiality, and would be withdrawn after the signing of a permanent peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians (see also Proposals for a Palestinian state).

During the period between the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada beginning in 2000, Israeli officials claimed that the term "occupation" did not accurately reflect the state of affairs in the territories. During this time, the Palestinian population in large parts of the territories had a large degree of autonomy and only limited exposure to the IDF except when seeking to move between different areas. Following the events of the Second Intifada, and in particular, Operation Defensive Shield, most territories, including Palestinian cities (Area A), are back under effective Israeli military control, so the discussion along those lines is largely moot.

In the summer of 2005, Israel implemented its unilateral disengagement plan; about 8500 Israeli citizens living in the Gaza Strip were forcibly removed from the territory; some received alternative homes and a sum of money. The Israeli Defence Forces vacated Gaza in 2005, but invaded it again in 2006 in response to rocket attacks and the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas.

The Palestinian territories have been assigned a country code of PS in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, and accordingly, the Palestinian Authority was granted control of the corresponding Internet country code top-level domain .ps.

 United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 .
United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242), one of the most commonly referenced UN resolutions in Middle Eastern politics, was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on November 22, 1967 in the aftermath of the Six Day War. It was adopted under Chapter VI 
of the United Nations Charter , and was reaffirmed by UN Security Council Resolution 338, adopted after the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

The resolution calls for the "withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict" (there has been some disagreement about whether this means all the territories: see UN Security Council Resolution 242: semantic dispute) and the "ermination of all claims or states of belligerency". It also calls for the mutual recognition by the belligerent parties (Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan) of each other's established states and calls for the establishment of secure and recognized boundaries for all parties.

Barrington Moore Jr. (12 May 1913 - 16 October 2005) was an American political sociologist, whose works include 1966's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World. In that work he studied the conditions for the sociogenesis of democratic, fascist and communist regimes, looking especially at the ways in which industrialization and the pre-existing agrarian regimes interacted to produce those different political outcomes.  He drew particular attention to the violence which preceded the development of democratic institutions.

Moore's groundbreaking work, Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (1966), was the cornerstone to what is now called comparative-historical analysis in the social sciences. Moore's concern was the transformation of pre-industrial agrarian social relations into "modern" ones. He highlighted what he called "three routes to the modern world" -- the liberal democratic, the fascist, and the communist -- each deriving from the timing of industrialization and the social structure at the time of transition.

In the simplest sense, Social Origins can be summarized with his famous statement on page 418 "No bourgeoisie, no democracy," though taking that idea at face value undercuts and misinterprets the nuances of his argument. In England, the effect of the "bourgeois impulse" was to change the attitudes of a portion of the landed elite towards commercial farming, leading to the destruction of the peasantry through the enclosure system and the English Civil War which led to an aristocratic, but moderate democracy. In France, the French Revolution did directly include the bourgeoisie, but it was the overwhelming influence of the peasantry that determined "just how far the revolution could go." The peasantry remained thereafter a reservoir of reactionary attitudes. In the United States, the industrial north's victory over the Southern planter elite in the Civil War cemented the U.S. path to modernity through liberal democracy, but only after southern planters "acquired a tincture" of urban business -- essentially changing their attitudes towards capitalist accumulation. The result, however, was that once this transformation took place, the Northern capitalists ended Reconstruction and allowed the South to instigate Jim Crow.

Moore also directly addressed the Japanese transition to modernity through fascism and the communist path in China, while implicitly remarking on Germany and Russia. For Moore, the influence of the bourgeoisie in Japan was significantly more limited than in England, France, and the U.S. Instead of the capitalist accumulation through the "bourgeois impulse" as it did in those three cases, Japan's late transition to industrial modernity was induced through "labor repressive" agriculture -- squeezing the peasantry to generate the necessary capital for modernization. This "revolution from above" served to cement a reactionary alliance of a weak bourgeoisie and powerful landowners that culiminated in fascism. In China, the overwhelming strength of the peasantry vis-a-vis the bourgeoisie and the landed elites resulted in the Chinese Revolution, but ironically they were its first victims.  Here, the bourgeoisie allied with the peasants, and created a "revolution from below."  One can see Moore's theme of the bourgeoisie again here - in the states that became democratic, there was a strong bourgeoisie.  In Japan and China, the bourgeoisie was weak, and allied with the elites or peasants to create fascism or communism, respectively.

After graduating from Williams College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, he took his Ph.D. in sociology from Yale University in 1941.  Moore then worked as a policy analyst for the OSS during World War II, under Herbert Marcuse. In the 1950s he was based at Harvard's Russian research center, where he wrote books about the Soviet Union. In 1958 he published a book of essays on methodology and theory entitled Political Power and Social Theory, in which he attacked the methodological outlook of 1950s social science. While at Harvard, his students included comparative social scientists Theda Skocpol, and Charles Tilly.

Other works include, Reflections on the Causes of Human Misery (1972) and  (1978).

Thomas Patrick Barrasso (born March 31, 1965 in Boston, Massachusetts) is a former National Hockey League  goaltender who played 18 seasons for the Buffalo Sabres, Pittsburgh Penguins, Ottawa Senators, Carolina Hurricanes, Toronto Maple Leafs and St. Louis Blues.

Playing career.
Tom Barrasso grew up in the town of Stow, Massachusetts, playing ice hockey on an outdoor rink. He started playing goalie when he was only 4 years old and by the time he was a teenager, playing in net for Acton-Boxborough high school, Barrasso was considered one of the most promising American goaltending prospects of all time. He was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres with the 5th overall pick in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft, becoming the highest drafted goalie ever until Roberto Luongo was taken 4th overall in 1997. Skipping a college career, he went straight from high school to the NHL where he exceeded all expectations. Barrasso won the Calder Trophy and Vezina Trophy in his first season, becoming just the third player to win both awards in the same year. Nicknamed "Tomcat", he next made his debut for Team USA at the 1984 Canada Cup at only 19 years of age. He also played at the 1986 Ice Hockey World Championship and the 1987 Canada Cup.

In 1988, the Sabres traded Barrasso to the Pittsburgh Penguins where he won two Stanley Cups, in 1991 and 1992. It was his outstanding play in these Cup runs that established him as a "money goalie", someone who could deliver wins when it counted the most. In the following years, Barrasso almost entirely missed two seasons, the 1994-95 NHL season and the 1996-97 NHL season with injuries but came back with good performances in the next years. In 1997 he became the first American goaltender to record 300 NHL wins. A fiercely proud competitor, in his later seasons in Pittsburgh he developed a strained relationship with the local media whom he felt were disrespectful of him and his family. He eventually refused to speak with the media at all which tarnished his public image in Pittsburgh. 

In March 2000, he was traded to the Ottawa Senators. A notable incident that happened was after the Senators were defeated in Game 7 against the Toronto Maple Leafs, He told a Hockey Night in Canada reporter "I don't give a shit about what all of you think!!". After making that statement, he spent the 2000-01 season out of hockey and returned with the Carolina Hurricanes in time for the 2001-02 season. Due to nagging injuries, Barrasso never regained his old status as an NHL star. He did however enjoy some late international success, winning Silver at the 2002 Winter Olympics. 

In his last few seasons he briefly played for several teams, the Ottawa Senators, the Carolina Hurricanes, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the St. Louis Blues until retiring from ice hockey in 2003. He signed a pro forma contract with Pittsburgh on the day he declared retirement so he could leave hockey as a Penguin.

<doc id="136178" title="Borger, Texas" nonfiltered="560" processed="556" dbindex="450565">
Borger is a city in Hutchinson County, Texas, United States. The population was 14,302 at the 2000 census.

 History .
The city of Borger is named after its founder, A. P. (Ace) Borger, who had a reputation throughout Oklahoma and Texas as a shrewd town promoter. Borger and his business partner John R. Miller purchased a 240-acre townsite near the Canadian River in March 1926 after the discovery of oil in the vicinity. Within a few months time, the boomtown had swelled to a population of 45,000, most lured by sensationalist advertising and "black gold". In October 1926, the city charter was adopted and Miller was elected mayor. By this time the Panhandle & Santa Fe Railway had completed the spur line to Borger, a post office had opened, and a school district was established. The boomtown of Borger soon had steam-generated electricity, telephone service, a hotel and jail.

In the months that followed, oilmen, roughnecks, prospectors, panhandlers and fortune seekers were joined by card sharks, prostitutes, bootleggers and drug dealers. The city became known as "Booger Town" as it attracted criminals and fugitives from the law. The town government soon fell under control of an organized crime syndicate led by Mayor Miller's shady associate, "Two-Gun Dick" Herwig. Dixon Street (now Tenth Street) was the "red-light" district, housing brothels, dance halls, speakeasies and gambling dens. Murder and robbery became an everyday occurrence and illegal moonshining and home brewing flourished under the fatherly watch of Hedwig and his henchmen, including W. J. (Shine) Popejoy, the king of the Texas bootleggers. Borger became so notorious that in the spring of 1927 Texas Governor Dan Moody sent a force of Texas Rangers to reign in the town. The Texas Rangers were led by Captains Frank Hamer and Thomas R. Hickman. (Hamer would go onto later fame and even infamy as the man who killed Bonnie and Clyde.) The Texas Rangers did have a stabilizing effect, but Borger still struggled with lawlessness and violence into the 1930s, climaxing with the murder of District Attorney John A. Holmes by an assassin on September 18, 1929. This event caused Governor Moody to impose martial law for a month and send in state troops to help rid the town of its criminal element. Eventually Borger settled down, but not before town founder Ace Borger was shot and killed at the post office by Arthur Huey on August 31, 1934 (Huey was County Treasurer and was irked at Ace Borger for not bailing him out of jail on an embezzlement charge. Huey shot Borger five times with a Colt .45 pistol, even pulling Borger's own pistol out of his clothing and shooting him again, along with others there in the post office).

By the late 1930s Borger was pushed from one era to another by the Great Depression. Phillips Petroleum and others profited from the oil fields in the area, but during this time the price of oil and gas dropped, ending the "boom" and rapid growth of Borger. Carbon black plants added black soot to the Dust Bowl storms, covering the town in layers of dark grime. "Okie" migrants forced off their foreclosed farms back in Oklahoma, found work in Borger plants and refineries. The Works Project Administration provided the town with new red brick streets as the ramshackle shacks throughout town were replaced by more permanent buildings. During WWII synthetic rubber and other petroleum products became important in the Borger area. By the 1960s the Borger area was one of the largest producers of oil, carbon black, and petrochemicals and supplies in the state. The creation of nearby Lake Meredith also added to the town's economy as an important recreational area. Today Borger remains an important shipping point for agricultural produce as well as for the petroleum products produced there. 


Geography.

Borger is located at  (35.662789, -101.401565).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.6 km² (8.7 mi²). 22.6 km² (8.7 mi²) of it is land and 0.11% is water.

In the world of comic book publishing Angel refers to one of two series published by Dark Horse Comics. Both of these series are based on the television series Angel. There have been a total of two series published so far. The first was halted after seventeen issues. The second volume was a mini-series.

Recently IDW Publishing have been publishing Angel comics, for example Old Friends.

Canonical issues.

Angel comics are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarizing their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as official Angel merchandise.

Mark Farren (born May 12, 1981 in Greencastle, County Donegal, Republic of Ireland) is an Irish footballer who currently plays as a centre-forward with League of Ireland club Derry City F.C.

Farren began his football career with a largely unsuccessful period, throughout which he was dogged by injury, in the youth setup at Tranmere Rovers. Following this, he returned to his home county to play for Finn Harps. A lack of first-team opportunities saw Farren move south to fellow First Division side Monaghan United. He became a regular in the Monaghan team and quickly gained a reputation as a promising, pacy striker with lots of potential. He earned a move to Derry City F.C. in late 2003 and although he began the 2004 season on the bench, Farren made his breakthrough under Gavin Dykes. His importance to the club was seen when he burst onto the scene with a crucial hat-trick against Limerick F.C. and another goal against his former club, Finn Harps, in the promotion/relegation play-offs.

Farren stayed clear of injury in the 2005 season to produce some magnificent displays. He finished the season as second top scorer with 18 league goals in 31 appearances. It was this excellent form that saw him named PFAI Player of the Year. With the signing of Kevin McHugh and the establishment of Gary Beckett as a top forward in League of Ireland football, Farren's starting place was placed under threat for the 2006 season. However, he returned to the form he showed in 2005 and did manage to hold down a regular spot in the team, with an especially strong finish to the season, which helped Derry win the FAI Cup. His efforts also helped keep Derry in the league title race up until the very last day of the season, only to see his club lose the title to Dublin rivals, Shelbourne FC, on goal difference. In all, Farren finished the 2006 season with 17 goals to his name - 9 in the League of Ireland and 8 in the cup competitions.

Iktimal Hage-Ali (b. 1984) is an Australian woman of Lebanese descent, who is an Alawite and who was a member of the government appointed Muslim Reference Group.  She is deputy chairwoman of the NSW Youth Advisory Council.  She has also recently won NSW Young Australian of the Year.  She is currently employed at the Attorney-General's Department in NSW as a project officer.

She was recently arrested in a cocaine bust eight days before receiving the NSW Young Australian of the Year award. She was released without charge. As a result however she has handed back her NSW Young Australian of the Year award, saying it would be selfish to hang onto it in light of the negative publicity.  She has complained that she is unable to defend herself in the media as she may be in contempt of court in doing so.
Friends of Hage-Ali suspect that she was the subject of a smear campaign. In December 2006, The Australian alleged that Detective Tamar Kilani and his brother Ahmed Kilani who is a co-founder of Muslim Village, had launched a smear campaign against her.  The Middle East Crime Squad has worked closely with Sheik Hilaly. Hage-Ali's friends suspect that the alleged smear campaign may be the result of her criticism of a sermon by Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly, or because she doesn't wear a head-scarf.  Ahmed Kilani said that allegations of a smear campaign were "absolutely ridiculous", and a police officer has called the link between the Detective and the forum "just a coincidence."  Members of Muslim Village have also reacted angrily to the claims. 

She lives in the heart of Sydney's Muslim community, in the south-western suburb of Punchbowl.

Wildlife Totemization is defined as defined as
 having a system of beliefs in which humans have mystical, emotional, reverential, and/or genealogical relationships with a totem; a natural object such as a plant or animal  (Hamazaki and Tanno, 2002);
 
Purpose.
It is a theory which seeks to explain why some wildlife management programs are particularly controversial. The general hypothesis is similar to wildlife symbolism, in that both theories state that in certain circumstances humans will imbue characteristics into a species of wildlife, not necessarily inherent in those species themselves.

Characteristics.
Characteristics of totemization include:
viewing the totem as a companion, a protector, or a progenitor;
Assimilating oneself to the totem;
Prohibiting the killing or eating of the totem;
A high degree of antipathy towards those who destroy the totem;

A supercalender is a stack of calenders consisting of alternating steel and fiber-covered rolls through which paper is passed to increase its density, smoothness and gloss.  It is similar to a calender except that alternate chilled cast iron and softer rolls are used. The rolls used to supercalender uncoated paper usually consist of cast iron and highly compressed paper, while the rolls used for coated paper are usually cast iron and highly compressed cotton. The finish produced varies according to the raw material used to make the paper and the pressure exerted on it, and ranges from the highest English finish to a highly glazed surface. Supercalendered papers are sometimes used for books containing fine line blocks or halftones because they print well from type and halftones, although for the latter they are not as good as coated paper.

<doc id="965437" title="Madhaviah Krishnan" nonfiltered="574" processed="569" dbindex="450579">
Madhaviah Krishnan () better known as M. Krishnan (30 June 1912-18 February 1996) was a pioneering Indian wildlife photographer, writer and naturalist.

Early life.
M. Krishnan was born in Tirunelveli on 30th June 1912 and was the youngest of eight siblings. His father was a Tamil writer and reformer A. Madhaviah who worked with the Salt and Abkari Department of the Government of Madras. His father's writings included one of the first realistic Tamil novels, Padmavathi Charithram published in 1898 and an English novel Thillai Govindan published in 1916. His father voluntarily retired from Government service and started a press from which he published a Tamil magazine called Panchamritam. When his father died in 1925, he was taken care of by his eldest sister, Lakshmi. 

Krishnan studied in the Hindu High School and developed an interest in literature, art and nature. His family lived in Mylapore, and it those days it was covered in shrub and teemed with bird life, jackals and blackbucks. Krishnan even had a pet mongoose. In 1927 Krishnan joined the Presidency College and graduated with a BA in 1931. He also took a keen interest in botany, taught by Professor P. F. Fyson. He accompanied Fyson on field trips to the Nilgiris and the Kodaikanal hills and also acquired watercolour painting techniques from Professor Fyson's wife. Krishnan did not do well in his education and jobs were not easy. One of his older brother's who was married to the daughter of Sir T. Vijairaghavachari of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa, took Krishnan to his father-in-law for advice. Krishnan was told that unless he managed to do well in studies, he could not be helped.

Writing.
For a while he made a living by writing to small magazines and publishing some of his drawings and caricatures. He initially wrote in several Tamil magazines. In 1942, he was offered employment by the Maharaja of Sandur near Bellary in Karnataka. Krishnan took up this position and the works he undertook included being a schoolteacher, judge, publicity officer and a political secretary to the Maharaja. He spent a lot of his time wandering in the wilderness, observing nature, tried grazing sheep, breeding pigeons to work in a pigeon postal system and writing. His essays on wildlife photography were published in The Illustrated Weekly of India in a series entitled Wildlife Photographers Diary. He also wrote in The Hindu by the pen-name of Z.

In 1949, Sandur was unified in the Indian republic. From 1950 he wrote a bi-weekly column in The Statesman of Calcutta called 'Country Notebook'. In this column he wrote about various aspects of natural history. This column continued for 46 years, from 1950 to February 18, 1996, the day he died.

Natural history.
Krishnan was an ecological patriot in that he opposed the introduction of exotic trees. He was once asked to speak at the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore and in late February, the Tabebuia trees were ablaze in flowers. Asked about his opinion on the flowers, he declared it as 'Disgraceful' and suggested that ... you should uproot all those foreign trees, and plant some of our own. 

Krishnan was responsible for the declaration of Vedanthangal as a bird sanctuary. He was aware that he was different from most conservationists of his time - who were either European or were from the Indian aristocracy of Muslims and Rajputs often former hunters - in being a vegetarian.

It has been noted that in 1972, Krishnan foresaw the possibility that elephants could communicate using sounds that were inaudible to the human ear. This infrasound communication was confirmed by later studies by Katherine Payne.

Photography.
Along with his whimsical prose, poetry and drawing he used photography as another tool for expression. He worked only with black and white film. His equipment was, according to naturalist E. P. Gee, 'a large, composite affair, with the body of one make and a tele lens of another, and other parts and accessories all ingeniously mounted together by himself. I cannot swear that I saw proverbial bootlace used to fix them all together, but I am sure there must have been some wire and hoop somewhere!' He called his equipment the Super Ponderosa. Krishnan was a not a big fan of technological advances and was unimpressed by the display of India's first jet aircraft. He declared them as mechanical, chemical and inhuman and was impressed more by the living muscular speed of animals... and if you want to see something sustained in its effortless, rhythmic impetuosity, you should watch a herd of blackbuck going all out for a few miles-there is tangible, real speed for you.

Philosophy.
Krishnan was unhappy with the Indian system of school education. In a 1947 essay, he wrote, 
...The average educated adult knows little or nothing of the teeming plant and animal life of the country, and cares less. Livestock does not interest him, and the world is to him a place which holds only human beings. He can never make friends with a hill or a dog, and if he has no one to talk to, no book to read, and no gadget to turn and unturn, he is quite lost. School education is solidly to blame for all this.

In 1967 he asked several university graduates to name two red-flowered tree or an exclusively Indian animal. Nobody passed his test and he wrote 
is there something radically wrong with the education and culture of our young men and women that they should not know the answers to these reasonable questions, or is it that I have become a monomaniac and am therefore unable to perceive how unfair my questions are ?

Writing about the Indian consciousness of nature he wrote 
the public (both literate and unlettered) has no interest in the great national heritage of wildlife, of which it knows little and for which it cares less.

He refused a paid invitation from Air India for a trip to London for eminent Indians. He refused on another occasion an invitation from the Smithsonian Institution. He was a fierce individualist and a recluse. Author Ramachandra Guha called him a self-reliant, Thoreauvian individualist who would not allow a mere government to pay for him. He however accepted the Padma Shri from the Indian Government in 1969.

In some of his writings he was critical and opinionated and was not well known for his diplomacy. He would refuse to let editors change his texts and that was his condition when asked to contribute a column. He fiercely argued that the usage Himalaya was correct and that a redundant 's' at its end did not respect its Sanskrit origin.

The David Suzuki Foundation is an environmental organization based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  It is a non-profit organization that is incorporated in both Canada and the United States.  Its current membership is approximately 40,000.

The Foundation describes its goal as to:

Work towards balancing human needs with the Earth's ability to sustain all life.  Our goal is to find and communicate practical ways to achieve that balance.;

Its origins lie in a 1989 "think-tank" retreat on Pender Island, British Columbia that was organized by David Suzuki and Tara Cullis.  A dozen concerned individuals were invited, and inspired by those discussions the Foundation was incorporated on September 14, 1990.  It officially opened its doors on January 1, 1991.

It is a federally registered Canadian charity supported entirely by Foundation grants and donations.  It does not accept any government funding.  It is also not a funding body for other organizations.  Currently the Foundation employs roughly three dozen staff members.

The Foundation focuses its work on four major projects and issues.  They are: 
 Climate Change and Global Warming;
 Ecosystem-based Forestry;
 Sustainable Fisheries;
 Aquaculture and Biodiversity;

As part of its work the Foundation publishes newsletters, scientific studies, research reports, books, information kits, brochures, and news releases.  It also has two ongoing programs to help reach its goals, the first is the Nature Challenge and the second is Sustainability Within A Generation.

 Nature Challenge .

As a mechanism to promote public awareness and action with regard to the Foundation's four focuses, the Foundation created the Nature Challenge program. In consultation with the Union of Concerned Scientists the Foundation researched the 10 most effective ways to help conserve nature and improve our quality of life, and invited the public to choose to live at least three of them in their daily lives.  Their list is:

 Reduce home energy use by 10% ;
 Choose an energy-efficient home & appliances ;
 Don't use pesticides;
 Eat meat-free meals one day a week ;
 Buy locally grown and produced food ;
 Choose a fuel-efficient vehicle ;
 Walk, bike, carpool or take transit;
 Choose a home close to work or school ;
 Support alternative transportation ;
 Learn more and share with others;

As of December 2004, over 140,000 individuals had taken the Nature Challenge.  Many famous Canadians are taking the Nature Challenge, including musician Nelly Furtado, musician Sam Roberts, author Margaret Atwood, author Robert Munsch, Mayor of Vancouver Larry Campbell, and Mayor of Toronto David Miller.

 Sustainability Within A Generation .

In an extensive OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) study, Canada finished 28th out of 29 developed countries in categories such as water, air, waste, and climate change.  The Foundation created a report that addresses Canada's capacities to improve sustainability and environmental conservation.  The Foundation believes this can be best accomplished by improving efficiency, eliminating waste and pollution, and building sustainable cities.

In February 2004 David Suzuki met with the then Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin to present the Foundation's report on how sustainability could be achieved within a generation.

<doc id="827477" title="K Street (Washington, D.C.)" nonfiltered="577" processed="572" dbindex="450582">


K Street is a major thoroughfare in the United States capital of Washington, D.C. known for the numerous think tanks, lobbyists, and advocacy groups that exercise influence from this location.

Location in the city.

There are two separate roads designated K Street in Washington, D.C.; they are east-west streets in D.C.'s northern half and southern half. When not being qualified, K Street almost always refers to the northern K Street, as it is the more famous of the two.

The northern K Street has its western starting point as K St. N.W. just west of the abutment of the old Aqueduct Bridge in the southern part of Georgetown in the city's Northwestern quadrant.  The Georgetown section of K Street was called Water Street until the Georgetown street renaming of 1895.  West of 33rd Street, the United States Postal Service still recognizes both "K Street" and "Water Street" in addresses.

The road crosses Rock Creek and enters the area surrounding Farragut Square park, where it is exceptionally wide due to parallel service lanes (described below). Farther east, the street eventually changes designation from K St., N.W., to K St., N.E., after intersecting North Capitol Street,  the boundary between the Washington's northwestern and northeastern quadrants. This K Street's eastern end is at Florida Avenue in the Near Northeast neighborhood, just south of Gallaudet University.

In alignment with the city's Cartesian-coordinate-based street system, there is another K Street in its southern half; this one running between the Potomac River at the western edge of the Southwestern quadrant (as K St. S.W.) to the Anacostia River at the eastern edge of the Southeastern quadrant (as K St. S.E.).

Traffic configuration.
Current.

K Street provides a major east-west thoroughfare for traffic through Washington, primarily from Mount Vernon Square (location of the new Washington Convention Center) to the Whitehurst Freeway.  K Street also runs through Georgetown under the Whitehurst Freeway; however, most westbound traffic exits to the freeway.  A segment of U.S. Highway 29 runs along K Street.  K Street also runs as a tunnel underneath Washington Circle, allowing traffic to avoid the circle, which is an intersection with 23rd St, Pennsylvania Ave, and New Hampshire Ave.

Service roadways and main roadway.

Portions of the street, in both directions, are divided into both "local" (or service) lanes and "express" lanes, allowing through traffic to, hopefully, travel more smoothly across town.  However, since that division of traffic lanes is universally acknowledged to be a failure, local officials have proposed to remove the barriers to make room for a busway (see next section).

Proposed.

Because of K Street's standing as a major thoroughfare, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the local transit authority, has been studying K Street, and has considered turning it into a busway. The scope of the project would be to have the busway run from Georgetown University, across Downtown Washington on K Street, switching to Massachusetts Avenue at Mount Vernon Square, and finishing at Union Station.  The DC Circulator east-west route provides service along most of that route, although the DC Circulator must share right of way with other vehicles.

Lobbying.

"K Street" is a common metonym for Washington's lobbying industry. Many of the major Washington lobbying firms are located on the section which passes from Georgetown through a portion of Downtown D.C.  This part of the street is sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government. Lobbying firms are thought to have great influence in U.S. national politics due to monetary resources and the revolving door policy of hiring former government officials. K Street firms often hire ex-politicians from both major parties since the party in power can vary between elections and among the legislative and executive branches in government.

The K Street Project, according to former Washington Monthly editor Nicholas Confessore, is an attempt to build a new Republican political machine "built upon patronage, contracts and one-party rule ... among Washington's thousands of trade associations and corporate offices, their tens of thousands of employees and the hundreds of millions of dollars in political money at their disposal."

The theory behind the project, Confessore wrote, boils down to this: "As Republicans control more and more K Street jobs, they will reap more and more K Street money, which will help them win larger and larger majorities on the Hill."

The Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal, which contributed to the slippage of Republicans into minority status in both houses of Congress in the   2006 midterm elections, has called the future of the K Street Project into question.

K Street in the media.

The Associated Press Washington Bureau and the AP Broadcast News Center are situated on K Street. The street also inspired a television series on the HBO network by the same name, K Street.

<doc id="1865122" title="Comet Cursor" nonfiltered="579" processed="574" dbindex="450584">
Comet Cursor was a software program manufactured by Comet Systems.  It allowed users of Microsoft Windows Operating System to change the appearance of their mouse's cursor and to allow websites to use customized cursors for visitors.  The product was introduced as an enhancement to website design and to enable advertisers to use the cursor for their campaigns. Companies using the Comet Cursor for advertising included AT&T, Energizer, and Procter & Gamble. 

In the late 1990's the small software application became both highly popular and controversial. At its height, over 350,000 websites, including those of Warner Bros., Comedy Central, Dilbert, and Paramount's Star Trek, were using the company's technology to alter the cursor image for their visitors. Many smaller sites used the technology through the company's viral affiliate program called (initially) LiveCursors and (later) CometZone. The Comet Cursor appeared in stories by Newsweek, The New York Times, USA Today, and won AdWeek Magazine's award for "Best Marketing Technology of the Year."

At around the same time that the Comet Cursor had been downloaded 10 million times, the company became controversial. In November of 1999, the company started distributing its software as part of a package with several versions of RealNetworks's Real Player RealPlayer multimedia software. That same month, the RealPlayer was accused of violating the privacy of its users and breaching its own privacy policy by collecting information about what software was installed alongside the RealPlayer. This accusation came at a time when online privacy issues were front page news and this story was widely reported. Later that month, two stories ran concurrently in the AP wire service and USA Today accusing the Comet Cursor software of communicating through a backchannel with Comet Systems' servers. The AP story in particular claimed that Comet Systems tracked its users' movements online, a claim against which the company protested. As a result of the negative publicity, many websites removed the Comet Cursor technology, including (as described in the USA Today story) the official website for Al Gore's candidacy for President of the United States.

Despite attempts by the company to defend itself, many people concluded that the Comet Cursor was "spyware". This impression was reinforced by the product's growing ubiquity (ultimately, it was downloaded and installed more than 200 million times). The criticism focused on an installation method that led to unintended installations. Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser  software enabled ActiveX controls such as the Comet Cursor to install themselves with a single affirmative click by a user (and no clicks if the browser's security was set to "low"). This, combined with the bundling relationship with the RealPlayer, caused many Internet Explorer users and IT admininstrators to complain that they were forced to remove the Comet Cursor multiple times. The company denied that it used any non-standard or surreptitious means to distribute its software but this did not allay many of its critics. The Comet Cursor was cited as one of the 25 Worst Products by PC World Magazine. Although no longer distributed, the product remains controversial and has been blacklisted as spyware by some internet watchdog companies such as Lavasoft and Symantec but not by others, such as CNet or ZDNet. 

Comet Systems shifted its focus away from simple cursor-changing when it introduced a product called "Smart Cursors" and later several other reference, search, and toolbar products, in partnership with the American Heritage Dictionary, Encyclopedia Britannica, Google, Orbitz, and Overture (Yahoo). The company was acquired for $33.5 million by FindWhat.com (MIVA) in February of 2004 and the Comet Cursor has since been phased out of their product line.

"Ordinary World" is the 23rd single by Duran Duran, and the first single from The Wedding Album.  It was released in December 1992 in the United States and January 1993 in the United Kingdom, reaching the top ten in both countries.

About the song. 
By the early 90s, Duran Duran's once-Beatlesque popularity had faded. Their album Liberty had proved a commercial failure, its two singles failing to make a significant showing on British or American charts.

It wasn't until Capitol leaked "Ordinary World" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again. The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up, ultimately releasing it in December. In the UK, the original January release date stood.

Simon LeBon would go on to sing the song with Pavarotti at a WarChild benefit, which was released on home video as Pavarotti & Friends: Together for the Children of Bosnia. Le Bon later said of the event, "If you're talking about name dropping, he's one of the biggest names you could drop, Pav-The-Man."

The strings in the song were arranged and performed by Nick Rhodes, using a Kurzweil K2000, the first digital synthesizer that was able to recreate any sound.

The song won an Ivor Novello Award in May 1994.

Music video. 
The video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in Pasadena, California.

B-sides, bonus tracks and remixes. 
To capitalise on the success of "Ordinary World" and the new Duran Duran fans it was finding, EMI used the single's release to lure these new fans to the band's back catalogue. This mini- was spread over the two CD singles released during the campaign.

Other Mixes.
An acoustic version of the song was included on the band's next release, the "Come Undone" single.

There were several other versions of "Ordinary World" released. 

 The "Acoustic version" was recorded at the May 15 "No Ordinary Tour" live performance at Tower Records in Hollywood, which was simulcast to Hard Rock Cafés around the world. This live version was found on a number of "Ordinary World" releases outside the UK, most notably the Canadian and American cassette single. It would eventually be released in the UK on the first CD single for "Come Undone".;

 The "AC edit" was featured on a US promo CD that came packaged with the  album.

 A version recorded live on Simon Mayo's Radio 1 show would surface in 1995 as a b-side to "White Lines". ;

 A 6:08 version, recorded at Sony Studios in New York City for Hard Rock Live, was included on a promotional 2-track CD in June 2000 by the band's new label Hollywood Records.

Covers, samples, & media references. 
The song has been covered by River Fenix, Something for Kate, Stereo Blonde, Aurora, Kurt Nilsen, and Mandy Kane.

The song appeared in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005.

Chart positions. 
Ordinary World peaked at #3 in the US and held at #6 in the UK.

There are various cultures in which the Money Dance or Dollar Dance or Apron Dance is a traditional part of the wedding reception. In such cultures, the guests are prepared with money and know what to do.

The concept of "Money Dance" is that the male guests pay for the privilege of dancing with the bride, and by extension, female guests pay for the privilege of dancing with the groom. The custom originated in Poland and is still celebrated at many ethnic and blue-collar weddings today. The money is to be used for the bride and groom's honeymoon or to give them a little extra cash with which to set up housekeeping.

The dance takes place some time after the First dance, often once guests have had a chance to have a few drinks. The best man or MC or the Disc-Jockey announces the event. Customarily, the best man begins dancing with the bride, pinning money onto her wedding gown or putting it into a purse which she carries especially for the purpose or into the pockets of an apron she dons over her gown especially for this dance. In a newer version of this custom, the dance includes bridesmaids and other ladies who dance with the groom and pin money on his lapel. Each of the guests who dance with the bride or groom, respectively, takes only a few moments before another guest cuts in.

At Ukrainian weddings, the father of the bride usually begins, pinning money on her dress. He is followed by the best man and groomsmen, and, finally, by the remainder of the male guests. At Yugoslavian weddings, instead of pinning the money on the bride's gown, the male guests give the money to the best man for safe keeping. At Hungarian and Portuguese weddings, the bride takes off her shoes and puts them in the middle of the dance floor. Then the shoes are passed around from guests to guest and each deposits a contribution.

<doc id="8850676" title="Treaty of Waitangi Act" nonfiltered="588" processed="583" dbindex="450593">


The Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 established the Waitangi Tribunal and gave the Treaty of Waitangi recognition in New Zealand law for the first time. The Tribunal was empowered to investigate possible breaches of the Treaty by the New Zealand government or any state-controlled body, occurring after 1975. It was also empowered to recommend, but not enforce, remedies. 

Although the Treaty had been a focus of M ori protest for several years by 1975, many M ori were unhappy with the Act. Most of the significant breaches of the Treaty, such as land confiscation in the New Zealand Wars, had occurred in the nineteenth century, and the Tribunal was powerless to investigate these. Some P keh , including many in the National Party opposition, opposed the Act on the grounds that it would be divisive. 

1985 Amendment.

This enabled the Tribunal to investigate claims dating back to 1840, when the Treaty was signed. It also enlarged the Tribunal's membership to enable it to handle the increased number of claims. It also required the Tribunal to have a M ori majority.

The 1985 amendment considerably broadened the scope of the Tribunal's inquiries and led to ongoing debate over the appropriate response by the Crown to the findings and recommendations of the Tribunal (see Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements). It was part of the Fourth Labour government's policy of giving greater acknowledgment to the Treaty, as was the inclusion of references to the Treaty in other legislation, such as the State Owned Enterprises Act. This amendment was one of the most important steps towards making the Treaty relevant in New Zealand law and society.

1988 Amendment.

This further expanded the Tribunal's membership and abolished the requirement for a M ori majority. It also enabled different groups of Tribunal members to investigate different claims simultaneously.

1988 Amendment (State Enterprises).

This amendment came about following a court case in which the government was found to be ignoring the principles of the Treaty by attempting to sell state-owned land which might be subject to Treaty claims. The amendment enabled covenants to be placed on such land stating that it might be claimed back by the Tribunal, even if in private hands. It also gave the Tribunal the power to compulsorily acquire such land. This is the only instance in which the Tribunal is able to issue legally binding orders.

1993 Amendment.

This amendment came about following the controversial recommendation in the Waitangi Tribunal's Te Roroa Report  that the Crown purchase an area of private land for return to claimants in a settlement.  The owners of the land argued that the recommendation devalued their properties.  The amendment prohibits the Tribunal from recommending the return or purchase by the Crown of any private land, other than that covered by the covenants noted above.

2006 Amendment (Maori Purposes Bill).

This amends section 6 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act to set a closing date of 1 September 2008 for submitting historical Treaty claims, defined as those relating to acts or omissions of the Crown prior to 21 September 1992.  It allows existing claims to be amended and does not affect the settlement of historical claims that have already been lodged, or the ability to lodge claims relating to grievances relating to acts or omissions after September 1992.

Other amendments.

Legislation implementing various historical Treaty settlements amends section 6 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act to exclude the jurisdiction of the Waitangi Tribunal from further considering the historical claims of the group receiving the settlement.

Tschandala (old German transcription of Chandala) is a term Nietzsche borrowed from the Indian caste-system, where a Tschandala is a member of the lowest social class. For Nietzsche, the Tschandala marks the notion opposite ("Gegensatz-Begriff") to the Übermensch . The Tschandala is a product of the uncontrolled mixture of races and classes, he is a hodge-podge human (Mischmasch-Mensch). According to Nietzsche, Christianity, born out of Judaism and only understandable by this origin, is the adequate religion of the Tschandala (cf. The Twilight of the Idols/Die Goetzendaemmerung).

Abae (rabai), is a town in the N.E. corner of Phocis, in
Greece, famous in early times for its oracle of Apollo, 
one of those consulted by Croesus (Herod. i. 46). It was 
rich in treasures (Herod. viii. 33), but was sacked by the 
Persians, and the temple remained in a ruined state.  The 
oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the Thebans 
before Leuctra (Paus. iv. 32. 5). The temple seems to have 
been burnt again during the Sacred War, and was in a very 
dilapidated state when seen by Pausanias (x. 35), though 
some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, 
was undertaken by Hadrian.  The sanctity of the shrine 
ensured certain privileges to the people of Abac (Bull.  
Corresp.  Hell. vi. 171), and these were confirmed by the 
Romans.  The polygonal walls of the acropolis may still be 
seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill 
standing about 500 ft. above the little plain of Exarcho; 
one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls 
below.  The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the 
town.  An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are 
a stoa and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the 
British School at Athens in 1894, but very little was found.

It had a wingspan of about 100 centimetres and at the end of its long bony tail was perhaps a diamond-shaped flap.  The flap may have helped it steer while in the air. It showed a strong dimorphism of the teeth, hence its name "true dimorphic tooth". The species, then the oldest pterosaurian known, was found in 1973 by Mario Pandolfi and described that same year by Rocco Zambelli. Despite its age it has few primitive characters.

Prank Week, a PCA tradition where returning students prank new ones, has begun. The girls decide to prank the boys back.  The boys were supposed to keep a statue of the founder of PCA clean, so Zoey comes up with a prank and the girls put girl clothes on it. But when the son of PCA's founder sees it, he is very angry, and Zoey says that it was entirely her idea because she doesn't want to get the other girls in trouble, so he is going to expell her, but says she first must apologize to the entire school. So Logan comes up with an idea to save Zoey: While she was apologizing, all the students said, "If you're gonna expel Zoey, you'll have to expel me too, so the principal says that they can't expell all of them, so he decides that no one will get expelled.

Yehoshua ben Gamla was a Jewish high priest who officiated in about 64 C.E. He married the rich widow Martha of the high-priestly family Boethos (Yeb. vi. 4), and she by bribing Agrippa II (not Jannai, as Talmudic sources say) secured for him the office of high priest (Yeb. 61a; Yoma 18a; comp. "Ant." xx. 9, § 4). Although Yehoshua himself was not a scholar, he was solicitous for the instruction of the young, and provided schools in every town for children over five years of age, earning thereby the praises of posterity (B. B. 21a). The two lots used on the Day of Atonement, hitherto of boxwood, he made of gold (Yoma iii. 9).

Yehoshua did not remain long in office, being forced, after a year, to give way to Matthias ben Theophil ("Ant." xx. 9, § 7). Together with the former high priest Anan and other men of rank, he opposed, but without success, the election of Phinehas b. Samuel (68) as high priest ("B. J." iv. 3, § 9). He attempted peaceably to prevent the fanatic and pugnacious Idumeans from entering Jerusalem, then torn by internal dissensions. After they had come into possession of the city, these fanatics took bloody vengeance on him, by executing him, as well as Anan, as traitors to their country (68) ("B. J." iv. 5, § 2).

The Tropicana Resort & Casino is located on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Columbia Sussex. The hotel has 1,871 rooms and is attached to a 61,000 square foot (5,667 m ) casino.  The Tropicana also has 110,000 square feet of convention and exhibit space.

The main original building, with the Garden room wings, was built in 1957. The Paradise Tower, a hotel tower consisting of 21 floors of guestrooms and suites, was built in 1979 as the Tiffany Tower, adjoining the resort's Tiffany Theatre, home to the Folies Bergere production show. A 22-story Island Tower was later constructed in 1986.

This location, Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection, has the most hotel rooms of any intersection in the world and as a result is extremely busy.  Pedestrians are not allowed to cross at street level.  Instead, the Tropicana is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to its neighboring casinos: to the north across Tropicana Avenue, the MGM Grand Las Vegas, and to the west across the Strip, the Excalibur.

In March 2006, Aztar announced that it would be acquired by Pinnacle Entertainment, Corporation of Las Vegas.  However, A bidding war for Aztar ensued with several different companies battling for control of assets.  In May of 2006, Kentucky based hotel-casino operator Columbia Sussex won the bidding war, agreeing to pay $2.75 billion for the company.  The acquisition was approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission on November 17, 2006 and is expected to be completed in December 2006.  




Future Plans.

On November 2, 2006, Columbia Sussex publicly announced a $2  billion renovation of the Tropicana. Unlike previous Las Vegas projects however, there will be no demolition of the entire resort. The existing Paradise and Island towers will receive both interior and exterior renovations and 4 new towers will be built on the property (the last will be branded as a separate hotel).  

Also unusual, is that the resort will remain open during the renovations, which will increase the size of the hotel to over 8,000 rooms.  There are also plans to add a 600,000 square foot convention center to the resort, which will be the 5th largest convention center in Las Vegas; after the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Sands Expo and Convention Center, the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, and the convention center at Echelon Place (currently in the planning stages). News Article.

Present Amenities and entertainment.
In addition to the casino, the Tropicana includes a showroom, spa, comedy club, swimming pool and numerous shops. In 2005 the hotel had featured, and since May 26, 2006 is featuring again the Titanic the Artifacts Exhibition, with more than 300 artifacts from the doomed ocean liner, and Xtreme Magic, a production show starring Dirk Arthur, featuring tigers and leopards.

NHL Hitz 20-02 (sometimes called NHL Hitz 2002) is an arcade-style ice hockey videogame released by Midway. Midway launched this game along with NFL Blitz. The game was a launch title for the Nintendo Gamecube and was also released on Xbox and PlayStation 2. It differs from EA Sports' traditional NHL games in that it does not try to accurately simulate real-life ice hockey. The rules are much more relaxed and the attributes of players dramatically increased, giving the game its arcadey feel. The game is most notable for its use of a limited number of players (three skaters on the ice at any time plus one goaltender, with only 7 total players to choose from).

<doc id="1218519" title="Human rights in Turkey" nonfiltered="611" processed="606" dbindex="450616">




The Republic of Turkey was one of the first nations to ratify the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in April 1949 . It has also signed the European Convention on Human Rights in 1954  and as such the Turkish Constitution guarantees the fundamental human rights of all Turkish citizens and affirms the secular and democratic nature of the Turkish republic. Turkey has also ratified the 1987 European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Punishment in 1988 . Nevertheless, its practical human rights record has long continued to attract attention, both internally and externally. Turkey is currently in the accession negotiations with the European Union, but there are still concerns raised by certain NGOs and the EU, especially with regards to the freedom of expression and the situation of ethnic minorities.

Overview.
Part Two of the constitution is entitled the Fundamental Rights and Duties and is its bill of rights. Article Twelve guarantees "fundamental rights and freedoms", which are defined as including the right to life, security of person and right to property in Articles 17, 19 and 35, respectively. Many of these entrenched rights have their basis in international bills of rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Turkey was one of the first nations to ratify in April 1949 .

In 2005, there have been 2302 applications lodged against the Republic of Turkey before the European Court of Human Rights and consequently 290 judgments on the merits have been issued affirming 270 violations and 9 non-violations .

Individual rights.
Right to life.
There have been no applications of the capital punishment in Turkey since 1984 and the practice was formally abolished for offences during peacetime in 2002, and for offences during wartime in 2004.

Gender equality.
In the 1930s, Turkey became one of the first countries in the world to give full political rights to women, including the right to elect (in 1930) and to be elected (in 1934), to every political office.

Article 10 of the Turkish Constitution bans any discrimination, state or private, on the grounds of sex. Turkey was one of the first countries to elect a female prime minister, Tansu Çiller in 1995. It is also the first country which had a woman as the President of its Constitutional Court, Tülay Tu cu, who is still in office. In addition, Turkish Council of State, the court of last resort for administrative cases, also has a woman judge Sumru Çörto lu as its President. Since 1985, Turkish women have the right to freely exercise abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and the right to contraceptive medicine paid for by the Social Security. This is in contrast with the policies of certain EU countries, such as Poland and Ireland, that ban abortion and deny this right to women. Modifications to the Civil Code in 1926 gave the right to women to initiate and obtain a divorce, a right still not recognized in Malta, a EU country.

Nevertheless, in remote parts of the country, such as Southeastern Anatolia, older attitudes prevail amongs the local Kurdish population, and women still face domestic violence, forced marriages, and so-called honor killings. Nearly all of these so-called honor killings take place among the Kurdish population and persons found guilty of this crime are sentenced to life in prison per the Turkish Penal Code. State authorities engaged in stamping out such practices are often accused of racism and of trying to suppress Kurdish culture. To combat this, the government and various other foundations are engaged in education campaigns in Southeastern Anatolia to improve the rate of literacy and education levels of women.

Recently critics have pointed out that Turkey has become a major market for foreign women who are coaxed and forcibly brought to the country by international mafia to work as sex slaves, especially in big and touristic cities.

Freedom of expression.
Article 26 of the Constitution guarantees the freedom of expression. However, there have been particular concerns over the restrictions on the publication and diffusion of material relating primarily to highly sensitive political subjects. According to the writers' advocacy group International PEN, roughly 60 writers, publishers and journalists have been brought charged under the 301st Article of the Turkish Penal Code that states: "A person who publicly insults being a Turk, the Republic or the Turkish Grand National Assembly, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months to three years." Even though certain high-profile cases (such as Orhan Pamuk or Elif  afak, both about assertions related to the Armenian Genocide, an event that is disputed by Turkey) have ended in acquittals, the outcome of other cases are unclear. Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was convicted under Article 301 and given a suspended 6-month sentence, shortly before being assassinated on January 19, 2007.

Freedom of the press.
Articles 27 and 28 of the Turkish Constitution guarantee the "freedom of expression" and "unhindered dissemination of thought". However, alinea 2 of Article 27 affirms that "the right to disseminate shall not be exercised for the purpose of changing the provisions of Articles 1, 2 and 3 of  Constitution", articles in question referring to the unitary, secular, democratic and republican nature of the state.

Since the liberalization of the audiovisual market in 1991, Turkey has developed an extremely vibrant and dynamic media. There are thousands of newspapers, TV channels and radio stations in the country, and they are guaranteed freedom in their editorial decisions by the constitution. The state-owned TRT has been broadcasting short programmes in a number of minority languages, including Bosnian and Kurdish, since 2003. For the Kurdish language programmes, this is rather symbolic in terms of the number of minutes of programmes per week. 

Nevertheless, it has been claimed that the Turkish authorities appear to interpret this freedom in a more restrictive way compared to other modern secular states of the European Union and North America. All independent observers note that even though the non-Turkish media enjoys the same freedom as their Turkish counterparts, this is not true for media in Kurdish.

Press freedom groups have raised concerns over the use of criminal defamation laws to punish those who criticise authorities.

Freedom of conscience.
Although its population is overwhelmingly Muslim, Turkey is a secular country per Article 3 of its constitution, and thus has no official religion. Secularism in Turkey originates from Atatürk's 'Six Arrows' of Republicanism, Populism, Laïcité, Reformism, Nationalism, and Statism. 

Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution guarantees all residents of Turkey the right to adhere to any religion or philosophical belief, with some exceptions made for their expression in public spaces.  The Constitutional Court has interpreted secularism in a way that doesn't allow for a person to wear religious symbols (e.g. a head scarf or a cross) in governmental and public institutions, and particularly while attending schools and universities. Nevertheless it must be noted that, in its decision on November 10, 2005, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that such a ban was "legitimate" to prevent the influence of religion in state affairs.

Conforming with the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court and the Council of State on secularism, faith-based schools are banned and all schools must follow a secular curriculum. Religious education may only be given by appointed teachers who have studied at Turkey's secular universities. In practice, only Sunni theology is taught.

There is a de-facto domination of Sunni school of Islam within Turkish society, despite the protections offered by formal secularism. Sunni imams are nominated and paid by the state directorate of religious affairs. The Alevis pray in Cemevis, but the government funds only the building of mosques. Even though there have been attempts to expand state religious funding to Alevites, they are not considered a different muslim school, but as part of the Sunni branch.

The situation of the non-Muslim minorities has also been open to criticism. The government doesn't nominate, nor pay for, any non-Muslim religious leaders. However, it must be noted that, most of these minorities prefer electing their own spiritual leaders and would be equally offended if the state were to do so for them. Turkey has been criticized by Greece, the European Union and several human rights NGOs for its refusal to recognize the Ecumenical title of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul and the closing of the Greek Orthodox theological school in Heybeliada (Halki), Istanbul.

Gay rights.


Homosexual sexual relationships between consenting adults in private is not a crime in Turkey. The age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual sex is eighteen. On the other hand, the criminal code has vaguely worded prohibitions on "public exhibitionism" and "offenses against public morality" that are sometimes used to discriminate against the LGBT community. As of 2006, Turkey neither has a law permitting homosexuals to get married, nor does it have a law against the discrimination of Turkey's LGBT community.

Disabled citizens.
In recent years, the Turkish parliament has approved certain major laws to fight against and end discrimination against the disabled. However, this has not shown the desired effects on the ground because of a lack of economic resources and the absence of awareness programs.

In one particular case, Mental Disability Rights International (MDRI), an advocacy group for people with mental disabilities, has criticized the treatment of the mentally ill in a report called "Behind Closed Doors: Human Rights Abuses in the Psychiatric Facilities, Orphanages and Rehabilitation Centers of Turkey". As a result of this criticism, Turkey's largest psychiatric hospital, the Bak rköy state hospital in Istanbul, has announced that it has abolished the use of "unmodified" ECT procedures.

Conscientious objectors.
The issue of conscientious objectors is highly controversial in the country. Turkey and Azerbaijan are the only members of the Council of Europe that refuse to recognize the right to conscientious objection. In January 2006, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey had violated Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights that prohibits degrading treatment in a case dealing with conscientious objection. Another conscientious objector, Mehmet Tarhan, was sentenced to four years in prison by a military court in 2005 for refusing to do his military service, but he was later released in March 2006. In a related case, journalist Perihan Ma den was tried by a Turkish court for supporting Tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right; but she was acquitted.

Group rights.
Ethnic groups.
Turkish society contains elements from every nationality of the Ottoman Empire. Some Turks are descended from non-Turkic Ottoman nationalities who adopted a Turkish identity and some of them also see themselves as still belonging to one of those minority groups, often as a sub-group within the main Turkish society. 

According to the Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution, "everyone bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a Turk". The Constitution affirms the principal of the indivisibility of the Turkish Nation and of constitutional citizenship that is not based on ethnicity. Consequently, Turkish refers to all citizens of Turkey. It considers that since all Turkish citizens have the same rights and benefits of citizenship, there is no such nomenclature as minority in Turkey, except for the three minorities recognized by the Treaty of Lausanne signed before the proclamation of the Republic: Greek, Armenian and Jewish minorities.

Until recent reforms, there were many legal restrictions on publishing in languages other than the only official one, Turkish, and publications in minority languages were not allowed. Since then, minorities have the right to publish and diffuse media, such as newspapers or audiovisual channels, in their own languages and operate private courses that teach any language spoken in Turkey. Turkish is still the only language that can be used in schools and universities as a first language.

There have been certain calls by certain NGOs that Turkey should adopt the definitions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. If Turkey were to become a signatory to this treaty, it would have to accept and subsidise the education of minorities in their own first languages, and that for at least all the period of mandatory education. However, it must be noted that, even France, a founding member of the European Union, has refused to apply this treaty within its territory following a ruling by its own Constitutional Court that has affirmed that doing so would be contrary to the principle of the indivisibility of the Republic and the nation affirmed in the First Article of the French Constitution. In addition to France, many other EU countries, namely Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Portugal have also refused to ratify this treaty. To this day only 21 member states of the Council of Europe out of 49 have proceeded with ratification.

Kurdish people.



During the 1980s and 1990s, Turkey displaced a big number of its citizens in Southeastern Anatolia from rural areas, allegedly to protect them from guerilla violence of the Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) , that is considered as a terrorist organization by the US, the European Union and many other states. Turkey has claimed that the actions of the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) included burning of 'deserted' villages in order for the PKK not to use them as outposts or hiding places. 

Clashes between Turkish and PKK militants have resulted in some 30,000 casualties according a report by the    Estimates suggest that 3 million people remain internally displaced and unable to return to their villages.

It has been claimed that the scale and importance of those bombings and of the displacements of civil population were out of proportion for a state's peaceful policy towards its citizens . In several of its rulings, the European Court of Human Rights has condemned Turkey of human rights violations against its citizens of Kurdish origin.

Certain academics have claimed that successive Turkish governments adopted a sustained genocide program against Kurds, aimed at their assimilation. Desmond Fernandes, a Senior Lecturer at De Montfort University, breaks down the policy of the Turkish authorities into the following categories:

Forced assimilation program, which involved inter alia a ban of the Kurdish language, and the forced relocation of Kurds to non-Kurdish areas of Turkey;
The banning any organizations opposed to category one;
The violent repression of any Kurdish resistance.

The genocide theory remains, however, a minority view among historians, and is not endorsed by any nation or major organisation.

Workers rights.
The Constitution affirms the right of workers to form labor unions "without obtaining permission" and "to possess the right to become a member of a union and to freely withdraw from membership" (Article 51). Articles 53 and 54 affirm the right of workers to bargain collectively and to strike, respectively. However, rates of membership in labor unions are quite low, due to the fact that Turkish economy still experiences difficulties with corruption and massive numbers of workers not declared to the Social Security.

Turkey has had a standard state-run pensions system based on European models since the 1930s. Furthermore, since 1996, Turkey has a state-run unemployment insurance system, obligatory for all declared workers.

International criticism.
Turkey has been criticized by a number of international human rights NGOs for its violations of certain rights of its citizens. The European Union has been the biggest critic of Turkey's human rights record and this has hindered Turkey's accession process to join the EU. The European Court of Human Rights has also issued many rulings highly critical of Turkey's human rights record and other NGOs, such as the Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch, have also been critical of Turkey.

The current AKP-led government has tried on certain occasions, but failed, to strengthen legal provisions that are more restrictive, such as making adultery a criminal offence that is in line with orthodox Islamic teaching. Proponents of the proposal however, claimed that the law in question would have prevented the practice of polygamy, which can still be encountered in remote rural areas . In any case, in the light of the recent jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court that had struck down a similar provision for being unconstitutional in 1992, all jurists agree that it would have done so again, even if it were to become law.

Frederic Charles Smerlas (b. 8 April 1957 in Waltham, Massachusetts) was a 5-time NFL Pro Bowl selection during 14-year career as a nose tackle with the Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers, and New England Patriots.

Smerlas, of Greek-American descent, graduated from Waltham High School in 1975, where he was a star football player and wrestler. He became a defensive lineman for Boston College before embarking on an NFL career. His 1990 autobiography, By a Nose, recounts his eleven years with the Buffalo Bills and their climb from cellar-dwellers to Super Bowl contenders.

Smerlas currently resides in Sudbury, Massachusetts and is a part-time co-host during football season on Sportsradio WEEI with Glenn Ordway on the Big Show, as well as a contributor to western New York radio stations WGR in Buffalo and WHAM in Rochester. He also co-hosts a Waltham cable-access show, called "Armchair Quarterback." Smerlas is an avid motorcyclist, who often rides to support various Boston based charitable organizations. 

In December of 2006, Smerlas had his New England Patriots season tickets revoked, because according to Boston.com, he was scalping his tickets at a large markup by creating a ticket resale program " All Pro Celebrity Tailgate". Smerlas and Ordway were mentioned by name in the article, but both feel they did nothing wrong.

Summersville Lake is a man-made reservoir located in the US state of West Virginia. The lake is formed by an earthen impoundment (Summersville Dam) of the Gauley River, south of Summersville in Nicholas County.

The lake was constructed between 1960 and 1966 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in order to control flooding along the Gauley River and the Kanawha River. The lake also serves as a recreation area for fishing, boating, and especially scuba diving.

Wiccan (Billy Kaplan) is a fictional character and member of the Young Avengers, a team of superheroes in the Marvel Universe. His appearance is patterned on that of Thor and Scarlet Witch.

He first appeared in Young Avengers #1 (April, 2005).  The issue was scripted by Allan Heinberg and drawn by Jim Cheung.

Fictional character history.
Billy Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to cardiologist Jeff Kaplan and psychologist Rebecca Kaplan.  

Regularly bullied in school, Billy found solace outside the gates of the Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy encountered the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the next time it happens. She then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly.  The flash heals Billy's wounds and a few weeks later he stands up for another kid being bullied, and demonstrates his powers for the first time, but is not fully prepared for their effects.

Young Avengers.
He was one of the Young Avengers chosen as a result of the Vision's plan for the reformation of the Avengers, in the event the team ever disbanded. He originally chose the code name Asgardian.

The full extent of his powers are unknown, though they include flight and lightning generation. In Young Avengers #5, it is revealed that he can cast spells using a technique learned from "self-help books" owned by fellow Young Avenger Hulkling's mother. By chanting a mantra/statement of intent (for example, "I want Iron Lad to forget") and focusing on the outcome he wants to achieve, he can cause different events and effects to happen.

The team was then told to disband by Captain America. The Young Avengers decided to ignore him. Kate Bishop told Billy that he should change his codename to avoid the obvious puns when the press discovers that he's in a relationship with Hulkling. Kate, along with Stature, suggested the codename, "Wiccan."  Billy, smiling, replied that he doesn't hate it.

Parentage.

Billy has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers. In Young Avengers #11, Billy's possible relationship to Wanda was revealed by the Super-Skrull and Vision. In the past, Scarlet Witch was so desperate to have children that she used her reality warping powers to create twin sons out of fragments of the soul of the demon Mephisto. When the boys' souls were reabsorbed into Mephisto, they destroyed him and their souls were reincarnated as Thomas Shepard (the Young Avenger 'Speed') and Billy. 

Heinberg stated on the situation in a transcript with fans, "According to Billy's theory, the souls of Wanda's twins inhabited  his and Tommy's bodies when they were dispersed from Mephisto. But it's only a theory."  He also stated in another interview that his plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda, stating "If everything goes according to plan, Wanda will indeed return to Young Avengers early in Season Two, when Billy and Tommy embark on a search for the true source of their powers." .

Much conjecture has been made as to their appearance and powers. The theory that they are, indeed, Wanda's children is strongly supported in the comics by the Super-Skrull's statements and Vision's files. Billy believes himself to be Wanda's son. However, Tommy has been more skeptical about the situation. The official Marvel website however, lists Scarlet Witch and Vision as Wiccan's parents, with his "family" as his adopted parents, implying he and Tommy are biologically (or spiritually) still Wanda's sons.

Civil War.

In Marvel's 2006 crossover event Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda. They hope that revelation that her sons appear to be alive and well will aid in her recovery. However, their plan is disrupted by the attack by the Zodiac on the United Nations and the subsequent events of the Civil War.

S.H.I.E.L.D. arrests the Young Avengers. However, Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations.

Wiccan also takes part in the first major battle of the Civil War and was one of the first two casualties. Tony Stark and Peter Parker realize that the two rebels with teleportation powers needed to be incapacitated to prevent an escape from the ambush. So, Wiccan and Cloak are shot with tranquilizer darts and rendered unconscious. A violent battle ensues, by the end of which, Goliath lies dead. Most of the Anti-Registration group escapes, but Wiccan is left behind and captured by the Pro-Registration side. Billy and the other imprisoned anti-Registration heroes are eventually freed in a raid led by Captain America. This liberation is made possible largely by Teddy's shape-shifting ability, which allows him to mimic Hank Pym's retinal and voice patterns, and thereby release all the prisoners from their cells. 

Wiccan also plays a major role in the side-story Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways, which apparently takes place between the 2nd and 3rd issues of the main Civil War narrative. The Runaways try to stay out of the conflict, but they barely manage to escape from the government forces. Hearing of this development in the news, the Young Avengers decide to help the Runaways even though Captain America vetoes the plan. Wiccan uses his magic to locate and teleport to the Runaways. However, the Runaways believe that the Young Avengers have come to capture them and a fight ensues until Eli (Patriot) succeeds in convincing Nico to stop the hostilities. The two teams are later attacked by Noh-Varr, who captures Wiccan and Hulkling, and (apparently) kills the Runaway Xavin. The young heroes become the prisoners of the Warden, who proceeds to practice vivisection on the unconscious Teddy. This has little physical effect on Hulkling, whose vital organs keep shifting out of the way of the Warden's knife, but it does have a strong psychological effect on Billy, who cries out, "I want you to die." (He is subsequently very grieved that he has been manipulated into so much hatred.) The boys are rescued by Xavin, whose Skrull physiology allowed him to recover from Noh-Varr's attack. He comes close to killing the Warden, but Teddy stops him from becoming a murderer.

Relationships.
Exchanges between Wiccan and Hulkling had led some readers to speculate that the two young men had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship.  Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue #12, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly.

In #6, Kate advises that Asgardian should change his codename to avoid the obvious puns when the press discovers that he's in a relationship with Hulkling, implying that the others already know the two are gay.

In Young Avengers Special, the team agrees to give an interview to Kat Farrell, and Jessica Jones warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true.  After some deliberation, the two decide to tell her, with Teddy adding, "Why should Northstar have all the fun?"

Powers and abilities.  
As Wiccan, Billy Kaplan possesses a spellcasting talent that may or may not be related to a reality warping power. While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning based spells. By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down forcefields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, and telekinetic force beams.

It was revealed in Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways that Billy must be able to hear his spells for them to be successful.

Trivia.
Allan Heinberg has stated that Billy and his family are Reform Jews. ;
Asked about Billy's codename, Heinberg said "It turns out that code names are the trickiest part of creating new characters. When Kate suggests 'Wiccan' to Billy in Young Avengers #6, she, like me, was not thinking in terms of the specific religious practice of Wicca, but rather attempting to find a suitable counterpart for the word 'witch.' It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone with 'Wiccan.' And since adopting the code name, rest assured Billy has been doing his Wiccan homework, so keep reading..."  ;

<doc id="3493687" title="Lazy Sunday" nonfiltered="616" processed="611" dbindex="450621">



Lazy Sunday is a music video starring Saturday Night Live cast members Chris Parnell and Andy Samberg that aired on the December 17, 2005, episode of the show. It was the second SNL Digital Short to be aired.

The film paired Parnell, an eight-year veteran of SNL who had performed rap several times during Weekend Update, and  Samberg, a first-year featured player with little screen time.

After the film aired, it was available for free download on iTunes. Additionally, it was posted to several Web sites and shared via e-mail. The film was viewed more than five million times at YouTube before NBC Universal asked the site to remove it, along with several other copyrighted NBC video clips, in February 2006.  NBC later placed the short on its SNL site, although it's labeled "The Chronicles of Narnia". In late 2006, the short reappeared on YouTube and remained online for the rest of the year, but was pulled in mid-January 2007.

Making of the film.
Samberg's fellow members of The Lonely Island were involved in the making of the film. Akiva Schaffer directed the clip and Jorma Taccone created the musical beat. All three plus Parnell wrote the script on December 12, 2005, and the music was recorded the following day. On December 15, a crew filmed the short in about five hours using the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in the Chelsea district of Manhattan as a stand-in for a movie theater. Taccone's girlfriend's sister appears as a convenience store clerk.

Samberg thought audiences would criticize its low-budget style, cheesy lyrics, and product placements, but Internet prevalence and continued downloads suggest it has gained popularity on par with More Cowbell, a 2000 SNL skit starring Christopher Walken.

Samberg, Taccone, Schaffer and Parnell put an original copy of the Lazy Sunday lyrics, with two deleted verses, up for sale, with the proceeds going to a charity for animal shelters. It was put on eBay and sold for $4300.00.

References in the song.

 "I love those cupcakes like McAdams loves Gosling"   A reference to Hollywood couple Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling and their on-screen romance during 2004's The Notebook.
 "The Chronic - what? - cles of Narnia"  "Chronic" or "the chronic" is slang for potent cannabis and is also the name of Dr. Dre's highly influential solo debut. What? is a common shout-out among such rappers as Lil Jon and DMX. The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels written by C. S. Lewis, with a recent movie based on them.
"Google Maps is the best" Samberg believes Google's popular mapping service to be better than rivals Yahoo! Maps or Mapquest.  The tagline, "Double True", appears on screen in a font and multi-color combination reminiscent of Google's logo.

 "Girl acted like she never seen a ten befo'/It's all about the Hamiltons, baby" "Hamiltons" are U.S. ten-dollar bills, so called because they contain a portrait of Alexander Hamilton. Common rap slang has dubbed hundred-dollar bills "Benjamins" for similar reasons (they contain a portrait of Benjamin Franklin); the line is a reference to Puff Daddy's "It's All about the Benjamins."  ;
 "I'm ghost like Swayze"  A reference to the 1990's Ghost, starring Patrick Swayze. "Swayze" has been a rap synonym for "disappear," popularized by EPMD during the film's initial popularity.  Ghost is another prototypical "chick flick".
 "You can call us Aaron Burr from the way we're dropping Hamiltons"   This refers to the 1804 duel in which then Vice President Burr killed Alexander Hamilton.

In the Domino's Pizza Brooklyn Pizza commercial, during the description and price of the pizza, a sound loop of Lazy Sunday can be heard.
In an episode of The Office called "The Merger", Michael makes an orientation film called "Lazy Scranton" for the Stamford employees who were transferred to Scranton. Starring Michael and Dwight, the video uses the same music, rap style, and camera effects used in the "Lazy Sunday" video. In another episode, Kelly describes the video to Michael while waiting for a pretzel.
In the film Epic Movie, a character called Captain Jack Swallows (A Reference to Jack Sparrow from the Pirates Of The Carribbean franchise) breaks out in a rap called 'Lazy Pirate Day', and the song is reminiscent of 'Lazy Sunday' both visually and sonically. Swallows is played by Darrell Hammond, who is a long-time performer on Saturday Night Live.

Responses.

Widespread Internet distribution of Lazy Sunday spawned many spoofs and imitations, including:

Lazy Monday, a West Coast replyA West Coast response video, a dated reference to the mid-1990s East Coast/West Coast hip-hop rivalry. In Lazy Monday, comedians Mark Feuerstein, Sam Friedlander, and Adam Stein go to "Color Me Mine", a do-it-yourself pottery shop, get stuck in traffic on the 405 freeway, and get a macchiato at the Coffee Bean. The repeated chant of "Color", which resolves to "Color Me Mine", is a reference to Ice T's Colors.
Lazy Muncie, a Mid West reply.* Lazy Muncie soon followed, in which two fishing buddies espouse the virtues of their midwestern town, home to Bob Evans's delicious biscuits and gravy, Elks Lodge dances, and hometown heroes such as comedian David Letterman and a cameo appearance by Garfield creator Jim Davis.
 Parody duo Lyric Intensive created a video about their Academy Awards party preparations called "Oscar Sunday", which references Saved by the Bell and EZ Pass in the process. ;
Lazy Sunday UK, (a.k.a. We Drink Tea), the UK response, We Drink Tea, soon followed, discussing the ups and downs of life in Britain, including references to Harry Potter, Snakes on a Plane and, of course, drinking tea: .
 A version was stitched together from humorously-subtitled video clips of Osama bin Laden and another jihadist speaking in Arabic. This is the so-called "Middle East coast" edition. ;
 A high school Christian organization, Young Life, joined the mix with a spoof in which two leaders rap about hanging out with teenagers at the local high school.  Lazy Wednesday contains jokes common to the organization, and became popular with Young Life groups around the country. Another Christian-themed response was released under the title "Easter Sunday".
 The Dirty South joined the battle with their response, Sunday in which two married men claim they "got the lock on how to kick Sunday": Washing their Volvo wagons, dropping donations off at Goodwill, and picking up Kotex for their wives.
 The UK based Dotcartoon responded with a cartoon version of "Lazy Sunday" in the Second Episode of "Solutions Are Not The Answer";
 Two American soldiers deployed in Iraq, both originally from Muncie, Indiana made a response to "Lazy Muncie", entitled Lazy Ramadi. In this version the soldiers rap about insurgents, body armor, and Jell-O from the mess hall. ;
 Ultimate players also followed with the parody "Tourney Sunday" written by Dave Emme and Ryan Tibshirani.  Tourney Sunday includes one-liners referencing throws, bagels, foot-blocks and the use of port-o-potties at ultimate tournaments.
 A Jewish response called http://tzvee.blogspot.com/2006/06/aaron-kotlers-music-video.html "Lazy Shabbos"]. ;
 There is now an Australian version of Lazy Sunday entitled "Lazy Lawn Bowls" where the Aussies "be rapping like 8 mile if not for the metric system!". Set in Sydney, features original lyrics, video and soundtrack and of course an obligatory Russell Crowe reference.
 Another Canadian Response titled "Crazy Monday", In this version, two guys rap about organic foods and perogis.
 The Chicago response, titled "Wicked Wednesday" by Mark Sansone and Matt Cunningham has original music, and includes references to the Bachrach clothing company, the El (Chicago's rapid transit system), Al's Beef, Portillo's, and Mr. Beef, Marshall Fields, and of course, the Oriental Palace theater and the musical Wicked.  This was featured on the "Steve and Joey Show", and the nationally broadcast WGN Morning News.  On July 27th, the boys performed the rap live on the "WGN Morning News".
 Another response called "Lazy Tuesday"  features two white guys rapping about their love for Kentucky Basketball. See the Lazy Tuesday page.
From Snellville, Georgia, where "Everybody's Somebody" came. In this response to Lazy Sunday, "T-dubbs" and "Ropes Dogg" (thanks to Dye Vers Productions) rap about the wonders of Snellville, including the 19 Waffle Houses, Diana Degarmo, and Highway 78.

<doc id="285640" title="Defensive marketing warfare strategies" nonfiltered="620" processed="615" dbindex="450625">
In marketing and strategic management, marketing warfare strategies are a type of marketing strategy that uses military metaphor to craft a businesses strategy. See marketing warfare strategies for background and an overview.  Defensive marketing warfare strategies are a type of marketing warfare strategy designed to protect a company's market share, profitability, product positioning, or mind share. 

Fundamental principles.
There are five fundamental principles involved:
Always counter an attack with equal or greater force. ;
Defend every important market.
Be forever vigilant in scanning for potential attackers. Assess the strength of the competitor. Consider the amount of support that the attacker might muster from allies.
The best defense is to attack yourself. Attack your weak spots and rebuild yourself anew.
 Defensive strategies should be the exclusive domain of the market leader.
Types of defensive strategies.
The main types of defensive marketing warfare strategies are:
Position defense - This involves the defense of a fortified position. This tends to be a weak defense because you become a  sitting duck . It can lead to a siege situation in which time is on the side of the attacker, that is, as time goes by the defender gets weaker, while the attacker gets stronger. In a business context, this involves setting up fortifications such as barriers to market entry around a product, brand, product line, market, or market segment. This could include increasing brand equity, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, or repeat purchase rate. It could also include exclusive distribution contracts, patent protection, market monopoly, or government protected monopoly status. It is best used in homogeneous markets where the defender has dominant market position and potential attackers have very limited resources.  ;
Mobile defense - This involves constantly shifting resources and developing new strategies and tactics. A mobile defense is intended to create a moving target that is hard to successfully attack, while simultaneously, equipping the defender with a flexible response mechanism should an attack occur. In business this would entail introducing new products, introducing replacement products,  modifying existing products, changing market segments, changing target markets, repositioning products, or changing promotional focus. This defense requires a very flexible organization with strong marketing, entrepreneurial, product development, and marketing research skills.  ;
Flank position - This involves the re-deployment of your resources to deter a flanking attack.   You protect against potential loss of market share in a segment, by strengthening your competitive position in this segment with new products and other tactics. (see flanking marketing warfare strategies) ;
Counter offensive - This involves countering an attack with an offense of your own. If you are attacked, retaliate with an attack on the aggressor s weakest point. ;

<doc id="3320563" title="Cocos Islands Mutiny" nonfiltered="626" processed="621" dbindex="450631">


The Cocos Islands Mutiny was a failed mutiny by Sri Lankan servicemen on the then-British Cocos (Keeling) Islands in May 1942 during the Second World War.

The mutineers were to seize control of the islands, disable the British garrison and to transfer the islands to the Empire of Japan.  However, the mutiny was defeated after the Sri Lankans failed to seize control of the islands.  Many mutineers were punished, and the three ringleaders were executed; they were the only Commonwealth servicemen to be executed for mutiny during the Second World War.

 Background .
Units belonging to the Ceylon Defence Force (CDF), including the Ceylon Garrison Artillery (CGA), the Ceylon Light Infantry (CLI) and the Ceylon Volunteer Medical corps, were mobilised on 2 September, the day before Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The CGA was equipped with six-inch (152 mm) and nine-inch (227 mm) guns. Several of them were posted to the Seychelles and the Cocos Islands, accompanied by contingents of the CLI and the Medical Corps.

The fall of Singapore and the subsequent sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse, punctured forever the myth of British invincibility. Whatever remained was ripped to tatters by the sinking of the aircraft carrier Hermes and the cruisers Cornwall and Dorsetshire off Sri Lanka in early April 1942; accompanied at the same time by the virtually unopposed bombing of the island and bombardment of Madras.

The feelings of the Sri Lankan troops had been excited by the work carried out by the pro-independence Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), both before and during the war. They had volunteered to fight the racism of the fascists and had found institutionalised racism in their own regiments. Even the Burghers, who were of European ancestry, found themselves discriminated against. 

With the Japanese  successes, public sentiment on Ceylon turned in favour of the Japanese; being unaware of the fate that befell Japan's East Asian conquest, many Sri Lankans thought that the Japanese would serve as liberators. At this time J.R. Jayawardene, later to be President of Sri Lanka, held discussions with the Japanese with this aim in mind.

 Mutiny .
Indian troops, who made up the majority of the garrison on Christmas Island, rose up against the British troops and killed them in March 1942, before surrendering to the invading Japanese.

The Ceylon Garrison Artillery on Horsburgh Island in the Cocos Islands mutinied on the night of 8/9 May, intending to hand the islands over to the Japanese. The plan was to arrest Captain Gardiner, the British Battery Commanding Officer and his second-in-command, to disarm the troops loyal to the British Empire, to turn the 6-inch guns on the CLI troops on Direction Island, and to signal the Japanese on Christmas Island. However, the soldiers all proved to be poor shots with small arms - one soldier was killed and another wounded. The rebels' one Bren gun jammed at a crucial moment, when Gratien Fernando, the leader of the mutiny, had it trained on Gardiner. The rebels then attempted to turn the 6-inch guns on Direction Island, but were overpowered.  

Messages sent by Fernando were received in  Sri Lanka, indicating that there was co-operation between him and the both CLI troops and the Australian signallers on Direction Island. He declared he had surrendered on condition that he would be tried in Colombo - it may be that he intended to give a speech from the dock to inspire his compatriots. However, the rebels were court martialled on the Cocos Islands.

Fernando was defiant to the end, confidently believing that he would be remembered as a patriot, and refused a commutation of punishment. He was executed on 5 August 1942 at Welikada Prison, and two other mutineers shortly thereafter. Fernando's last words were "Loyalty to a country under the heel of a white man is disloyalty".

 Consequences .
No Sri Lankan combat regiment was deployed by the British in a combat situation after the Cocos Islands Mutiny. The defences of Sri Lanka were beefed up to three British army divisions because the island was strategically important, holding almost all the British Empire's resources of rubber. Rationing was instituted so that Sri Lankans were comparatively better fed than their Indian neighbours, in order to prevent disaffection among the natives.

The LSSP's anti-colonial agitation now included references to the Cocos Islands Mutiny. Public disgust at British colonial rule continued to grow. Sir Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke, the Civil Defence Commissioner complained that the British commander of Ceylon, Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton called him a 'black bastard'.

Sri Lankans in Singapore and Malaysia formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the Indian National Army, directly under Subhas Chandra Bose. A plan was made to transport them to Sri Lanka by submarine, to lead a liberation struggle there, but this was aborted.

 Mutineers .
The men who were convicted by court martial of mutiny were:
 Bdr Gratien Fernando - Death (Executed on 5 August 1942);
 Gnr Carlo Augustus Gauder - Death (Executed on 7 August 1942);
 Gnr G Benny de Silva - Death (Executed on 8 August 1942);
 Gnr R S Hamilton - Death (Commuted to penal servitude for three years);

<doc id="1075033" title="Discreet Music" nonfiltered="627" processed="622" dbindex="450632">

Discreet Music (1975) is an album by the British ambient musician Brian Eno. While No Pussyfooting may be his first ambient album and Another Green World features many ambient pieces, this is Brian Eno s first purely ambient solo album. It is also the first "Brian Eno" album, as opposed to his previous rock albums released under the name "Eno".

Brian Eno s concept of ambient music builds upon a concept composer Erik Satie called "furniture music". This means music that is intended to blend into the ambient atmosphere of the room rather than directly focused upon.

The inspiration for this album began when Eno was left bed-ridden by an accident and was given an album of eighteenth century harp music. After struggling to put the record on the turntable and returning to bed, he realized that it was turned down toward the threshold of inaudibility and he lacked the strength to turn it up. Eno said this experience taught him a new way to perceive music.

This album is also an experiment in algorithmic, generative composition. His intention was to explore multiple ways to create music with limited planning or intervention.

The a-side of the album is a thirty minute piece titled "Discreet Music". It was originally intended as a background for Robert Fripp to play against in a series of concerts.

The liner notes contain a diagram of how this piece was created. It begins with two melodic phrases of different lengths played back from a synthesizer's digital recall system. This signal is then run through a graphic equalizer to occasionally change its timbre. It is then run through an echo unit before being recorded onto a tape machine. The tape runs to the take-up reel of a second machine. The output of that machine is fed back into the first tape machine which records the overlapped signals.

The second half of the album is three pieces collectively titled "Three Variations on the Canon in D Major by Johann Pachelbel". These pieces were performed by The Cockpit Ensemble, conducted and co-arranged by Gavin Bryars. The members of the ensemble were each given brief excerpts from the score, which were repeated several times, along with instructions to gradually alter the tempo and other elements of the composition. The titles of these pieces were derived from inaccurate French-to-English translations of the liner notes of a version Pachelbel s Canon performed by the orchestra of Jean Francois Pillard.

In "Fullness of Wind" the tempo decreases relative to the pitch of the instrument. The violins have the fastest rate of decay while the basses have the slowest. This piece features effects and processing by Brian Eno.

In "French Catalogues" notes and melodies of similar tempos are gathered into blocks from different parts of the score.

In "Brutal Ardour" each performer plays a sequence of notes of a different duration, so the original composition eventually breaks down into chaos.

This album was also released on the Virgin label. On this reissue, a full minute of silence separates "Discreet Music's" title track from the Pachelbel piece.

A brief excerpt of "Discreet Music" was featured on Fripp & Eno s Evening Star, which was released before this album.

Herbert Hudson Taylor (April 3, 1861   June 6,1950), British Protestant Christian missionary to China, author, speaker and eldest son of James Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission and Maria Jane Dyer. He served there for over 50 years   the last three as one of the prisoners of the Japanese at the Weifang internment camp during World War II along with Eric Liddell and 1500 others.

Herbert Taylor was four when his father founded the China Inland Mission. He had been born in London during his parents  first furlough in England together. At the time of his birth, they were living with his aunt and uncle Amelia and Benjamin Broomhall at 63 Westbourne Grove, in Bayswater. In 1866 at the age of five Herbert and his parents, three siblings  and sixteen other missionaries sailed to China aboard the Lammermuir (clipper) as part of the famous Lammermuir Party. During the four-month long voyage the ship was nearly wrecked by two typhoons.

On arrival in China, the family adopted Chinese clothing and food and set off to find a place to establish a mission cente in Zhejiang. On the way, Herbert almost drowned when he fell overboard into the Grand Canal of China during their travels. Another scare happened shortly afterward when he was bitten by a dog on the face. His sister, Grace Dyer Taylor died of meningitis near Hangzhou within the first year. When he was six the family was nearly killed by a rioting mob in Yangzhou in 1868. Finally in 1870 he was sent home with his surviving siblings with Emily Blatchley to live in London, separated from his parents. His mother died in China soon after they arrived home.

Like his father, he enrolled in the Royal London Hospital medical college. After two years he decided to return to China to become one of the charter teachers at the newly founded China Inland Mission Chefoo School at (Yantai). After marrying a fellow missionary, Jeanie Gray, they endured tumultuous years in China, including the Boxer Rebellion, the fall of the Qing dynasty, the Warlord era, and the Sino-Japanese War (1937).

In 1930 the China Inland Mission published  Ren Ch'eng-Yüan, A Tamarisk Garden Blessed with Rain. Or the Autobiography of Pastor Ren. Translated and edited by Herbert Hudson Taylor & Marshall Broomhall .

At the age of 80 he was interned by the Japanese at the Weihsien or Weifang concentration camp after Japan had entered the war in 1941. Everyone at Weifang were liberated in 1945 by American paratroopers.

Descendants of Herbert Hudson Taylor continue his full-time ministry today in the communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Grandson, Rev.  James Hudson Taylor III  and  his son  Rev. James Hudson Taylor IV are now based in Hong Kong.
Another of Herbert Taylor s grandchildren is Mary Previte who served in the New Jersey General Assembly representing the 6th legislative district from 1998 to 2006.

Uptown in Manhattan, New York City, refers to the northern part of Manhattan; generally speaking, north of 59th Street.  In Manhattan, particularly when one is in roughly the southern half of the borough, it can also mean "north" or "northbound," as in "I'm going uptown."  Although geographically accurate, the names "Upper Manhattan" or "Northern Manhattan" are less commonly used. This is may largely be the result of the term having a distinct socio-economic connotation refering to Manhattans affluent Upper West and Upper East Side.

Uptown includes such neighborhoods as Harlem, Spanish Harlem, Washington Heights, Hudson Heights, Manhattan Valley, Manhattanville, Morningside Heights, Marble Hill, and Inwood.

<doc id="1716404" title="Roman de Fauvel" nonfiltered="635" processed="630" dbindex="450640">
The Roman de Fauvel, translated as The Story of the Fawn-Colored Beast, is a 14th century French poem accredited to French royal clerk Gervais du Bus, though probably best known for its musical arrangement by Philippe de Vitry in the Ars Nova style.  First published in Paris in 1314, the piece serves as an allegorical criticism of church and state, using the metaphor of a donkey becoming the ruler of his master's house upon a kind whim from Dame Fortune.  The poem, though banned at the time for being seditious and heretical, was wildly successful and still copied into the 15th century. Twelve manuscripts have survived, many of which are in remarkbably good condition, owing to the fact that they were stowed away securely due to their illegality.

Following in the literary tradition of the thirteenth century, the Roman de Fauvel is often compared with the Roman de la Rose.  

The Roman de Fauvel is laden with allegories and political satire. The donkey's name, which when broken down forms fau-vel, or "veiled lie", also forms an acrostic in which each letter stands for one of the seven deadly sins: Flaterie (Flattery), Avarice (Greed), Vilanie (Guile), Variété (Inconstancy), Envie (Envy), and Lacheté (Cowardice).

Plot.

Fauvel, an ambitious but foolish donkey, decides that he is unsatisfied with his residence in the stable and moves into the largest room of his master's house.  Upon moving there, he changes it to suit his needs and has a custom hayrack built. Dame Fortune, the goddess of Fate, smiles upon Fauvel and appoints him leader of the house.  Subsequently, Church and secular leaders from many places make pilgrimages to see him, and bow to him in servitude, symbolizing Church and state rulers quickly bowing to Sin and corruption.  

Upon receiving Dame Fortune's smile, Fauvel travels to Macrocosmos and asks for her hand in marriage.  She denies him, but in her stead she proposes he wed Lady Vainglory.  Fauvel agrees, and the wedding takes place, with such guests present as Flirtation, Adultery, Carnal Lust, and Venus, in a technique similar to that of the Morality plays of the 15'th and 16'th centuries.

Finally, Dame Fortune reveals that Fauvel's role in the world is to give birth to more iniquitious rulers like himself, and to be the follower of the Antichrist, eventually to bring about the end of the world.

Music.
The musical accompaniment to Roman, mostly composed by Philippe de Vitry, is usually cited as the beginning of the Ars Nova movement.  Though most of the pieces are based on plainchant, they vary greatly in terms of ornamentation and layering, with some being entirely monophonic, and other, more complex pieces being polyphonic and even sung in multiple languages.  However the unifying characteristic of Roman is the use of the Isorhythm, which is a rhythmic pattern present in various voices of the piece at various times, though through the relative length of the isorhythm and its envolopment in the rest of the music, it is usually indiscernable to those not intimately familiar with the music.  
Literary and music critics have often claimed that the musical interpolations were chosen entirely randomly (Paris, 1898; Langfors, 1914; Gagnepain, 1996). However, more recent work has attempted to disprove this hypothesis, showing that the additions contributed by the BN146 are part to a larger artistic project with, beyond the political message, a religious purpose (Herbelot, 1998). Interestingly, the idea that this manuscript was more than an anthology was proposed back in 1935 by Emilie Dankh who gave us then a complete edition of the text of the BN146.

Although the text of the Roman de Fauvel is not particularly well known, the music has been frequently performed and recorded. The question of how the entire work would have been read or staged in the 14th century is the subject of academic debate. Some have suggested that BN146, the copy with additional 3000 verses and 169 musical pieces, could have been intended as a theatrical performance (Dankh, Herbelot). This hypothesis is of course in contradiction with the concurrent opinion that the Roman de Fauvel is mainly an anthology (Gagnepain).


Surviving copies.
The copy designated BN146 is attributed to Chaillou de Pesstain. Its particular value resides in the additional 3000 verses and 169 musical pieces which constitute a veritable anthology of thirteenth and early fourteenth century music (this includes Latin and French liturgical and devotional, sacred and profane, monophonic and polyphonic, chant, old and new music). The BN146 has often been said to mark the beginning of the stylistic period Ars Nova.

Trivia.
The English expression "to curry Fauvel", (now to "curry favor") arose from the scene in which potentates descended so low as to brush down the donkey and clean him off.

The Maysville Campus (formerly Maysville Community College) is located in Maysville, KY. Its original building is the 53,000 square-foot Administration Building constructed in 1969.  In 1983, the 16,231 square-foot Denham Wing was added.  The third building added to the campus was the 31,314 square-foot Calvert Student Center that was completed in 1992 and is connected to the Denham Wing.  In 2002, the 45,000 square-foot Technical Center became the fourth and newest building on campus. 

Rowan Campus.

The Rowan Campus (formerly Rowan Technical College) is located five miles north of Morehead, KY, on Kentucky Highway 32 on a seven-acre tract of land adjacent to the Rowan County Senior High School. 

Licking Valley Campus.

The Licking Valley Campus opened in Cynthiana, KY in 1989. In Fall 2002, the Licking Valley Campus (LVC) moved from a leased facility to its new 19,000 square-foot building in Cynthiana.  Its proximity to the high school and area technology center makes it an ideal location both for adults and for high school students who wish to take college-level courses.

The "Sonderbund"   as it is normally called; its complete name being Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und Künstler (the "Separate League of West German Art Lovers and Artists")   was a "special union" of artists and art lovers, established 1909 in Düsseldorf and dissolved in 1916. In its first years, the Sonderbund mounted some landmark exhibitions, successfully introducing French Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Modern Art to the western parts of Germany.

The international movement of Secessionism, which since 1890 began to cover the European art scene, entered Düsseldorf, its renowned art school and artist societies at a very late date. In 1908, a group of younger artists first organized a "special exhibition" ("Sonderausstellung"), the year following they reunited in a "Sonderbund" exhibition works of their own with French contemporary art lent by local collectors and the Galerie Bernheim Jeune of Paris. Encouraged by museum professionals, in August 1909 the Sonderbund was officially established.

The lasting fame of the "Sonderbund" is founded on its three "International Art Exhibitions", 1910 and 1911 in Düsseldorf, 1912 in Cologne, and especially on the latter exhibition, which supplied a breathtaking review of early modern art: Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso and the neo-impressionists Cross and Paul Signac, the first generation was set in context to more recent efforts all around Europe, with a special focus on Edvard Munch.

The organizers of the 1913 Armory Show were highly impressed by the exhibition in Cologne, and thus first rate European art soon made its way to the United States.

<doc id="6908480" title="The Mysteries of Pittsburgh (film)" nonfiltered="640" processed="635" dbindex="450645">

 

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a film adaptation of Michael Chabon's best-selling novel of the same name, which was published in 1988.  The screenplay was written by Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also directed.  Shooting in Pittsburgh ended in October 2006, with the film set for release in 2007.

History.

An earlier attempt to bring Pittsburgh to the big screen failed.  In early 2000, independent filmmaker Jon Sherman (writer and director of 1996's Breathing Room) adapted Chabon's novel into a screenplay, hoping to film it with Jason Schwartzman in the role of Art Bechstein.  By August of the same year, Chabon announced that the project had fallen apart, sadly writing, "Ah, well. Maybe someday."

Controversy.

Cast member Sienna Miller created a minor stir in Pittsburgh when, in a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone, she referred to the city as "Shitsburgh", saying, "Can you believe this is my life? Will you pity me when you're back in your funky New York apartment and I'm still in Pittsburgh? I need to get more glamorous films and stop with my indie year."

Miller has been parodied in Pittsburgh media (including one article that was headlined "Semi-famous actress dumps on the 'Burgh") and criticized for making what was seen as an unnecessarily disparaging remark, given the special treatment the film cast and crew had been given by the visitor's bureau and other city offices.

The Winfield Cup was an Australian rugby league trophy awarded to the winner of the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) Grand Final from 1982 to 1994, and to the winner of the Australian Rugby League (ARL) Grand Final in 1995.

The trophy was abolished after the 1995 season when cigarette manufacturer Winfield was forced to withdraw their sponsorship of the NSWRL Premiership, following the Australian Federal Government's introduction of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 which outlawed tobacco advertising in sports in Australia.  Winfield were not the first tobacco company to sponsor the NSWRL Premiership, however; from 1960 to 1981, the trophy given to the Grand Final winners was sponsored by W.D. & H.O. Wills.

A redesigned ARL Premiership trophy, known as the Optus Cup, was introduced in 1996 but lasted just two seasons.

The Gladiators.
The Winfield Cup trophy was a three-dimensional bronze cast of a famous photo called The Gladiators, which depicted a mud-soaked Norm Provan of St. George and Arthur Summons of Western Suburbs embracing after the 1963 Grand Final.  This image became symbolic of the camaraderie and 'mateship' in rugby league and the present-day National Rugby League Premiership Trophy (which evolved from the Winfield Cup) uses a similar design.

"Pilot" is episode 1 of season 1 of the FOX network serialized kidnapping drama Vanished.

Plot synopsis.
Sara Collins is on the phone with an unnamed person when her husband, Senator Jeffrey Collins walks in.  She instructs the caller never to call again.  Her husband gives her a present--a diamond necklace.  Later at a benefit honoring Sara's work with the Begin Right educational charity, Sara is presented with a necklace made for her by one of her students; she removes her diamond one to wear it. She then leaves to take an urgent phone call.  

Meanwhile, at the party, Jeffrey is pressured by the Deputy Attorney General who wants his vote for the President's choice for Supreme Court. Suddenly, Jeffrey is notified that Sara is missing.  Jeffrey alerts security and runs to the front door where outside he finds the homemade necklace that Sara was wearing.

1 year earlier:
A flashback details FBI Agent Graham Kelton's failed rescue attempt of 12 year-old "Nathan".  As Agent Kelton delivers the ransom money to the suspect, a sharpshooter takes out the man. A detonator switch in the kidnapper's hand goes off, and Nathan dies when the explosives strapped to him are detonated.  

Present Day:
Agent Kelton is notified that Senator Collins' wife might be kidnapped.

WCN reporter Judy Nash stops intimate activity with her cameraman, Adam, when she sees a report that Sara Collins is missing. Judy calls her boss and asks to be put on the story.

Kelton arrives at the hotel and takes over from his partner Agent Lin Mei. Kelton asks Jefferey whether or not he or his wife were having affairs. Collins' son Max tells Kelton that the man that took Sara touched her chair. Kelton has prints lifted from the chair while Mei tells Jeffrey that his daughter Marcy might be missing too.

Marcy is awakened by her boyfriend Ben at his house; they plan to elope.  The FBI raid Ben's house, suspecting that Marcy is also kidnapped.  They think that Ben is kidnapping her.  Marcy goes outside to see her father and awkwardly introduces him to Ben. Jeffery tells her that Sara is missing; in the background Judy begins her new report.

Max tells Kelton that Marcy and Sara haven't been getting along for the past year. Mei finds a positive pregnacy test in Sara's bathroom, and Kelton gives the news to Jeffery. 

Mei and Kelton attempt to trace Sara's wheareabouts during the day.  Earlier, she had a meeting in a cafe with who we later discover is Senator Collin's ex-wife.  

Sara's parents come in and tell the agents that it's not possible for Sara to get pregnant.

The police track down the car of the man suspected to have kidnapped Sara. The driver, however is not their suspect--he is a man in the act of stealing the car.  Unbeknownst to the man, inside the trunk the suspect was dead. The medical examiner tells the FBI team that the suspect died within an hour after taking Sara from the hotel. There is also a 9 tattooed on his hand; which was done after he was killed.

The next day Judy finds out that a missing persons report was filed on Sara 12 years ago, but she is unable to find more information.  Later, Judy finds Sara's parents and asks them about the missing persons report from 12 years ago. They tell her about an urgent message they received from Sara about Jeffrey but she disappeared before they could talk.

The next day, Marcy goes to Ben's house. He isn't home, and while she waits for him, she finds a blood soaked sweatshirt and a bag full of cash hidden by the washing machine. 

The FBI realizes that the gun that killed Sara's kidnapper is somewhat rare, and they are able to track the few people to whom such a gun is registered. They raid the likely house of the owner of the gun, and find the dead body of an Atlanta mayor's wife,  missing 10 years.  She is still pink, and they realize that her body had been frozen after she was killed.  She holds a prayer card with St. Nathan on it. On the back "9:29" is written on it; Nathan is the name of the boy that agent Kelton couldn't save 6 months earlier.

Marcy sneaks out of Ben's house with the money and the sweatshirt. Max sends an email to his mother warning her that his father and the FBI know she's in town.

Across the country a man named Peter Manning is watching TV in a bar. There's a news report about the missing Sara Collins. He realizes that he knows her. He tells his friend that he used to date her but her name was Nikki Johnson at the time. He asked her to marry him but she disappeared--it was 12 years ago.
(Recap based on  with substantial edits and changes)

Arc significance.

 The mystery is set up and the main characters are introduced;

 The first clues of a broader conspiracy are laid--the number 9 tattooed on the hand of the suspected kidnapper, the prayer card with St. Nathan, the number 9:29.  Repeated mention of a senate confirmation hearing is made, and a previous kidnapping is referenced.

On the Kochertalbrücke (literal translation Kocher Valley Bridge) near Schwäbisch Hall the Autobahn 6 crosses the Kocher valley between Heilbronn and Nuremberg. With its maximum height of 185m above the valley ground it is the highest viaduct in Germany, and the pillar height of 178m is second to only the Viaduc de Millau in France.

The nine spans of this prestressed concrete girder bridge cover a length of 1128m, the individual span lengths being 81m for the outer two and 138m for the remaining seven. Pillar height varies from 40m to 178m. The bridge table is 31m wide. Construction was from 1976 to 1979.

A museum in the village of Geislingen am Kocher below the bridge (visits by prior appointment) not only tells the bridge story but also displays dinosaur fossils found 
during the construction of the motorway.

The Idaho Center is a complex of entertainment venues in Nampa, Idaho, near Boise. 

Venues include a 10,500-seat amphitheater which was built in 1998 and features a 60-by-40-foot stage; a 12,279-seat arena featuring 31,200 square feet of arena floor space; the Idaho Horse Park, used for horse shows; and the Sports Center, used for track and field events including the home meets of the Boise State University Broncos track teams.

The Idaho Center arena is best known for hosting the Snake River Stampede Rodeo during the third week of July every year. The Snake River Stampede is considered one of the nation's top rodeos. 

The arena is the former home of the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association and the Idaho Stallions of the now defunct Indoor Professional Football League and is used for concerts; trade shows, sporting events, and other events. 

The Idaho Center arena is the former home of the NAIA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament. Upon its completion, the tournament moved to the Idaho Center in 1998 from its former home on the campus of Northwest Nazarene University (then known as Northwest Nazarene College). The tournament left town in 2000 when NNC became a University and left the NAIA to become an NCAA Division II School. 

In March 2003, the Idaho Center arena played home for the Boise State University men's basketball second round matchup in the NIT against the UWM Panthers. The game was moved to the Idaho Center due to a prior scheduled Metallica concert at Boise State's Taco Bell Arena. The game drew a crowd of more than 10,000, making it the largest crowd to see a basketball game in the arena's history.

North Nampa Urban Renewal Agency.
In Nampa, the historic downtown was neglected for new and bigger stores on the outskirts of town and the North Nampa residential area became a place for lower income residents. The homes became neglected and crime rose in the area. To help combat this effect, the Nampa City Council created the North Nampa Urban Renewal Agency in 1994. As part of their urban renewal plan, the North Nampa Urban Renewal Agency gave interest-free loans to property owners to repair or replace their homes (improve their property).

NNURA members thought the idea of a convention center would invigorate the stagnant North Nampa. Property was purchased several miles from the targeted area to be improved and the Idaho Center was born. In spite of the NNURA's continued funding of the Idaho Center, the facility lost money from 1996 to 2004. The NNURA contributed at least $9.6 million to the operation costs of the Idaho Center. In 2004, the North Nampa Urban Renewal Agency expired (after 10 years) and was not renewed by the Nampa City Council.

On November 14, 2006, the Idaho Center hosted the Rolling Stones, the first time the band had performed in Idaho.

Carole Kai is an entertainer and philanthropist from Hawaii.  She is best known for being the co-founder of the Great Aloha Run, one of the largest road races and charity benefits in Hawaii.

Born Carole Shimizu in Honolulu, Hawaii, she was a graduate of McKinley High School in Honolulu.  In the 1970s, she was one of the original members of the Hawaiian music group The Fabulous Krush.  Later, in the late 1990s, she and local singers Loyal Garner, Melveen Leed, and Nohelani Cypriano performed Hawaiian music as a group.  She was also co-host of the local TV show Hawaii Stars.

However, Kai is best known for her charitable work.  She was the organizer and namesake of the first bed race in Hawaii, the Carole Kai Bed Race (later the Honolulu International Bed Race).  It was an annual event benefiting the Variety Schools, a local school for children with special needs.  Later, in 1985, she and local cardiologist Jack Scaff came up with the idea of organizing a road race between Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu and Aloha Stadium.  This race became the Great Aloha Run, and it is now one of the largest road races in Hawaii, attracting about 20,000 runners annually.

Walter Polovchak (born 3 October 1967) is a Ukrainian-American who, as a child, became the center of the legal case Polovchak v. Meese after refusing to leave Chicago, Illinois and return to Ukraine in the Soviet Union with his parents when he was 12.

The case became a Cold War cause célèbre after the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) allowed him to stay against his parents' will. Polovchak and his 18-year-old sister Natalie went to live with a cousin during the dispute, and he received temporary political asylum. A sympathetic Reagan Administration helped drag out court procedures until Polovchak turned 18 and was no longer a minor.

Since becoming a U.S. citizen, Polovchak visits the now-independent Ukraine every second year on average, and has re-established relations with his parents.

The  Temminck s Lark  or Temminck s Horned Lark (Eremophila bilopha), breeds across much of north Africa, through northern Arabia to western Iraq. It is mainly resident, but some populations of this passerine bird are partially migratory, moving further south in winter. 

This lark is a bird of open stony semi-desert. Its nest is on the ground, with 2-4 eggs being laid. Its food is seeds supplemented with insects in the breeding season.

Unlike most other larks, Temminck s Lark is a distinctive looking species on the ground, similar to the other, larger, member of its genus, the Shore Lark. The 14-15 cm adult is mainly reddish brown-grey above and pale below, and it has a striking black and white face pattern. The summer male has black "horns", which give this species its alternative name. The juvenile of this species is reddish above and pale below, quite unlike juvenile Shore Lark.

Adult Temminck s Lark differs from Shore Lark in its reddish, rather than brown-grey plumage, and the lack of yellow in the face pattern. It has a similar but less harsh metallic call.

According to the Buddhist tradition, all phenomena (dharmas) are marked by three characteristics, sometimes referred to as the Dharma seals, that is dukkha (suffering), anicca (impermanence), and anatta (non-Self).

After much meditation, the Buddha concluded that everything in the physical world (plus everything in the phenomenology of psychology) is marked by these three characteristics:

 Dukkha (Sanskrit duhkha) or unsatisfactoriness. Nothing found in the physical world or even the psychological realm can bring lasting deep satisfaction.
 Anicca (Sanskrit anitya) or impermanence. This refers not only to the fact that all conditioned things eventually cease to exist, but also that all conditioned things are in a constant state of flux. (Visualize a leaf growing on a tree.  It dies and falls off the tree but is soon replaced by a new leaf.);
 Anatta (Sanskrit anatman) impersonality, or non-Self. The human personality, "soul", or Self, is a conventional appellation applied to the assembly of physical and psychological components, each individually subject to constant flux; there is no central core (or essence); this is somewhat similar to a bundle theory of mind or soul.

There is often a fourth Dharma Seal mentioned:
 Nirvana is peace. Nirvana is the 'other shore' from Samsara.

Together the three characteristics of existence are called ti-lakkhana, in Pali; or tri-laksana, in Sanskrit.

By bringing the three (or four) seals into moment-to-moment experience through concentrated awareness, we are said to achieve Wisdom - the third of the three higher trainings - the way out of Samsara. In this way we can identify that, according to Sutra, the recipe (or formula) for leaving Samsara is achieved by a deep-rooted change to our Weltanschauung. 

 Dukkha .


 Whatever is impermanent is subject to change. Whatever is subject to change is subject to suffering.;
   The Buddha;

Striving for what we desire, we may experience stress and suffering   dukkha (P li; Sanskrit: du kha). Getting what we desired, we may find delight and happiness. Soon after, the novelty may wear out and we may get bored with it. Boredom is a form of dissatisfaction (or suffering) and to escape from it, we divert ourselves from such boredom by indulging in a pursuit of new forms of pleasure. Sometimes not willing to relinquish objects that we are already disinterested in, we start to collect and amass possessions instead of sharing with others who may have better use in it than we do. Boredom is a result of change. Change of our interest in that object of desire that so captivated us in the first place.

If we do not get bored already, then change may instead occur in the object of desire. Silverware may become tarnished, a new dress worn thin or a gadget gone obsolete. Or it may become broken, causing us to grieve. In some cases it may get lost or stolen. In some cases, we may worry about such losses even before they happen. Husbands and wives worry about losing their spouses even though their partners are faithful. Unfortunately, sometimes our very worry and fear drives us to act irrationally, resulting in distrust and breaking up of the very relationship that we cherished so much.

While we like changes such as becoming an adult when we are in our teens, we dislike the change called aging. While we strive for change to become rich, we fear the change of retrenchment. We are selective in our attitude towards the transient nature of our very existence. Unfortunately, this transient nature is unselective. We can try to fight it, just as many have tried since beginningless time, only to have our efforts washed away through the passages of time. As a result, we continually experience dissatisfaction or suffering due to the very impermanence of compounded phenomena.

Only in the realm of Nirvana   so Mahayana Buddhism insists   can true and lasting happiness be found. Nirvana is the opposite of the conditional, the transitory and the painful (dukkha), so it does not result in disappointment or deterioration of the state of bliss. Nirvana is the refuge from the otherwise universal tyranny of change and suffering. In other schools of Buddhism, nirvana is not viewed as the goal, but merely as a projection from the state of samsara. According to these schools samsara (confusion) and nirvana (perfection) are two sides of the same coin that must be transcended through diligent practice of meditation.

 Anicca .


(P li; Sanskrit: anitya): All compounded phenomena (things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. (Practically) everything is made up of parts, and is dependent on the right conditions for its existence. Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself is constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Nothing lasts.

The important point here is that phenomena arise and cease according to (complex) conditions and not according to our whims and fancy. 
While we have limited ability to effect change to our possessions and surroundings, 
experience tells us that our feeble attempts are no guarantee that the results of our efforts
will be to our likings. More often than not, the results fall short of our expectations.

In Mahayana Buddhism, a caveat is added: one should indeed always meditate on the impermanence and changefulness of compounded structures and phenomena, but one must guard against extending this to the realm of Nirvana, where impermanence holds no sway and eternity alone obtains. To see Nirvana or the Buddha (in his ultimate Dharmakaya nature) as impermanent would be to indulge in "perverted Dharma" and would be seriously to go astray, according to the Buddha's final Mahayana doctrines. Other schools of Buddhism, however, feel uneasy with such a teaching.

 Anatta .


(P li; Sanskrit: an tman): In Indian philosophy, the concept of a Self is called  tman (that is, "soul" or metaphysical Self), which refers to an unchanging, permanent essence conceived by virtue of existence. This concept and the related concept of Brahman, the Vedantic monistic ideal, which was regarded as an ultimate tman for all beings, were indispensable for mainstream Indian metaphysics, logic, and science; for all apparent things there had to be an underlying and persistent reality, akin to a Platonic form. The Buddha rejected all concepts of  tman, emphasizing not permanence, but changeability. He taught that all concepts of a substantial personal Self were incorrect, and formed in the realm of ignorance. However, in a number of major Mahayana sutras (e.g. the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Tathagatagarbha Sutra, the Srimala Sutra, among others), the Buddha is presented as clarifying this teaching by saying that, while the skandhas (constituents of the ordinary body and mind) are not the Self, there does truly exist an eternal, unchanging, blissful Buddha-essence in all sentient beings, which is the uncreated and deathless Buddha-nature ("Buddha-dhatu") or "True Self" of the Buddha himself. This immaculate Buddhic Self (atman) is in no way to be construed as a mundane, impermanent, suffering "ego", of which it is the diametrical opposite. On the other hand, this Buddha-essence or Buddha-nature is also often explained as the potential for achieving Buddhahood, rather than an existing phenomenon one can grasp onto as being me or Self. It is the opposite of a personalised, samsaric "I" or "mine". The paradox is that as soon as the Buddhist practitioner tries to grasp at this inner Buddha potency and cling to it as though it were his or her ego writ large, it proves elusive. It does not "exist" in the time-space conditioned and finite mode in which mundane things are bodied forth. It is presented by the Buddha in the relevant sutras as ultimately inexplicable, primordially present Reality itself - the living potency for Buddhahood inside all beings. It is finally revealed (in the last of the Buddha's Mahayana sutras, the Nirvana Sutra) not as the circumscribed "non-Self", the clinging ego (which is indeed anatta/anatman), but as the ever-enduring, egoless Great Self or Dharmakaya of the Buddha. 

The scriptural evidence of the Nik yas and  gamas is ambivalent with regard to the Buddha's reported views on the existence or otherwise of a permanent Self ( tman/atta). Though he is clearly reported to have criticized many of the heterodox concepts concerning an eternal personal Self and to have denied the existence of an eternal Self with regards to any of the constituent elements (skandha) of a being,  he is nevertheless not reported to have explicitly denied the existence of a non-personal, permanent Self, contrary to the popular, orthodox view of the Buddha's teachings. Moreover, when the Buddha predicates "an tman" (anatta) with regards to the constituents of a being, there is a grammatical ambivalence in the use of the term. The most natural interpretation is that he is simply stating that "the constituents are not the Self" rather than "the constituents are devoid of Self". This ambivalence was to prove troublesome to Buddhists after the Buddha's passing. Some of the major schools of Buddhism that developed subsequently maintained the former interpretation, but other influential schools adopted the latter interpretation and took measures to establish their view as the orthodox Buddhist position.

One such proponent of this hard-line "non-Self" position was the monk Nagasena, who appears in the Questions of King Milinda, composed during the period of the Hellenistic Indo-Greek kingdom of the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. In this text, Nagasena demonstrates the concept of absolute 'non-Self' by likening human beings to a chariot and challenges the Greek king "Milinda" (Menander) to find the essence of the chariot. Nagasena states that just as a chariot is made up of a number of things, none of which are the essence of the chariot in isolation, without the other pieces, similarly no one part of a person is a permanent entity; we can be broken up into five constituents   body, sensations, ideation, mental formations and consciousness   the consciousness being closest to the permanent idea of 'Self', but is ever-changing with each new thought according to this viewpoint.

According to some thinkers both in the East and the West, the doctrine of "non-Self", may imply that Buddhism is a form of nihilism or something similar. However, as thinkers like Nagarjuna have clearly pointed out, Buddhism is not simply a rejection of the concept of existence (or of meaning, etc.) but of the hard and fast distinction between existence and non-existence, or rather between being and no-thingness. Phenomena are not independent from causes and conditions, and do not exist as isolated things as we perceive them to be. Philosophers such as Nagarjuna stress that the lack of a permanent, unchanging, substantial Self in beings and things does not mean that they do not experience growth and decay on the relative level. But on the ultimate level of analysis, one cannot distinguish an object from its causes and conditions, or even object and subject. (This is an idea appearing relatively recently in Western science.) Buddhism thus has much more in common with Western empiricism, pragmatism, anti-foundationalism, and even poststructuralism than with nihilism.

In the Nik yas, the Buddha and his disciples are commonly found to ask in question or declare "Is that which is impermanent, subject to change, subject to suffering fit to be considered thus: 'This I am, this is mine, this is my self'?" The question which the Buddha posts to his audience is whether compounded phenomena is fit to be considered as self, in which the audience agrees that it is unworthy to be considered so. And in relinquishing such an attachment to compounded phenomena, such a person gives up delight, desire and craving for compounded phenomena and is unbounded by its change. When completely free from attachments, craving or desire to the five aggregates, such a person experiences then transcends the very causes of suffering. 

In this way, the insight wisdom or prajñ  of non-Self gives rise to cessation of suffering, and not an intellectual debate over whether a self exists or not. 

It is by realizing (not merely understanding intellectually, but making real in one's experience) the three marks of conditioned existence that one develops prajñ , which is the antidote to the ignorance that lies at the root of all suffering. From the "tathagatagarbha-Mahayana" perspective (which diverges from the Theravadin understanding of Buddhism), however, a further step is required if full Buddhahood is to be attained: not only seeing what is impermanent, suffering and non-Self in the samsaric sphere, but equally recognising that which is truly Eternal, Blissful, Self, and Pure in the transcendental realm   the realm of Mahaparinirvana.

Interpretations of the three marks by various schools.

Some Buddhist traditions assert that Anatta pervades everything, and is not limited to personality, or soul. These traditions assert that Nirvana also has the quality of Anatta, but that Nirvana (by definition) is the cessation of Dukkha and Anicca.

In Nagarjuna's MMK XXV:19, he says
There is not the slightest difference;
Between Samsara and Nirvana;

This verse points us to an interesting stress between dukkha and nirvana, through an argument based in anatta. This specific stress can be seen to be the key to (and possibly source for the development of) the deity yogas of vajrayana.

The sutra path enjoins us to identify the entire world (internally and externally) as samsara   a continual churning of suffering that nobody wants to be part of.  Our practice is that of leaving the shores of samsara.

On the other hand, we are told that unconditioned, enlightened activity is not actually different from samsara. 

Whereas the deity yoga of vajrayana enjoins us to identify the entire world as nirvana   a continual play of enlightening activity that everyone wishes to  be a part of. Our practice here is that of arriving at the shores of nirvana.

At this level, the distinction between Sutra and Vajrayana remain that of view (departing vs. arriving), but basically the practitioner remains involved in undergoing a transformative development to his or her Weltanschauung, and in this context, these practices remain rooted in psychological change, grounded in the development of Samatha, or training in concentration.

However, there are certain practices in Tantra which are not solely concerned with psychological change; these revolve around the basic idea that it is possible to induce deep levels of concentration through psycho-physical methods as a result of special exercises. The purpose remains the same (to achieve liberating view), but the method involves a 'short cut' for the training in Samatha.

Blackpool International Airport  is a small international airport, 2.6 nautical miles (4.8 km)  southeast of Blackpool, Lancashire in North West England. 

The airport was owned and operated by City Hopper Airports Limited, which also owns Wolverhampton Airport and Biella Airport in Italy, but is under new management after one of its two major shareholders bought out its partner. MAR Properties Ltd has agreed terms to take over full control of Blackpool and Wolverhampton Airports .

Blackpool Airport Limited has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P724) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. 

Several scheduled airlines operate from the airport, as well as chartered holiday flights in summer months. Helicopter operations serve north west England s Irish Sea offshore gas facilities.

Passenger numbers have recently increased sharply, from 377,000 during 2005 to 553,000 in the year to December 2006. Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Jet2.com have seen strong potential in Blackpool, bringing increasing passenger numbers.  

History.
The airport site's first aviation use was in October 1909, when the UK's first official public Flying Meeting was held on a specially laid out site at Squires Gate, followed by another in 1910. Small UK airlines used the airfield during the 1930s. During World War II, Vickers operated an aircraft production facility, producing several thousand Wellington bombers. 

By 1949, the airfield was controlled by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and renamed Blackpool Airport. In the mid 1950s, Hawker Hunter jet fighters were produced in the WW2 factory at the north-east edge of the airfield. 

Since then the airport has been steadily expanding, accommodating helicopter operations for British Gas, and attracting scheduled flights from budget airlines, Jet2 and Ryanair and also scheduled services by smaller operators to the Isle of Man. Since WW2, Squires Gate has also been a thriving centre for private, club and general aviation.  

In 2005, Jet2.com became the first major low cost airline to base an aircraft at Blackpool Airport. This created around 50 new jobs and boosted passenger numbers. They now serve eight destinations from this airport; 5 in Spain and the Canaries (Palma de Mallorca, Alicante, Murcia, Tenerife, Málaga). They also offer a domestic service to Belfast and a 5 times weekly flight to Amsterdam. Services to Faro and Prague have also been added to the network.

Also in 2005, Monarch Airlines set up a new route to Malaga, three times a week, after a year the airline ceased services, blaming low passenger numbers as the reason. However Jet2.com had earlier announced that it would be operating flights to Malaga.

British North West Airlines, the smallest airline based at Blackpool, has now, according to its website, stopped trading for both charter and scheduled flights. The website links all viewers to the rival airline, Manx2, who are providing seats for British North West Airlines passengers free of charge.

 Refurbishment.

In February 2006, the airport completed the investment of £2 million in refurbishing the airport terminal and car parks. The improvements included more check-in desks, new eating facilities, a new information desk, an open-plan departure lounge, more gates, new shopping facilities, an executive lounge, a new flight information screen system, additional baggage reclaim belt and a new interior colour scheme and logo. A new long stay car park was created while the existing area was extended. Later in 2006 the airport extended the aircraft parking area.

<doc id="7401066" title="HiPER" nonfiltered="660" processed="654" dbindex="450666">

The High Power laser Energy Research facility (HiPER), is an experimental laser-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the European Union starting around 2010. HiPER is the first experiment designed specifically to study the "fast ignition" approach to generating nuclear fusion, which uses much smaller lasers than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude.  This offers a total "fusion gain" that is much higher than devices like the National Ignition Facility (NIF), and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.

Perhaps confusingly, a similar ICF experimental setup in Japan is also known as "HIPER", but this is no longer operational.

Background.

Main article: ICF mechanism

The basic idea of any ICF device is to rapidly heat the outer layers of a "target", normally a small plastic sphere containing a a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of deuterium and tritium. The heat burns the plastic into a plasma, which explodes off the surface. Due to Newton's Third Law, the remaining portion of the target is driven inwards, eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a shock wave that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel. When it meets itself in the center of the fuel, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot is raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, which collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel   high enough  density and temperature   this heating process can result in a chain reaction, burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as "ignition", which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the targets. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles, as well as creating a suitable shock wave. The laser beams must also be focussed evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other "drivers" have been suggested, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.

Description.

In the case of HiPER, the driver laser system is similar to existing systems like NIF, but considerably smaller and less powerful. The driver consists of a number of "beamlines" containing  amplifiers at one end of the building. Just prior to firing, the glass is "pumped" to a high-energy state with a series of Xenon flash tubes, causing a population inversion of the neodymium (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a fibre optic, is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so in order to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power. When this process is complete, a pockels cell "switches" the light out of the cavity.

From there it is fed into a very long spatial filter to clean up the resulting pulse. The filter is effectively a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away, where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any "stray" light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam. It is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in ICF laser devices. In the case of HiPER, the filters take up about 50% of the overall length. The beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40 cm   40 cm.

One of the problems encountered in previous experiments, notably the Shiva laser, was that the infrared light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054 nm) couples strongly with the electrons around the target, losing a considerable about of energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an optical frequency multiplier, which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or ultraviolet, respectively. These higher frequencies interact much less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will also use a frequency multiplier on its driver, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the later puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light.

When the amplification process is complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying at one end of the building. Here it is reflected off of a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distance from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber is different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10 ps. The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1 mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.

HiPER differs from most ICF devices in that it also includes a second set of lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20 ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). Here, you start with a short-pulse of a broad-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colors using a pair of diffraction gratings and optical delays. This "stretches" the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse. But because the pulse is now very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1 m) and sit in vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 50 kJ each to generate a total of 200 kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3 kJ to generate a total of 70 kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research.

Fast Ignition and HiPER.
In traditional ICF devices the driver laser is used to compress the target to very high densities. The shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides in the center of the sphere. If the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the Lawson criterion, leading to significant fusion energy production. If the resulting fusion rate is high enough, the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures, causing them to undergo fusion as well. In this case, known as "ignition", a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy. Ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device.

The amount of laser energy needed to effectively compress the targets to ignition conditions has grown rapidly from early estimates. In the "early days" of ICF research in the 1970s it was believed that as little as 1 kilojoules (Kj) would suffice, and a number of experimental lasers were built in order to reach these power levels. When they did, a series of problems, typically related to the homogeneity of the collapse, turned out to seriously disrupt the implosion symmetry and lead to much cooler core temperatures that originally expected. Through the 1980s the estimated energy required to reach ignition grew into the megajoule range, which appeared to make ICF impractical for fusion energy production. For instance, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses about 330 MJ of electrical power to pump the driver lasers, and in the best case is expected to produce about 20 MJ of fusion power output. Without dramatic gains in output, such a device would never be a practical energy source.

The fast ignition approach attempts to avoid these problems. Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel. This is far more efficient than the shock wave, which becomes less important. In HiPER, the compression provided by the driver is "good", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200 kJ and produces densities of about 300 g/cm³. That's about one-third that of NIF, and about the same as generated by the earlier NOVA laser of the 1980s. For comparison, lead is about 11 g/cm³, so this still represents a considerable amount of compression, notably when one considers the target's interior contained light D-T fuel.

Ignition is started by a very-short (~10 picoseconds) ultra-high-power (~70 kJ, 4 PW) laser pulse, aimed through a hole in the plasma at the core. The light from this pulse interacts with the fuel, generating a shower of high-energy (3.5 MeV) relativistic electrons that are driven into the fuel. The electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core, and if this heating is localized enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies.

The overall efficiency of this approach is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4 MJ of infrared power to create ignition that releases about 20 MJ of energy. This corresponds to a "fusion gain"  the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power  of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current HiPER design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270 kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30 MJ, a gain of about 100. Not only does this theoretically outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, HiPER is expected to be about an order of magnitude less expensive than conventional devices like NIF.

Compression is already a fairly well-understood problem, and HiPER is primarily interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process. It is not clear how quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load; while this is known for matter under normal pressures, it's not for the ultra-dense conditions of the compressed fuel. To work efficiently, the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible, in order to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature (energy per unit volume) as high as possible.

How to get the laser light onto that spot is also a matter for further research. One approach uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense "core", essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside. This approach will be tested on the OMEGA-EP system in the US. Another approach, tested successfully on the GEKKO XII laser in Japan, uses a small gold cone that cuts though a small area of the target shell; on heating no plasma is created in this area, leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone. HiPER is currently planning on using the gold cone approach, but will likely study the burning solution as well.

Current Status.
HiPER has now completed a preliminary study, outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction. If successful, which will be known in mid-2007, a three-year period of detailed design would start.

In parallel, the HiPER project also proposes to build smaller laser systems with higher repetition rates. The high powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes as long as a day. Additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.

Key to avoiding these problems is replacing the flash lamps with more efficient pumps, typically based on laser diodes. These are far more efficient at generating light from electricity, and thus run much cooler. More importantly, the light they do generate is fairly monochromatic and can be tuned to frequencies that can be easily absorbed. This means that much less power needs to be used to produce any particular amount of laser light, further reducing the overall amount of heat being generated. The improvement in efficiency can be dramatic; existing experimental devices operate at about 10% overall efficiency, and it is believed "near term" devices will improve this as high as 20%.

HiPER proposes to build a demonstrator diode-pump system producing 10 kJ at 1 Hz or 1 kJ at 10 Hz depending on a design choice yet to be made. The best high-repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller; MERCURY at Livermore is about 70 J, HALNA in Japan at ~20 J, and LUCIA in France at ~100 J. HiPER's demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 1000 times as powerful as any of these.

In order to make a practical commercial power generator, the high-gain of a device like HiPER would have to be combined with a high-repetition rate laser. Additional areas of research for post-HiPER devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production, protecting the device from the neutron flux generated by the fusion reactions, and the production of tritium from this flux in order to produce more fuel for the reactor.

RAF Tain is a bombing range (formal designation: Air Weapons Range) on the Moray Firth near Tain in Scotland. 

The original airfield is abandoned, but still exists within the boundaries of the range. The current station is the largest live bombing range in Europe. It is the only one in Europe where live 1000 lb bombs may be dropped, and is thus crucial to the final certification of fighter pilots. Several World War II airfield buildings in various states of decay can be seen from the road to Inverness and Portmahomack.

Iron Rail Book Collective is an all volunteer run radical library and bookstore in New Orleans. 

The Iron Rail's main focus is as a lending library featuring a wide selection of books ranging from Anarchism and Socialism to Fiction to Gardening to Philosophy to name a few. The Iron Rail also sells records, zines, local CDs and some spray paint art supplies. Free services include an hour of internet and weekly movie nights. 
The Iron Rail also contains the Above Ground Zine Library with a selection of thousands of zines, some very rare. 

 Bookstore .
The Iron Rail features a section of political and underground books for sale. Categories include Feminism, Anarchism, Ecology and Primitivism, Prisons and Police, Native American Studies, Labor Struggles, Globalization, Capitalist Exploitation and Subculture. There is also a selection of cheap used fiction.

 Library .
The Library contains an extensive collection of radical books including Feminism, Anarchism, History, Race Relations, Ecology, Labor Struggles, Cultural Studies, Protest and Activism as well as a wide array of other interesting topics like Philosophy, Art, Language, Health, Fiction and Parenting.

 Library Check Out Policy .
There are two types of library memberships at the Iron Rail. One for residence and one for non-residence. The residential type is 10$ life time and the non-resident is 10$ fee plus a 10$ security deposit. The fee on both on both types can be paid for with three hours of volunteer time however the 10$ deposit is mandatory for anyone visiting New Orleans, or who does not have a stable living situation in the city (including relief workers and out of town volunteers.) The fee's can be traded for 3 hours of volenteer time but the deposit for non-residence is mandotory. The deposit is a much needed addition to the policy. Its purpose is to maintain the library in the event of books being lost which is much more likey in the case of people visiting the city. Zines from the Above Ground Zine Library are not for check out due to their fragile nature.

 The Collective .
The Iron Rail is run by a group of volunteers working together to present a model for a non-authoritarian structure of organizing. The collective meets once a week to discuss the day to day business of running the space; finances, book orders, new policies etc. The collective's members consist of anywhere from 7-15 people on average, and the participation is subject to each person's desire for their own involvement. Some people just come by and shelve books, some people work shifts, some people come in full of ideas of new things for the space to do.

Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator based on three open source software packages: Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice:

 SPICE is the most famous and used electronic circuit simulator.
 Cider is a mixed-level simulator that already includes SPICE 3f5 and adds a device simulator to it: DSIM. Cider couples the circuit level simulator to the device simulator to provide greater simulation accuracy (at the expense of greater simulation time). Critical devices can be described with technology parameters (numerical models) and non critical ones with the original SPICE's compact models.
 Xspice is an extension to SPICE 3 that provides code modeling support and simulation of digital components through an embedded event driven algorithm.

Eddie Foy Jr. (February 4, 1905 - July 15, 1983) was an American character actor.

Born Edwin Fitzgerald Jr. in New Rochelle, New York, the son of vaudevillian Eddie Foy and his third wife, Madeline Morando, he was one of the "Seven Little Foys" immortalized in the 1955 film of the same name. He was the only one of the septet to remain in show business beyond childhood. Throughout the 1930s and '40s he appeared in dozens of B movies. He portrayed his own father in four feature films - Frontier Marshal (1939), Lillian Russell (1940), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), and Wilson, and again in a 1964 telefilm about the family's early days in vaudeville. Additional film credits include The Farmer Takes a Wife, The Pajama Game, Bells Are Ringing, and Gidget Goes Hawaiian.

Foy made his Broadway debut in Florenz Ziegfeld's 1930 extravanaganza Show Girl. He also appeared in The Red Mill, The Pajama Game, Donnybrook!, and Rumple, for which he received a Tony Award nomination as Best Actor in a Musical. 

Foy found steady work with the advent of television. In addition to a leading role in the first hour-long sitcom, Fair Exchange, he made numerous guest appearances on such programs as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, My Living Doll, Burke's Law, ABC Stage 67, My Three Sons, and Nanny and the Professor.   

Foy died of pancreatic cancer in Woodland Hills, California.

Macapá (mekepä ) is the capital of the state of Amapá in Brazil, (2005 pop. 339,500), on the Amazon River. Mining is central to its economy. It exports tin iron, gold, and manganese, as well as lumber, oil, animal pelts, and fish. Manufactures include rubber products and automobiles. Founded (1688) by military men in the vicinity of a fortress protecting access to the mouth of the Amazon, Macapá grew very slowly until it became the capital of Amapá, which was created (as a federal territory) in 1943. The old fortress is now a regional museum.

The city lies exactly on the Equator, at 0º N, and hosts a monument to this, known as Marco Zero (Zero Mark). Next to it there are both a sambadrome and a football stadium (the Zerão), proud to be the only one in the world where each half of the field is located in opposite hemispheres.

<doc id="3402978" title="YFM Airacuda" nonfiltered="673" processed="665" dbindex="450679">


The American Bell YFM-1 Airacuda was the first military aircraft produced by the Bell Aircraft Corporation. Originally designated the "Bell Model 1," the Airacuda first flew on 1 September 1937. The Airacuda was marked by bold design advances and considerable flaws that eventually grounded the plane. 

The Airacuda was Bell Aircraft's answer for a "Bomber Destroyer" type aircraft. Although the aircraft did see limited production, and one fully operational squadron was eventually formed, only one prototype and thirteen production models were ultimately produced in three slightly different versions.

Design and development.
In an effort to  break into the airplane business, Bell Aircraft fashioned a unique fighter concept that was touted to be "a mobile anti-aircraft platform"  as well as a "convoy fighter." Created to intercept enemy bombers at distances beyond the range of single-seat fighter interceptors, the YFM-1 (the designation was for (Y)a prototype (F) fighter (M) multiplace) was a unique design incorporating many features never before seen in a military aircraft, as well as several never seen again. Utilizing a streamlined, "futuristic" design, the Bell Airacuda appeared to be "unlike any other fighters up to that time." 

According to Major Alexander De Seversky's 1942 book, Victory Through Air Power, the Bell Airacuda "represents a great engineering achievement. But its designation as 'convoy fighter' is erroneous, since that requires different disposition of armament. With its maximum firepower directed forward, it really offers a preview of an  effective long-range interceptor fighter." 

A single forward firing M4 37 mm cannon with an accompanying gunner was mounted in a forward compartment in each of the engine nacelles. Although capable of aiming the cannons, the gunner's primary purpose was simply to load them with the 110 rounds of ammunition stored in each nacelle.

The large crew of five included a fire-control officer in the nose who used a Sperry autopilot, a fire control system originally developed for anti-aircraft cannon, and an optical sight to aim the  weapons. This crewmember could also use a periscope mounted below the nose to monitor the rear and, hopefully, spot enemy fighters coming up in the Airacuda's "blind spot."

Design flaws.
The Airacuda was plagued with problems from the start. The lofty performance estimates were unobtainable as, despite the sleek look, the heavy Airacuda was dragged down (literally) and was slower than most bombers. In the event of interception by enemy fighters, the Airacuda was not maneuverable enough to dogfight, while the meager 600 lb (272 kg) bomb load was of little use in the intended fighter-bomber role. Even the centerpiece, main 37 mm cannon armament, were perilous to use. The cannons had a tendency to fill the gun nacelles with smoke whenever fired and, additionally, fears persisted as to how the gunners would escape in an emergency, with the propellers directly behind them. An emergency bailout would have required both propellers to be feathered.   

The Allison V-1710-13 engines, though relatively trouble free in other types, had no additional cooling systems. Like many pusher designs, they were prone to overheating. On the ground, the aircraft had to be towed to and from the runway and could only be started when the Airacuda was able to takeoff immediately. Even in the air it was not uncommon to experience overheating problems. Although designed for turbo-supercharging, the first flights were made with V-1710-9 carbureted engines that only delivered 1000 hp (76040 kg) each. Despite the long five ft shaft extensions, there were no problems with this feature. When the turbos were fitted to the later YFM-1, they were plagued by cranky turbo regulators that backfired continuously. An explosion during a September 1939 test flight made it apparent that the teething engine troubles would not be solved easily. 

Initial flight testing by Lt. Ben Kelsey proved the plane virtually impossible to control on a single  engine, as the aircraft would go into an immediate spin. Pitch problems were also encountered, and had to be corrected by reducing power. Test pilot Erik Shilling described his experiences in a later book, Destiny: A Flying Tiger's Rendezvous With Fate as:
Flying the Bell Airacuda was a new experience for me, since it was the first pusher aircraft I'd ever flown. Its handling characteristics were foreign to anything I had ever had my hands on. Under power it was unstable in pitch, but stable with power off. While flying straight and level, if a correction in pitch was required, a forward push on the control resulted in the airplane wanting to pitch over even more. Pitch control became a matter of continually jockeying the controls, however slightly, even when the aircraft was in proper trim. The same applied if pulling back on the control. It would tend to continue pitching up, requiring an immediate corrective response. The same happened in a turn with power off, the Bell became stable in pitch. This was fortunate because during approach and landing, it was very stable, and a nice flying airplane." 

The Airacuda was also saddled by a complex and temperamental electrical system and was the only aircraft ever built to rely on an independent auxiliary power unit (APU) to power both engine fuel pumps, as well as all aircraft electrical systems.  Systems usually powered by an aircraft's engines were instead powered by the single generator. The generator, with its own supercharger, was located in the belly of the aircraft. In the event of a failure (and they occurred frequently), the crew was instructed to begin immediate emergency restart procedures as the aircraft basically shut down. When the APU failed, the pilot had "NO fuel pressure, NO vacuum, NO hydraulic pressure, NO gear, NO flaps and NO ENGINES."

Variants.
The prototype, known as the XFM-1, incorporated a tail wheel, side "blister" ports, and a smooth, rounded canopy. This is the best known, and most produced version. An updated version called the YFM-1 eliminated the side blisters and added externally mounted radiators and turbo-superchargers. Produced in 1940, the final version designated YFM-1A, was slightly larger, had more powerful Allison engines and incorporated a tricycle landing gear. The canopy was redesigned, with a flat forward windshield. A rearward-facing belly gunner's position was also added. The resulting aircraft was roughly the size of a Douglas B-18 bomber. Three YFM-1As were produced in 1939. 

Operational service.
Despite these problems, one fully operational Airacuda squadron was eventually assembled, and operated from 1938 until 1940, although due to continuing problems, they were mainly "hangar queens."  Towards the end of the type's operational life, the aircraft were flown primarily for photo opportunities and always accompanied by a chase plane for safety. In late 1940, the aircraft were stricken from inventory. All 13 Airacudas were flown to a training facility located outside Chicago where they were used for ground crew instruction. Before the end of World War II, all Airacudas were ignominiously scrapped, ending a promising, if daunting technological venture.

Wymering is a residential area of the city of Portsmouth in the English county of Hampshire. Unlike the majority of Portsmouth, it is located on the mainland rather than Portsea Island.

Wymering is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was a small village in rural area until it was incorporated into Portsmouth in 1920. On incorporation into Portsmouth a small social housing estate was built to the north of the village. Over the next twenty years this was expanded until Wymering became predominantly social housing with little of the original village remaining.

One building that did remain is Wymering Manor. The manor is the oldest building in Portsmouth. It is now a Youth Hostel and is reputed to be haunted.

Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror.  This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status.

Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.  The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant.

Khantumani chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

Common names: western diamondback rattlesnake, western diamond-backed rattlesnake, more.
 
 
Crotalus atrox is a venomous rattlesnake species found in the United States and Mexico. No subspecies are currently recognized.

 Description .
C. atrox is generally colored a shade of dark or light brown. Its pattern is a distinctive row of large, dark diamond shapes edged in yellow trim, running down the length of its body. The diamonds fade to dark rings around the tail, where the distinctive rattle begins. A dark stripe edged in yellow runs back from the mouth to the eyes on each side of the head. There is no significant difference in appearance between males and females except that males are generally larger. They grow to an average length of 4  feet, but can reach a maximum length 6  feet.

Though large and bulky in appearance, C. atrox can strike up to two-thirds of its body length. That's about a three to four foot striking range for larger specimens. It strikes with two large, hollow fangs which inject venom into its prey eventually killing it (venom is lethal to small animals within minutes). The fangs are retractable and replaceable as venomous snakes lose and replace fangs often. Movement is in a rectili fashion (unlike sidewinders).

Diet.
The diamondback eats small mammals and birds, and sometimes other reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, rabbits, mice, rats, gophers, sparrows, and ground squirrels. It eats every two to three weeks and swallows its food whole. The food is digested as it passes through the body. Its annual water consumption is about its body weight. In very dry areas it also absorbs water from its prey.

Common names.
Western diamondback rattlesnake, western diamond-backed rattlesnake, Adobe snake, Arizona diamond rattlesnake, coon tail, desert diamond-back, desert diamond rattlesnake, fierce rattlesnake, spitting rattlesnake, Texan rattlesnake, Texas diamond-back (rattlesnake).

Behavior and reproduction.
Western diamondbacks can live for more than twenty years, but life expectancy is typically shorter because of hunting and human expansion. Solitary outside of mating season, they are one of the more aggressive species found in North America because they rarely back away from confrontation. When threatened they usually coil and shake their rattle to warn an aggressor that it has stumbled upon something dangerous. There is suspicion that some rattlesnakes (and the diamondback in particular) which generally live around populated areas do not rattle as often because it leads to the snake s discovery and consequent destruction. However, there is little available evidence of this hypothesis.

C. atrox, like other desert snakes, can go for up to two years without food in the wild. A 5  month starvation study showed that the snakes reduced energy expenditures by an average of 80% over the length of the study. The snakes also feed from within on energy-rich lipid stores. The most interesting finding was that the snakes grew during the study, indicating that while the snake's mass was shrinking, it was putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone.

In the winter the snakes will go into small caves to hibernate. This is about the only time that they do not want to bite each other. They can remember which cave they go to hibernate. The Western Diamondback also isn't very aggressive when they are in the caves.

The snake is a poor climber and primarily hunts small mammals, but will also feed on birds, small reptiles and amphibians. They hunt (or ambush prey) at night or early morning using a type of infrared sense prominently found in pit vipers. Although adult specimens have no natural predators, hawks, eagles, and other snakes can prey on young or adolescent individuals.

Rattlesnakes, including C. atrox, are viviparous. Gestation period lasts six or seven months and broods average about a dozen young. However, the young only stay with the mother for a few hours before they set off on their own to hunt and find recluse, thus the mortality rate is very high.The Western Diamondback Rattlesnake is the most commonly encountered rattlesnake in Texas. The Western Diamondback is the longest rattlesnake in the state, and one of the two heaviest (the other is the Timber Rattlesnake). The record length is over 213 cm (84 in); adults found in the wild typically measure between 0.91-1.21 m (3-4 ft). Its common name does not come unearned; a series of diamond-shaped blotches runs down the length of its back, and each blotch is surrounded by a light border. A background coloration of tan or brown surrounds the blotches, and the dorsal coloration varies tremendously over its distributional range. This rattlesnake can easily be distinguished by its black and white tail, which also earns the western diamondback the name "coontail" (also, see below). Its off-white belly is usually unmarked, its anal scale is undivided, and its dorsal scales are extremely keeled, often in rows of 25 to 27 near midbody. 

Similar species. -- Crotalus atrox may be confused with a number of snakes found in Texas, most of which are non-venomous. The majority of these snakes, however, lack the key feature of a rattle found at the end of the tail. Many snakes, including gopher snakes (Pituophis) and hognose snakes (Heterodon) may show an impressive threat display and have similar brown and tan markings, but lack the rattles. Some rattle-less snakes such as rat snakes and copperheads may vibrate their tails. Like all rattlesnakes, Crotalus atrox has a heat-sensing pit between the eye and nostril. The dorsal markings of rattlesnakes range from the distinct diamond-shaped (rhomboid) marks in Crotalus atrox and the Mojave Rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus), to dorsal blotches in the Prairie Rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) and the Western Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), to narrower crossbands extending down the sides of the body in the Rock Rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus). The pattern of the Western Diamondback is most similar to that of the Mojave Rattlesnake and the Prairie Rattlesnake. The color of the tail is a useful key to discriminate C. atrox from most other rattlesnakes. In C. atrox, the tail is completely encircled with white and black bands of equal widths. The Mojave Rattlesnake, Crotalus scutulatus, is the only other Texas rattlesnake with such prominent black and white bands around its tail, but the white bands are twice as wide as the black bands. Crotalus scutulatus does have similar dorsal rhomboid markings running the length of its body, yet these blotches flatten into bands in the posterior third of the body; the diamond markings of C. atrox do not flatten into bands. Adult Mojave Rattlesnakes usually reach lengths of only about three feet, so any very large rattlesnakes are most likely Western Diamondbacks. 

Natural History. -- All rattlesnakes are venomous, and therefore potentially dangerous if approached or handled. Rattlesnakes are not generally aggressive and will most likely flee if given a chance to retreat. Found from the flatlands and prairies to the rocky hills and low mountains, the Western Diamondback is a key participant in the food web; it is an important predator of many small rodents, rabbits, and birds. The Western Diamondback is in turn preyed upon by a variety of larger mammals and birds, such as coyotes, foxes, and hawks. It is primarily a nocturnal animal, hunting for its prey on warm summer nights. It is, however, seasonally diurnal, moving between hunting sites during the day during the cooler spring and fall months. The Western Diamondback is usually inactive between late October and early March, though an occassional rattlesnake may be seen sunning itself on warm winter days. Mating occurs in the spring and the females give birth (they are viviparous) to as many as 25 young, which may be as long as 30 cm (12 inches) in length. The young are fully capable of delivering a venomous bite hours after their birth. 

Distribution. -- Crotalus atrox is found in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma and Texas. The Western Diamondback also has an extensive range in the the northern half of Mexico. In Texas, Crotalus atrox is found throughout the state, save the wettest eastern portions of the state. Its relative, the Eastern Diamondback (Crotalus adamanteus), is found in eastern Louisiana and ranges from there through Florida to Northa Carolina.

Range & habitat.
C. atrox is found both in the United States (South-East California, South Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas) and in Mexico (Hidalgo). Habitat surroundings are similar to that of C. adamanteus but generally in more arid and rocky country. Nevertheless, they are also good swimmers.

Venom.
Although the venom of the diamondback isn't particularly toxic, the size of the snake allows a larger capacity of venom which is released from its two prominent fangs. It's not uncommon that only one bite mark from one fang is visible after a strike. Fangs can break or bend, or the bite area may be small, causing a miss. All pit vipers have the ability to control the flow of venom through their fangs, allowing the diamondback to release most of its venom in a single strike (though often a pit viper will not release any of its venom). The venom capacity combined with the aggressiveness of the snake make it dangerous and lethal, and responsible for several recorded deaths.

Most of the toxin released is proteolytic like all other American pit vipers. Proteolytic venoms are, in fact, advanced and concentrated fluids that destroy tissues and other cells through intramolecular digestion. A few toxic effects include: cytotoxic (destoys cells), hemotoxic (destroys red blood cells), myotoxic (causes paralysis and muscle destruction), hemorrhagic (causes persistent bleeding). Smaller amounts of neurotoxins are also present. Rattlesnakes have the most potent hemotoxic venom of any snake, making them one of the most dangerous snakes in the world. Unlike neurotoxins, hemotoxin poisoning becomes quickly apparent; the area around the wound swells at a rapid rate. Discoloration and pain are also experienced shortly after being bitten. Professional medical attention should be sought immediately, especially when the victim is a child. The smaller the victim the less time it takes for the poison to spread. Although it is commonly believed that baby or young rattlesnakes deliver more concentrated venom and are thus more dangerous, this idea is not supported by scientific evidence. The amount of venom delivered is a much more important indicator of the bite's danger than the venom's concentration, and since larger (older) snakes can deliver much more venom, larger rattlesnakes should always be considered more dangerous.

Captivity.
C. atrox is frequently bred in captivity, and readily available in the exotic animal trade. Many color variations are bred, including albinos, patternless, and melanistic. They are also heavily collected from the wild, frequently being drawn out of their hiding places with gasoline, and used in rattlesnake roundups where they are killed for entertainment. Despite this, their population is not considered to be threatened.

Southern Dobruja (             , Yuzhna Dobrudzha in Bulgarian, Dobrogea de sud or Cadrilater in Romanian) is an area of north-eastern Bulgaria comprising the administrative districts named for its two principal cities of Dobrich and Silistra. It has an area of 7565 km² and a population of 358,000. 

History.



At the beginning of the modern era, Southern Dobruja had a mixed population of Bulgarians and Turks with several smaller minorities, including Gagauz, Crimean Tatars and Romanians. In 1910, of the 282,007 inhabitants of Southern Dobruja, 134,355 (47.6%) were Bulgarians, 106,568 (37.8%) Turks, 12,192 (4.3%) Gypsies, 11,718 (4.1%) Tatars and 6,484 (2.4%) Romanians.

Southern Dobruja was part of the autonomous Bulgarian principality from the time of the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878 until the Balkan Wars. After the defeat of Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War, the region was incorporated into Romania under the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest. Romania ruled Southern Dobruja until 1940 settling tens of thousands of Aromanians from Macedonia and Northern Greece, as well as Romanians from Wallachia in the region. 

On 7 September 1940 Southern Dobruja was restored to Bulgaria under the Treaty of Craiova. The treaty was followed by an obligatory population exchange: about 110,000 Romanians (over 95% of which settled there after 1913) were forced to leave Southern Dobruja, whereas 77,000 Bulgarians had to leave northern Dobruja. Only a few hundred Romanians and Aromanians are left in the region to this day.

The Hungarian Reformed Church (Magyarországi Református Egyház in Hungarian) is a key  representative of the Magyar Christianity, being numerically the second-largest denomination in Hungary, after the Roman Catholic Church, and the biggest denomination among ethnic Hungarians in Romania.

 History .

During the Reformation, Hungary was struggling to resist the influence of the Austrian and Holy Roman Empires.

Some German-speaking students from Hungary in Wittenberg brought Lutheran ideas to their home in 1524.  In order to gain support Ferdinand I and Maximilian II (1564-76) allowed some nobles and cities to choose their religion.
Most of the Germans adopted the Lutheran doctrines and organized their church at the Synod of Erdod, in 1545, while the Magyars organized their church at the Synod of Czenger in 1557, and at the Debrecen Synod of 1567 the Helvetic Confession was adopted.

When in 1606 Emperor Rudolph II suppressed religious liberty, Prince István Bocskay of Transylvania, allied with the Ottoman Turks, achieved autonomy for Transylvania, including guaranteeing religious freedom in the rest of Hungary for a short time. Then, religious persecution lasted until the mid-19th century.

The Church was closely linked with Hungarian nationalism, attaining full liberty in the revolutionary year of 1848. The revolt was decisively put down by the Habsburgs, but the 1867 accord with Austria, resulting in the dual monarchy, gave near-independence to Hungary. After WWI, Transylvania was incorporated into Romania, dividing the Church. The church struggled for its survival during the Communist regime, especially after the 1956 Revolution. Emigration also helped to spread the Reformed faith of the Hungarians throughout the world.

 Practices .

 Organization .

The Reformed Church in Hungary is the only Reformed church with an episcopal form of church government. Today (2005) there are 22 Hungarian Reformed denominations. The Reformed Church in Hungary consists of four Districts headed by Bishops, almost 30 presbyteries with 1,500 churches, with a membership of around 2.4 million. There is a fraternal body, the World Federation Reformed Hungarians, with members in about 20 countries. The RCH is member of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the World Council of Churches.

The Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) is a cryptographic protocol which enables the remote authentication of a trusted platform whilst preserving the user's privacy. The protocol has been adopted by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) in the latest version of its Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specification as a result of privacy concerns (see also Loss_of_Internet_anonymity).

 Historical perspective .
In principle the privacy issue could be resolved using any standard signature scheme (or public key encryption). Manufacturers would embed the secret key into every TPM produced and the public key would be published. Signatures produced by the TPM must have originated from the secret key, by the nature of the technology, and since all TPMs use the same key they are indistinguishable ensuring the user's privacy. This rather naive solution relies upon the assumption that there exists a global secret. One only needs to look at the precedent of Content Scramble System (CSS), an encryption system for DVDs, to see that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Furthermore this approach fails to realise a secondary goal, the ability to detect rogue TPMs, that is a TPM that has been compromised and had its secrets extracted.

The solution first adopted by the TCG (TPM specification v1.1) required a trusted third party, namely a privacy certificate agency (privacy CA). Each TPM has an embedded RSA key pair called an Endorsement Key (EK) which the privacy CA is assumed to know. In order to attest the TPM generates a second RSA key pair called an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). It sends AIK, signed by EK, to the privacy CA who checks its validity and issues a certificate for the AIK. The host/TPM is now able to authenticate itself with respect to the certificate. This approach permits two possibilities to detecting rogue TPMs: firstly the privacy CA should maintain a list of EKs known to be rogue and reject requests from them, secondly if a privacy CA receives too many requests from a particular EK it may wish reject them. The number of permitted requests should be subject to a risk management exercise. This solution is problematic since the privacy CA must take part in every transaction and thus must provide high availability whilst remaining secure. Furthermore privacy requirements may be violated if the privacy CA and verifier collude. Although the latter issue can probably be resolved using blind signatures, the first remains.

 Overview .

The DAA protocol is based on three entities and two different steps. The entities are the TPM platform, the DAA Issuer and the DAA verifier. The issuer is charged to verify the TPM platform during the Join step and to issue DAA credential to the platform. The platform uses the DAA credential with the verifier during the Sign step. Through a zero-knowledge proof the verifier can verify the credential without attempting to violate the platform's privacy.


 Privacy properties .

The protocol allows differing degrees of privacy. Interactions are always anonymous, but the user/verifier may negotiate as to whether the verifier is able to link transactions. This would allow user profiling and/or the rejection of requests originating from a host which has made too many requests.

<doc id="1166019" title="RMS Tayleur" nonfiltered="687" processed="679" dbindex="450693">
The RMS Tayleur was a fully-rigged iron clipper chartered by the White Star Line and her fate would be a black mark on that company for years to come.  

History.
Construction.
The Tayleur was designed by William Rennie of Liverpool and built for owners Charles Moore & Company. When she was launched in Warrington on the River Mersey on October 4, 1853 - it had taken just six months to build her - Tayleur was the largest merchant ship on the seas. She was 230 feet in length with a 40 foot beam and displaced 1,750 tons, while 4,000 tons of cargo could be carried in holds 28 feet deep below three decks. She was named for Charles Tayleur, founder of the Vulcan Engineering Works, Bank Quay, Warrington.

The new ship was chartered by White Star to serve the booming Australian trade routes, as transport to and from the colony was in high demand due to the discovery of gold there.

Disaster.
Tayleur left Liverpool on 19 January 1854, on her maiden voyage, for Melbourne, Australia, with a complement of 652 passengers and crew.  Her crew of 71 had only 37 trained seamen amongst them, and of these ten could not speak English (a number of the crew were accused in newspaper accounts of the time to be merely seeking free passage to Australia). However most of the crew survived.

Her compasses did not work properly because of the iron hull. The crew believed that they were sailing south through the Irish Sea, but were actually travelling west towards Ireland. On 21 January 1854, within 48 hours of sailing Tayleur found in fog, in a storm and heading straight for land. The rudder was undersized for her tonnage, and when land was sighted through the mists, she was unable to tack around Lambay Island. The rigging was also faulty, and the ropes had not been properly stretched. They became slack, making it nearly impossible to control the sails.  Despite dropping both anchors as soon as rocks were sighted, she ran aground on the east coast of Lambay Island, about five miles from Dublin Bay. 

Initially, attempts were made to lower the ship's lifeboats, but when the first one was smashed on the rocks, launching further boats was deemed unsafe. Tayleur was so close to land that the crew was able to collapse a mast onto the shore, and some people aboard were able to jump onto land by clambering along the collapsed mast. Some that reached shore had carried ropes from the ship, allowing others to pull themselves to safety on the ropes. Captain Noble waited onboard Tayleur until the last minute, then jumped towards shore, being rescued by one of the passengers.

With the storm and high seas continuing, the ship was then washed into deeper water. She sank to the bottom with only the tops of her masts showing. One survivor, William Vivers, climbed to the tops of the rigging, spending 14 hours there until he was rescued. Out of the 652 people onboard, 380 lives - many of them immigrants - were lost. Out of over 100 women onboard, only three survived, possibly because of the difficulty with the clothing of that era. The survivors were then faced with having to get up an almost sheer 80 foot (24m) cliff to get to shelter. When word of the disaster reached the Irish mainland, the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company sent the steamer Prince to look for survivors. 

Although newspaper accounts at the time blamed the crew for negligence, the official Coroner's Inquest absolved Captain Noble and placed the blame on the ship's owners, accusing them of neglect for allowing the ship to depart without its compasses being properly adjusted. The Board of Trade, however, did fault the Captain for not taking soundings, a standard practice when sailing in low visibility.

The wreck currently lies in 18 metres of water.
    
The Tayleur has been compared with RMS Titanic . Both were RMS ships and White Star Liners. Technically innovative like the Titanic, both had a serious claim to being the largest ship of their time.  Additionally, both vessels went down on their maiden voyages, and inadequate or faulty equipment contributed to both disasters (Faulty compasses and rigging for the Tayleur, and an inadequate flooding control system and lifeboats for Titanic).

"Corpus Earthling" is an episode of the original The Outer Limits television show. It first aired on 18 November, 1963, during the first season.

Introduction.
A surgeon with a steel plate in his head as a result of a war injury, suddenly finds himself hearing strange voices discussing global conquest. 

Opening narration.
"Rocks: silent, inanimate objects torn from the Earth's ancient crust. Yielding up to man over the long centuries all that is in know of the planet on which we live withholding from man forever their veiled secrets of the nature of matter and cosmic catastrophe, the secrets of other worlds in the vastness of the universe, of other forms of life, of strange organisms beyond the imagination of man.";

Plot synopsis.


Intelligent parasitic aliens with the intention of commandeering the human race take refuge in a geologist's laboratory disguised as rocks. Although undetected by ordinary humans, one doctor (with a surgically-implanted metal plate in his skull) is able to "hear" the aliens communicate with each other while they are discussing their plot. Although the doctor is unsure if he what he hears is delusional or real, the aliens are convinced he is a threat to their plans and set out to kill him.

Closing narration.
"Two black crystalline rocks: unclassifiable. Objects on the border between the living and the nonliving. A reminder of the thin line that separates the animate from the inanimate. Something to ponder on. Something to stay the hand when it reaches out innocently for the whitened pebble, the veined stone, the dead unmoving rocks of our planet.";

<doc id="7817220" title="Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Stevic" nonfiltered="693" processed="685" dbindex="450699">


In Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407 (1984), the U.S. Supreme Court decided that an alien seeking to avoid deportation proceedings by claiming that he would be persecuted if returned to his native land must show a "clear probability" that he will not be persecuted there.

Facts.
In 1976, Stevic, a citizen of the former Yugoslavia, entered the United States to visit his sister in Chicago.  He overstayed his visa, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation proceedings against him.  At the hearing, Stevic conceded that he was deportable and agreed to leave by February 1977.  In January of that year, however, he married a United States citizen, who applied for a visa on Stevic's behalf.  When Stevic's wife died in a car accident shortly after the wedding, however, the visa was automatically revoked, and the INS ordered Stevic deported.  

Stevic then sought withholding of deportation, claiming that he would be persecuted in Yugoslavia for anti-Communist activities in which he had engaged after his wedding.  He also said that his father-in-law had been imprisoned there, also for anti-Communist activities.  He claimed he feared persecution should he return to Yugoslavia.  The Board of Immigration Appeals ultimately denied his application without a hearing, explaining that Stevic had not presented any further evidence he would be persecuted in Yugoslavia.  The BIA also rejected Stevic's second attempt in 1980 to forestall deportation, despite a change in the law passed by Congress that arguably might have been more favorable to Stevic.  

Stevic appealed the 1980 decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  That court held that the law simply required an alien to show a well-founded fear of persecution, instead of a clear probability, and remanded the case to the immigration department for a plenary hearing.  The INS asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.

Majority Opinion.
This case centered on the change of the law imposed by Congress in 1980, and whether that change lowered the standard for claiming asylum from a clear probability of persecution to a well-founded fear of persecution.  The Court stated that "in 1980 Congress intended to adopt a standard of withholding of deportation claims by reference to pre-existing sources of law."  There were three such sources -- U.S. law before 1968; the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, to which the United States acceded in 1968; and U.S. law between 1968 and 1980.

Before 1968, U.S. law required an alien to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution in order to be eligible for withholding of deportation.  But withholding of deportation was only available to aliens within the United States and not at the border; the U.S. Attorney General could not conditionally admit aliens for limited purposes until 1976.  The United States acceded to the U.N. protocol on refugees in 1968, but both the President and the Senate believed that acceding to the protocol would require no modification of statutory law.  In 1973, however, the BIA confronted the issue of whether acceding to the U.N. protocol modified the standard for withholding of deportation.  It concluded the protocol did not change the standard.  Nevertheless, the term "well-founded fear" crept into some court decisions.  The Seventh Circuit concluded in 1977 that a well-founded fear of persecution was functionally equivalent to a clear probability of persecution, and the Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits reached the same conclusion as well.

In 1980, Congress finally conformed U.S. statutory law to the U.N. protocol.  But these modifications did not clarify how great a possibiltiy of persecution must exist before the alien can qualify for withholding of removal.  The statute spoke of withholding if the alien's life "would" be threatened, not if it "might" or "could" be threatened.  Other statutes dealing with the discretionary grant of asylum referred to the well-founded-fear standard; the statutes dealing with withholding of deportation, by contrast, did not.  The Court thus concluded that there was some higher standard required for the alien to receive the mandatory relief of withholding of removal.  The Court assumed, arguendo, that the standard for discretionary relief was lower than that for mandatory relief, and thus held that "an application withholding of deportation be supported by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds."  The Court then ordered the Second Circuit to decide whether Stevic would be entitled to withholding of deportation under the standard it articulated.

<doc id="6302360" title="Dark field microscopy" nonfiltered="694" processed="686" dbindex="450700">
Dark field microscopy is an optical microscopy illumination technique used to enhance the contrast in unstained samples. It works on the principle of illuminating the sample with light that will not be collected by the objective lens, so not form part of the image. This produces the classic appearance of a dark, almost black, background with bright objects on it.

The light's path.

 Light enters the microscope for illumination of the sample.
 The condenser lens focuses the light towards the sample.
 A specially sized disc, the "patch stop" blocks some light from the sample, leaving an outer ring of illumination.
 The light enters the sample. Most is directly transmitted, while some is scattered from the sample.
 The scattered light enters the objective lens, while the directly transmitted light simply misses the lens and is not collected.
 Only the scattered light goes on to produce the image, while the directly transmitted light is omitted.

Advantages and disadvantages.

Dark field microscopy is a very simple yet effective technique and well suited for uses involving live and unstained biological samples, such as a smear from a tissue culture or individual water borne single-celled organisms. Considering the simplicity of the setup the quality of images obtained from this technique is impressive.

The main limitation of dark field microscopy is the low light levels seen in the final image. This means the sample must be very strongly illuminated, and can cause damage to the sample.

Dark field microscopy techniques, due to the simplicity of the setup, are almost entirely free of artefacts. However the interpretation of dark field images must be done with care as common dark features of bright field microscopy images may be invisible, and vice versa.

<doc id="3692001" title="Insertion sequence" nonfiltered="695" processed="687" dbindex="450701">
An insertion sequence (also known as an IS, an insertion sequence element, or an IS element) is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500 bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes). These proteins are usually the transposase which catalyses the enzymatic reaction allowing the IS to move, and also one regulatory protein which either stimulates or inhibits the transposition activity. The coding region in an insertion sequence is usually flanked by inverted repeats. For example, the well-known IS911 (1250 bp) is flanked by two 36bp inverted repeat extremities and the coding region has two genes partially overlapping orfA and orfAB, coding the transposase (OrfAB) and a regulatory protein (OrfA). 
A particular insertion sequence may be named according to the form ISn, where n is a number (e.g. IS1, IS2, IS3, IS10, IS50, IS911, etc.); this is not the only naming scheme used, however. Although insertion sequences are usually discussed in the context of prokaryotic genomes, certain eukaryotic DNA sequences belonging to the family of Tc1/mariner transposable elements may be considered to be insertion sequences. 

 
In addition to occurring autonomously, insertion sequences may also occur as parts of composite transposons; in a composite transposon (also known as a "complex transposon"), two insertion sequences flank one or more accessory genes, such as an antibiotic resistance gene (e.g. Tn10, Tn5). Nevertheless, there exist another sort of transposons, called unit transposons, that do not carry insertion sequences at their extremities (e.g. Tn7).

MTV Unplugged: Korn is the release of Korn that will be on sale on March 6, 2007. Their performance took set in MTV studios in Times Square, New York City on December 9, 2006 to a crowd of around 50-60 people. It marks Korn's second ever televised acoustic performance, with the first being on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! in July.

The show will be broadcasted online on MTV.com on February 24, 2007 and on television in America, Europe and Asia on March 2, 2007.

The exclusive acoustic set had the participation of other big-name artists including The Cure and Amy Lee, the lead singer of Evanescence. 

Virgin Records have confirmed the first single from the album will be "Freak on a Leash". The single initially was set to appear on radiostations on January 12, 2007, but its release was postponed to February 5. The video for the single was premiered on January 25, 2007  on three music channels: MTV, MTV2, and MTVU (The latter also put the video on its website for streaming). 

On January 17, MTV and Virgin Records postponed the album's release from February 20 to March 6. Also one song from the original show, "Dirty", has been cut from the original tracklist because of poor quality according to post that Jonathan Davis has made on the official Korn forum.

Richard Gibbs comments on the album.

On December 24, 2006 Richard Gibbs has made following statement on his message board:

About a month or so ago my pal Jonathan asked me to music direct/arrange Korn's appearance on MTV Unplugged. We videotaped at MTV's studios in Times Square two weeks ago and we are currently mixing that cd as well here at the Woodshed, yours truly at the producing helm again. For this project I added four celli, two basses, two cimbassos, two bass/contrabass trombonists, a saw player, a glass harmonica player, choir bells, and a six person taiko ensemble to Korn. Plus The Cure sat in for a mashup and Amy Lee (from Evanescence) sang along on Freak on a Leash. Fairly awesome.

Fecundity, derived from the word fecund, generally refers to the ability to reproduce.  In biology and demography, fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an organism or population, measured by the number of gametes (eggs), seed set or asexual propagules.  Fecundity is under both genetic and environmental control, and is the major measure of fitness. Fecundation is another term for fertilisation. 

Fecundity is important and well studied in the field of population ecology. Fecundity can increase or decrease in a population according to current conditions and certain regulating factors. For instance, in times of hardship for a population such as a lack of food, juvenile and eventually adult fecundity has been shown to decrease. 

Fecundity has also been shown to increase in ungulates with relation to warmer weather.

In the philosophy of science, fecundity refers to the ability of a scientific theory to open new lines of theoretical inquiry.

Arthur Millett (21 April 1874, Pittsfield, Maine - 24 February 1952, Los Angeles, California) was an early American motion picture actor whose career was at its height in the silent film era. 


Millett was signed into film relatively late in life aged 40 in 1914 but immediately work began to pick up. His first film the Lost Treasure was released in 1914. In 1915 he starred in films such as the Coals of Fireand the The Law of the Wilds working with prolific actors such as Harry von Meter
and Vivian Rich.

Miller starred in a total of 116 film in his career although with the advent of sound is career declined significantly with the majority of the roles in his 60 or so films after 1927 actually left uncredited.

He retired from film in 1940.

<doc id="1624448" title="German Visa Affair 2005" nonfiltered="706" processed="698" dbindex="450712">



The visa affair is the name given by German newspapers to the controversy which arose in early 2005 over a change of procedure of issuing visas to foreign nationals seeking to enter Germany from Eastern European non-EU states. Apparently, the new visa policy, in place since 2000, willingly discarded essential safeguards against abuses such as illegal immigration and human trafficking in favour of speeding up the issuing process for tourist visas. The affair prompted the resignation of then responsible Minister of State Ludger Volmer of the Green party from his roles in the Bundestag foreign affairs committee and as foreign affairs spokesperson of his party and severely damaged the reputation of his party colleague, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.



 Background .
1999/2000.
In 1999 the German embassy in Kiev, Ukraine alone issued more than 150,000 visas for Germany. Long queues formed in front of the embassy. Applicants reported that Ukrainian security personnel demanded DM 100 to 500 (¤50 - 250) from applicants to get ahead in the queue.  

At the beginning of 2000, the Minister of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ludger Volmer, issued a decree (known as "Volmer's Decree"), which extended the powers of the individual embassies in deciding about visa applications. The decree aimed at making travel to Germany easier. When in doubt, the application was to be decided in favour of the applicant.

At the same time, visa applications directly at travel agencies were introduced. This regulation was opposed by the Federal Bundesgrenzschutz (Border Guard) as well as by the Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Crime Agency), because they feared that it would also lead to easier migration into Germany for criminals. They cited a criminal court decision against the manager of a travel agency who organized illegal migration into Germany. The "tourists" went underground, became prostitutes or left Germany for other countries of the European Union.

In March 9, 2000, the Minister of the Interior, Otto Schily (SPD) wrote a letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joschka Fischer, saying that he saw the "Volmer's Decree" as a violation of the Aliens Act as well as of the Schengen Treaty. As of 2005, it is not clear if Schily intervened further, or if not, why not.

2001 - 2004.
On May 2, 2001 embassies worldwide were advised to accept the Carnet de Touriste travel insurance introduced by Helmut Kohl's CDU in 1995.  These insurance documents covered medical costs incurred abroad as well as any costs resulting from deportation. They were accepted in place of a written guarantee by a German citizen to prove that the visa applicant could finance his stay and his return home.

The German Automobile Club (ADAC) sold between 120,000 and 150,000 of these insurance documents, the Allianz insurance company sold more than 35,000, and the ITREC GmbH company more than 31,000. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also advised the embassies to accept similar travel insurance documents from the Reiseschutz AG, owned by private entrepreneur Kübler. The press claims this played an important role in the smuggling of people into Germany. The Ministry of the Interior was informed about this by the Federal Crime Agency (Bundeskriminalamt).

In a trial against Anatoli Barg, the Cologne criminal court claimed that the "Volmer's Decree", the acceptance of travel insurance documents instead of guarantors or proof of credit-worthiness and the applications for visas at travel agencies had led to mass human trafficking. In the verdict, this was called "a cold putsch against the law".

In July, 2001, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prevented applications for visas at travel agencies from October 1, 2001. Instead of going to a travel agency, once more every applicant had to go to the visa department in an embassy. However, it was assumed that a travel insurance document sufficed as proof of the applicant's credit-worthiness.

From January 29, 2002 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decreed that it was possible to buy and sell travel insurance documents directly in foreign countries. It is said in the press that this increased the problems in Kiev and that traders sold travel insurance documents for as much as $1,000.

On February 8, 2002 the German ambassador in Kiev reported that the embassy was flooded with applicants proving their credit-worthiness with travel insurance documents.

From April 2003, travel insurance documents were not accepted any longer. On October 28, 2004, the "Volmer's Decree" was revised. Once more, applicants' credit-worthiness had to be examined.

2005.
On January 20, 2005 the first meeting of the Commission of Inquiry was held in the German Bundestag. This commission -- a kind of judicial hearing -- was set up with the votes of the opposition parties CDU and CSU. The CDU was represented by Eckart von Klaeden. It is assumed that Joschka Fischer will have to make a statement before the commission; the exact time is still in discussion.

On February 12, 2005 Ludger Volmer retired as the Speaker for Foreign Affairs of the Green faction in the Bundestag, after the media criticized his work as a consultant for the company Synthesis GmbH, which worked for the Bundesdruckerei, producing identity cards, banknotes and other secure documents.

For the first time in over six years, in February, 2005 opinion polls did not show Joschka Fischer in the first place in the popularity vote. Instead, the leading position in the popularity vote went to the Christian Democratic Ministerpräsident (Premier) of Lower Saxony, Christian Wulff, with Fischer coming in second.

On March 22, 2005 the media reported that the federal chancellery had been informed about a dispute between Otto Schily and Joschka Fischer about visa politics as early as March, 2000. It was said that Chancellor Gerhard Schröder himself was not informed.

On March 26, 2005 Eckart von Klaeden called for Joschka Fischer to tell the truth before the elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. The CDU/CSU tried to force a statement by Fischer. If that works, a statement by Fischer is to be expected in mid-April to mid-May.

On March 31, 2005 the media reported that Fischer would speak before the Inquiry Commission in mid-April, earlier than previously expected.    The testimony of SPD minister of the interior Otto Schily is currently scheduled for June.

In April 2005 the media reported that there were difficulties in 2004. Fischer claimed the difficulties were resolved in mid-2004. Eckart von Klaeden said on the main German television channel ZDF that the Commission of Inquiry wanted to investigate the differing statement of Mr. Fischer in March 2005. On April 21, the Commission of Inquiry heard Ludger Volmer and his predecessor, Günther Pleuger. This Commission of Inquiry hearing (duration: more than 12 hours) was the first such hearing broadcasted by television (and was watched by more than 400,000 people). The second such hearing was the April 25 hearing of Joschka Fischer in the Commission of Inquiry (duration: 14 hours, viewed by 700,000 viewers alone at the "Phoenix" TV network, a 10.5% quota). Fischer said that he is political responsible, that many details cannot be remembered by him, and that he would have acted earlier if he would have been informed earlier. He also told about new monitoring mechanisms implemented in the Auswärtiges Amt. After the hearing, members of the CDU/CSU continued to ask for Fischers retirement, whereas members of SPD and The Greens said that Fischer performed well and that the CDU/CSU members in the commission were not able to show evidence for their accusations. 

May 2005: The German ambassador to Ukraine said the visa policies of Fischer were lax and eased the application of visas. He also said that the Volmer Decree unmotivated the employees at the embassy.

June 2, 2005: The Commission of Inquiry was adjourned today after a short session of only 30 minutes. The commission called an end to the hearing of evidence with the majority of its SPD/The Greens members. CDU and FDP on the other hand are likely to appeal to the Constitutional Court should this matter be dropped permanently. Some ministers, who were due to appear before the commission (e.g. Otto Schily was summoned for 8 July; or others like Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the Federal Chancellory), will not be questioned according to today's events. Apparently, the work of the commission is cut short by the widely anticipated call for a General Election in late summer (most probably on 18 September 2005).

June 15, 2005: In a provisional ruling today, the Constitutional Court considered the end of the hearings of evidence, as mentioned above on June 2, as unconstitutional and ordered the Commission of Inquiry to continue with its timetable as planned as long as the Federal Diet isn't dissolved due to the expected call for a snap election later this summer. This would mean the cancelled hearings of ministers like Mr. Schily (Minister of the Interior) and Mr. Steinmeier (Minister of State of the Federal Chancellory) will most likely take place after all.

The Cray T3E was Cray Research's second-generation massively parallel supercomputer architecture, launched in 1995.  Like the previous Cray T3D It was a fully distributed memory machine using a 3D torus topology interconnection network. The T3E initially used the DEC Alpha 21164 (EV5) microprocessor and was designed to scale from 8 to 2176 Processing Elements (PEs).  Each PE had between 64 MB and 2 GB of DRAM and a 6-way interconnect router with a payload bandwidth of 480 MB/s in each direction.  Unlike many other MPP systems, including the T3D,  the T3E was fully self-hosted and ran the UNICOS/mk distributed operating system with a GigaRing I/O subsystem integrated into the torus for network, disk and tape I/O.

The original T3E (retrospectively known as the T3E-600) had a 300 MHz processor clock. Later variants, using the faster 21164A (EV56) processor,  comprised the T3E-900 (450 MHz), T3E-1200 (600 MHz), T3E-1200E (with improved memory and interconnect performance) and T3E-1350 (675 MHz). The T3E was available in both air-cooled (AC) and liquid-cooled (LC) configurations. AC systems were available with 16 to 128 user PEs, LC systems with 64 to 2048 user PEs.

A 1480-processor T3E-1200 was the first supercomputer to achieve a performance of more than 1 teraflops running a computational science application, in 1998 .

AFP-675 (Air Force Program-675) was a Space Shuttle experiment package that was carried into orbit on Discovery as part of STS-39.

AFP-675 consisted of six experiment packages mounted on a pallet in the Discovery's cargo bay.  The total weight of the package was 5,080 kilograms (11,200 lb). The objectives of the project were:


 To obtain data in several wavelength regions to support the development of Department of Defense (DOD) systems;
 To validate technologies for DOD applications;
 To validate the use of man as an autonomous experimenter in space;
 To demonstrate the cost effectiveness of performing DOD experiments on reusable systems.


The experiments.

Cryogenic Infrared Radiance Instrumentation for Shuttle.
The Cryogenic Infrared Radiance Instrumentation for Shuttle (CIRRIS 1A) experiment was designed to measure the spectral, spatial, and temporal properties of the Earth's limb (edge).  The primary instruments in this experiment were a Michelson spatial interferometer and a spatial radiometer.  Infrared radiation was collected through a cryogenically cooled telescope that was controlled from the flight deck. The principal investigator (PI) for the instrument was Dr. Robert R. O'Neil of the Phillips Laboratory.

Far Ultraviolet Cameras.
The Far Ultraviolet Cameras experiment was to capture imagery and photometry of naturally occurring and man-made emission phenomena such as airglow and diffuse aurora.  Secondary missions were to study interplanetary and interstellar objects (such as comets and stars) and to make atmospheric density measurements by stellar occultations.  The instrument consisted of two imaging cameras and a low-light-level TV camera mounted on the same base.  Like CIRRIS, they were controlled from the flight deck.  Dr. George R. Carruthers, then working for the United States Naval Research Laboratory, was the PI for this experiment.

Uniformly Redundant Array.
The Uniformly Redundant Array conducted a technology demonstration of coded aperture imaging in space and the capability to form images without stabilization.  The instrument was a wide field-of-view, photon-counting imaging device. Edward E. Fenimore of the Los Alamos National Laboratory was PI for this experiment.

Gamma Ray Advanced Detector.
GRAD was another technology demonstration program to test the suitability of bismuth germanate in gamma-ray detectors, the suitability of n-type, high-purity germanium gamma-ray detectors for space, the performance of an advanced gamma-ray spectrometer and to study the gamma ray background around the shuttle, as well as the gamma-ray spectrum of the sun and the Galactic Center.  The instrument is non-steerable and is pointed by moving the Shuttle.  Dr. C.   Rester from the University of Florida was the PI.

Horizon Ultraviolet Program.
The Horizon Ultraviolet Program demonstrated the ability to measure the spatial and spectral characteristics of the Earth's horizon in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength. The sensor was an Ebert-Fastie spectrometer telescope. F. S. Leblanc of the Phillips Laboratory was PI.

Quadrupole Ion Neutral Mass Spectrograph.
The Quadrupole Ion Neutral Mass Spectrograph was designed to support the CIRRIS 1A experiment by providing positive ion and neutral contaminant species identifications, concentrations, and temporal variabilities. The sensor package was made up of an electron impact ion source, an ion-focusing grid system, a set of quadrupole rods, and an electron multiplier.  Dr. Edmond   Tryczinski of Phillips Laboratory was the PI.

The Kennebec River is a river, 150 mi (240 km) long, in the state of Maine in the northeastern United States. It rises in Moosehead Lake in northern Maine and flows southward past the cities of Madison, Skowhegan, Waterville, the state capital Augusta, and the shipbuilding center of Bath. Near its mouth, it is joined by the Androscoggin River, at Merrymeeting Bay, a 16 mi (26 km) long freshwater, tidal bay.  Ocean tides affect the river height as far north as Augusta.  Tributaries of the Kennebec River include the Dead River, Carrabassett River, Sandy River, and Sebasticook River.

The river was explored by Samuel de Champlain in 1604 and 1605. In 1607, the Popham Colony, the first English colony in New England, was founded near its mouth. The river, then known as the Sagadahoc River, also marked the northern border of the 1622 land patent of the Province of Maine granted to Ferdinando Gorges and John Mason. The Virginia of Sagadahoc, the first oceangoing vessel built in the New World by English-speaking shipwrights, was launched into the river. 

Hundreds of wooden and steel vessels have since been launched on the Kennebec, particularly in Bath, the so-called City of Ships. The sole remaining shipyard is the Bath Iron Works, one of the few yards still building warships for the United States Navy.

Prior to the industrial era, the river contained many anadromous fish, in particular the Atlantic Salmon. The exploiting of hydroelectric power in the region reduced the runs of such fish. The removal of dams on the river has been a controversial local issue in recent years. The removal of the Edwards Dam in 1999 has led to increased anadromous activity on the river.

The river drains a total area of 5,870 square miles (15,200 km ), and on average discharges nearly six billion (5,893 million) U.S. gallons per day into Merrymeeting Bay at a rate of 9,111 cubic feet per second (258 m /s).  The United States government maintains three river flow gages on the Kennebec river.  The first is at The Forks, Maine () where the rivershed is 1,590 square miles.  Flow here has ranged from 32,900 to 161 cubic feet per second.  The second is at Bingham, Maine () where the rivershed is 2,715 square miles. Flow here has ranged from 65,200 to 110 cubic feet per second.  The third is at North Sidney, Maine () where the rivershed is 5,403 square miles.  Flow here has ranged from 232,000 to 1,160 cubic feet per second.  Two additional river stage gages (no flow data) are in Augusta, Maine () and Gardiner, Maine () - both of these gage heights are affected by ocean tides.

Prior to damming, the river was navigable by ships.  In the winter it was possible to go as far north as Brunswick, ME, and in the summer as far as Waterville, ME.  The founder of Colby College sailed his sloop, Hero, up to Waterville where he decided to found the college.

In Greek mythology, Achilles, also Akhilleus or Achilleus  (Ancient Greek ) was a hero of the Trojan War, the central character and greatest warrior of Homer's Iliad, which takes for its theme, not the War of Troy in its entirety, but specifically the Wrath of Achilles. 

He is known for being the most 'handsome' of the heroes assembled at Troy, as well as the fleetest. Central to his myth is his relationship with Patroclus, characterized in different sources as deep friendship or love.

Birth.
Achilles was the son of the mortal Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Phthia (southeast Thessaly), and the sea nymph Thetis. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus the fire-bringer prophesied that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed to Peleus.

As with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternate version of the above events. The tale goes that Zeus tried to have an affair with Thetis, but Thetis was so loyal to Hera that she coldly rejected him. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry Peleus, as he was as near to an immortal as she was ever going to get.

According to the incomplete poem "Achilleis", written by Statius in the first century AD, and to no other sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx. However, she forgot to wet the heel she held him by, leaving him vulnerable at that spot. (See Achilles' heel, Achilles' tendon.) It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage. 

However no source before Statius makes any reference to this invulnerability.
The same Homer in the Iliad, to the contrary, mentions Achilles being wounded. (In Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood.")
Also in the Greek poems in which we can find description of the hero's death, Kùpria (unknown author), Aithiopis by Arctinus of Miletus, Ilias Mikrà by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou pèrsis by Arctinus of Miletus, there is no trace of any reference to his invulnerability or his famous heel; and in the pictures of that age presenting Achilles' death the arrow (in many cases arrows) hit him on the body.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur, on Mt. Pelion, to be raised.

Achilles in the Trojan War.


The very first two lines of the Iliad read:
;
;

Rage sing, goddess, the rage of Achilles, the son of Peleus,
the destructive rage that brought countless griefs upon the Achaeans...

Achilles is the only mortal to experience consuming rage (menis). His anger is at some times wavering, at other times absolute. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the story.

Cycnus of Colonae.
According to traditions related by Plutarch and the Byzantine scholar John Tzetzes, once the Greek ships arrived in Troy, Achilles fought and killed Cycnus of Colonae, a son of Poseidon. Cycnus was invulnerable, except for his head.

Troilus.
According to Dares Phrygius' Account of the Destruction of Troy , while Troilus, the youngest son of Priam and Hecuba (who some say was fathered by Apollo), was watering his horses at the Lion Fountain outside the walls of Troy, Achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty (whose "loveliness of form" was described by Ibycus as being like "gold thrice refined"). The youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of Apollo. Achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god's own altar. At the time, Troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday, and the legend goes that if Troilus had lived to be twenty, Troy would have been invincible.

The Iliad.



Homer's Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave, her father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, begged Agamemnon to return her to him.  Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks.  The prophet Calchas correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chyrsies must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' slave Briseis be brought to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis) and at the urging of Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his Myrmidons alongside the other Greek forces.

As the battle turned against the Greeks, Nestor declared that had Agamemnon not angered Achilles, the Trojans would not be winning and urged Agamemnon to appease Achilles. Agamemnon agreed and sent Odysseus and two other chieftans to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles stubbornly refused and urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

Eventually, however, hoping to retain glory despite his absence from the battle, Achilles prayed to his mother Thetis, asking her to plead with Zeus to allow the Trojans to push back the Greek forces. 
The Trojans, led by Hector, subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Achilles consented to Patroclus (sometimes considered Achilles' lover) leading the Myrmidons into battle, though Achilles would remain at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

 Hector versus Achilles . 
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his friend and held many funeral games in his honor.  His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded Hephaestus to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor included the Shield of Achilles, described in great detail by the poet.



Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.  Achilles even got in a fight with the river god Scamander who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed.  The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by Hera and Hephaestus.  Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet.  Finally Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, Deiphobus, persuaded Hector to fight face to face. Achilles got his vengeance, killing Hector with a blow to the neck.  He then tied Hector's body to his chariot and dragged it around the battlefield for thirteen days.

With the assistance of the god Hermes, Priam, Hector's father, went to Achilles's tent and convinced Achilles to permit him to allow Hector his funeral rites.  The final passage in the Iliad is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy is just a matter of time.

Memnon.
Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles's closest companion was Nestor's son Antilochus.  When Memnon of Ethiopia killed Antilochus, Achilles is once again drawn out onto the battlefield to seek revenge. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) is also the son of a goddess (like Achilles). Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliads description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic Aethiopis, which was composed after the Iliad, possibly in the 7th century BC. The Aethiopis is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. Quintus of Smyrna gives a short narration of Memnon's death.

Penthesilea, and the death of Achilles.
  

Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the Amazonian warrior queen Penthesilea.

As predicted by Hector with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by Paris   either by an arrow (to the heel according to Statius), or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting Polyxena, a princess of Troy.  In some versions, the god Apollo guided Paris' arrow.

Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield. His bones are mingled with those of Patroclus, and funeral games are held. He was represented  in the lost Trojan War epic of Arctinus of Miletus as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube (see below). 

Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles.

The fate of Achilles' armor.
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax (Achilles' older cousin). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles and the most deserving to receive it. Odysseus won. Ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades; he started killing cattle or sheep, thinking in his madness that they were Greek soldiers. He then killed himself.

Achilles and Patroclus.

Achilles' relationship with Patroclus is a key aspect of his myth.  Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.  In the Iliad, it is clear that the two heroes have a deep and extremely meaningful friendship, but the evidence of a romantic or sexual element is equivocal.  Commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures.  Thus, in 5th century BC Athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as pederastic.  Contemporary readers are more likely to interpret the two heroes either as non-sexual "war buddies" or as an egalitarian homosexual couple.

The cult of Achilles in antiquity.

There was an archaic cult of Achilles on the White Island, Leuce, in the Black Sea off the modern coasts of Romania and Ukraine, with a temple and an oracle which survived into the Roman period.

In the lost epic Aithiopis, a continuation of the Iliad attributed to Arktinus of Miletos,  Achilles  mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.

Pliny's Natural History (IV.27.1) mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (Insula Achillis tumulo eius viri clara), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from Peuce by the Danube Delta, and the temple there. Pausanias has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles  temple and his statue  (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeology done on the island.

Pomponius Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister (De situ orbis, II, 7). And the Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called Leuce "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor  (Orbis descriptio, v. 541, quoted in Densu ianu 1913).

The Periplus of the Euxine Sea gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus  honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles  temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles  honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles  oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships . (quoted in Densu ianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in Antiquity, not only along the sealanes of the Pontic Sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as Pontarches the lord and master of the Pontic (Black) Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (Stephanus Byzantinus), Achilleios in Laconia (Pausanias, III.25,4) Nicolae Densu ianu (Densu ianu 1913) even thought he recognized Achilles in the name of Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law."

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.  Ammianus Marcellinus (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (aquae) on the island.

The cult of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu.
In the region of Gastouri (        ) to the south of the city of Corfu Greece, Empress of Austria Elisabeth of Bavaria also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: Achilleion (         ). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the Trojan war.

The name of Achilles.
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of  (akhos) "grief" and  (Laos) "a people, tribe, nation, etc." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of kleos (glory, usually glory in war).

Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean a corps of soldiers. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

Centuries after Homer, his name was turned into the female form of Achillia, attested on  as the name of a female gladiator fighting 'Amazonia'.  Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea, but give it an extra twist of Achilles being 'played' by a man.

Other stories about Achilles.
 
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros.  There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter Deidamia, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Trojan campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

In Homer's Odyssey, there is a passage in which Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. This has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life, but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes. 

Post-Homeric literature explores a pederastic interpretation of the love between Achilles and Patroclus. By the fifth and fourth centuries, the deep   and arguably ambiguous   friendship portrayed in Homer blossomed into an unequivocal erotic love affair in the works of Aeschylus, Plato, and Aeschines, and seems to have inspired the enigmatic verses in Lycophron's third century Alexandra that claim Achilles slew Troilus in a matter of unrequited love.

The kings of the Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son. Alexander the Great, son of the Epiran princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy.

Achilles fought and killed the Amazon Helene. Some also said he married Medea, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades   as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' Argonautica. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive Briseis.

Achilles in Greek tragedy.

The Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title Achilleis by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris punctures his heel. Extant fragments of Myrmidons and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.  

Another lost play by Aeschylus, The Myrmidons, focused on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus; only a few lines survive today.

The tragedian Sophocles also wrote a play with Achilles as the main character, The Lovers of Achilles. Only a few fragments survive.

<doc id="381007" title="Professor Chronotis" nonfiltered="717" processed="709" dbindex="450723">

Professor Urban Chronotis is a fictional character created by Douglas Adams. He originally appeared in the Doctor Who serial Shada, starring Tom Baker and Lalla Ward. However, since the filming of the latter was never completed due to industrial action, the public was not introduced to him until the publication of Adams' novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency in 1987. 

An incomplete version of Shada was eventually released on VHS, and in 2003 it was remade as an animated webcast by Big Finish Productions for the BBC. Professor Chronotis was played by Denis Carey in the unaired 1980 version of Shada, and by James Fox in the webcast remake, which was also released as an audio play on CD by Big Finish.



Chronotis   or "Reg" as he is known   holds the post of Regius Professor of Chronology at Cambridge University. He is also a Fellow of the fictional St. Cedd's College, Cambridge, where he has resided for many centuries. In the Shada version, Chronotis is a retired Time Lord and old friend of the Doctor, living out his remaining centuries in academic seclusion. Owing to repeated time travel and advanced age, he is extremely forgetful and absent-minded. He often does not remember which time period he has travelled nor the reason why. Among other things, Reg has a liking for tea and silly jokes. It is also revealed during the course of Shada that Chronotis was a Time Lord criminal named Salyavin, who was imprisoned on and escaped from the prison planetoid Shada.

The Dirk Gently version of the character is almost identical to the Shada version, though the novel contains no references to Time Lords. Here Chronotis is so old and forgetful that he has no idea who or what he originally was, though he has vague memories of Cleopatra (who he claims wore outrageous earrings and reeked of cat food). His Chair of Chronology was created by mad king George III who was terrified that if time were to start flowing backwards, all the bad experiences of his life might recur. In fact, central to the book's theme are the three questions the King asked Reg upon his appointment; if one could travel through time, if there was a reason one thing happened after another, and if there was any way of stopping it. (The answers are, in order, yes, no and maybe, which leads to Dirk deducing the existence of the time machine as his associate, Richard, was only told about the second and third questions but given all three answers.) 

In both versions, Chronotis is a clandestine time-traveller, whose time machine (or TARDIS, as they are termed in Doctor Who) is disguised as his college rooms. 

In The End of the World the Doctor stated that his homeworld had been destroyed. Whether Chronotis was on Gallifrey at the time is unknown, but the Doctor also declared that no Time Lords, aside from himself, were left in the universe.

Teudebur of Alt Clut (or Teudebur map Beli) was the ruler of Alt Clut (the area around modern Dumbarton Rock),  in the early-to-mid eighth century (probably 722-52). According to the Harleian genealogies, he was the son of Beli II, his probable predecessor as king. Such information is confirmed by both the Irish and Welsh annals. We know from the Harleian genealogy that he was the father of Dumnagual III, one of his successors. His reign coincided with that of the illustrious Pictish king Óengus mac Fergusa (Onuist map Uurguist). The Annales Cambriae reports that in 750, the Britons defeated a Pictish army at Mocetauc (Mygedawc), in which, according to the Annals of Tigernach, Óengus' brother Talorgen was killed. Mygedawc is often identified with modern Mugdock, on the boundary between Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire, but this identity is by no means certain. The Annals of Tigernach, which styles him Taudar mac Bile, rí Alo Cluaide, put his death at 752, and for this reason, we can be certain Teudebur was the British king responsible for the British victory.

Horst Kopkow (November 29 1910 in Ortelsburg, Poland - October 1996 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany) was a Nazi Germany SS major who worked for German Security police and, after the war, was concealed by British intelligence so that they could use his knowledge in the Cold War.

During World War II, Kopkow served in German national security police headquarters in Berlin. He was responsible for counter-sabotage and counterespionage. In May 1942 SS general Reinhard Heydrich extended his responsibilities to include the capture of Soviet parachute agents in Czechoslovakia and Poland. After Heydrich's death in a Czech resistance attack, Kopkow's responsibilities were extended to include all allied parachute agents in the German Reich.

During the war, Kopkow's agents captured several hundred Soviet and British agents. Kopkow was informed and consulted over every capture, although he never left his headquarters in Berlin. One of his major efforts was the destruction of Red Orchestra and Rote Drei espionage networks. Security police also captured agents of MI6 and SOE. Kopkow authorized several hundred orders to execute the agents. This continued to the end of the war in 1945. His superiors rewarded him with medals. Kopkow also investigated the July Plot, an attempted assassination against Hitler.

At the end of the war, British military police arrested Kopkow in a Baltic village on May 29 1945. By that time he would have been implicated in 300 deaths of Allied agents. 

MI5 interrogated Kopkow heavily for the next four years to find out his methods against Soviet espionage. Kopkow cooperated and dictated notes to his former secretary Bertha Rose. British intelligence sheltered him from war crimes investigation and made him available only for three times in war crimes trials. They announced his death to War Crimes Group in London in January 1948.

According to partially declassified MI5 documents released 2004 in the British National Archives, MI6 hid Kopkow to use him for his own purposes. They released him in West Germany in 1949 or 1950 as a textile factory worker in the British occupation zone. Later he gave just two statements to the West German police when they were investigating the disappearance and death of Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller. 

Horst Kopkow died from pneumonia in a hospital in Gelsenkirchen 1996.

Robert ("Bobby") Peel (born February 12, 1857 in Leeds, died August 12, 1941 in Leeds) was a Yorkshire and England cricketer: a left-arm spinner who ranks as one of the finest bowlers of the 1890s. His record in Test matches, though flattered by the primitiveness of the pitches, is still remarkable. He was also a capable batsman, who once hit 210 not out (out of a record County Championship total of 887 against Warwickshire). However, he is well remembered for being the first player in Test cricket history to have been dismissed four times in succession without scoring (in 1894/1895).

Peel emerged in first-class cricket for Yorkshire in 1882 and quickly established himself as a skillful left-arm spin bowler with extraordinary accuracy of pitch and the ability to bowl a fast ball that obtained many wickets. His ability was considered so highly by 1884 that, even though he was relatively inexperienced, Alfred Shaw took him to Australia in 1884/1885, where he appeared in all three Tests. He took 21 wickets, but played disappointingly in the dry summer of 1885. Despite recovering his form, Peel did not play in the three 1886 Tests, but in 1887/1888 he played superbly at the Sydney Cricket Ground, taking nine wickets for 58 runs and being England's match-winner.

In the extremely wet summer of 1888, Peel took 100 wickets for the first time and, on a series of sticky wickets, took 24 wickets for less than eight runs each in three Tests against Australia, including 11 for 68 in the deciding match at Old Trafford. He accomplished many bowling feats that year, the most remarkable of which was 8 for 12 and 6 for 21 against Nottinghamshire. This saw Peel named among the first batch of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1889 (it was actually titled Six Great Bowlers Of The Year).

In the following years, Peel took over 100 wickets every year, except in 1891 when he took only 99 (a disappointing record, given the exceptionally helpful pitches of the time and the wetness of that summer). Peel equalled his 1888 haul of 171 wickets in 1890, and came close to a thousand runs in 1889 and 1891, scoring in the former year 158 against Middlesex. However, owing to competition from bowlers such as Johnny Briggs, Peel did not make consistent appearances in the England Test team playing in only one out of three Tests in both 1890 and 1893. Whilst his batting declined somewhat for a few seasons between 1892 and 1895, Peel headed the first-class bowling averages in 1893 and took a career-best 180 wickets in 1895, when after a slow start on much-improved wickets in very dry weather, his spin and guile made him almost unplayable when the weather broke up in July. His 15 for 50 against Somerset and 10 for 59 against Gloucestershire were both match-winning performances.

Meanwhile, Peel's excellent bowling on generally very hard and true Australian pitches in the tour of 1894/1895 had seemed to cement his place as the best slow bowler in the world. Though this tour is best remembered for his then-record four successive ducks, Peel did bat well on a couple of other occasions during a close and at times gruelling series.

The summer of 1896 saw Peel, aided by the remarkably rapid improvement in pitches that occurred during the 1890s, develop so much as a batsman that he hit three centuries during one of England's driest Mays on record. The excellent pitches did nullify his spin and his average at one point was twice his 1895 average, but he was as effective as ever when rain-affected pitches returned and, chosen because of a soft wicket for the last Test, he was so unplayable that Australia lost their first nine wickets for 25 runs.

However, in 1897, during a disappointing season by his own standards, Peel's behaviour saw him disciplined by the Yorkshire club's committee over disagreements concerning pay and other occasions when he had to be helped from the pitch. There is a famous story about him bowling in the wrong direction and even urinating on the pitch. These issues were never reconciled, and Peel, still bowling and batting well, never played county cricket again. In fact, apart from one match for an England XI in 1899, he never played first-class cricket again. Unlike the more sober Johnny Briggs, his main competitor for an England place, he lived a long life. Peel died on August 12, 1941.

Santokh means Contentment and is one of five virtues that is vigorously promoted by the Sikh Gurus. The other four qualities in the arsenal are: Truth (Sat), Compassion (Daya), Humility (Nimrata) and Love (Pyare). These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the Gurbani so that these virtues become a part of their mind.

Contentment is another very important virtue in Sikhism. Instead of constantly thinking of how to satisfy personal desires, Sikhs try to accept the circumstances of their lives and concentrate on acting in accordance with God s Will/Hukam. They try to remember that all aspects of life are a result of God s Will/Hukam. Contentment leads to freedom from care, fear and worry. It is a very important divine quality; it is a deep godly priceless jewel, which is acquired by those souls who move on the path of Sach Khand.

When all the desires vanish the state of contentment is reached, the state of  "Sat Santokh" is acquired. Desires are the reason for our sorrows and pains; its a such for an escape from these sorrows and pains. Fulfilling desires the person gets momentary happiness; unfulfilled desires bring disappointment. A continuous string of disappointments leads to depression and to mental and physical sicknesses.

Desires lead to mental and physical distortion of the mind; whereas contentment brings peace and calmness to the mind. This state of calmness and fulfilment brings us closer to the Almighty, because where there is complete peace in the mental state of the person, the mind can focus on the ultimate reality, the Akal Purakh.

 Gurbani .

  Dharma (religion) is the son of compassion; ;
Dhoul Dharam da-i-aa kaa poot. 
Contentment patiently holds the earth in its place. 
santokh thaap rakhi-aa jin soot. (SGGS Page 3 line 73)

 Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life.
sat santokh da-i-aa kamaavai ayh karnee saar. (SGGS Page 51 line 2072)

 Truth, contentment and intuitive peace and poise are obtained from the Bani, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ((3));
sach santokh sahj sukh banee pooray gur tay paavni-aa. ((3)) (SGGS Page 115 line 4670)

Henry Harnden (March 4, 1823   March 17, 1900) was an officer in the United States Army during the American Civil War. He led the Wisconsin troops who assisted a Michigan military company in the capture of Jefferson Davis. 

Harnden was born in Wilmington, Massachusetts. He ventured to sea early in his life, and moved to Wisconsin in 1852, taking up residence in the town of Sullivan, in Jefferson County. He later moved to Ripon, Wisconsin. 
He also spent many years in California. He fought in the Mexican-American War and was wounded on several occasions during the American Civil War.

Harnden enlisted in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry Regiment, Company D, as a private in July 1861, and rose through the ranks. He held the rank of captain from 1862 to 1864, major from 1864 to 1865 and, for a short time, lieutenant colonel. On March 13, 1865, he was brevetted to colonel and to brigadier general. On May 10, 1865, leading a detachment of three companies of the 1st Wisconsin, he assisted the 4th Michigan Cavalry (after an unfortunate initial friendly-fire engagement with that unit) in the capture of Jefferson Davis at Irwinville, Georgia.  

Harnden mustered out of the service in July 1865 and returned to Wisconsin, settling in Madison. He served one term in the State Assembly (1866), as well as U.S. Assesor (1867-1873), and U.S. Collector of Internal Revenue (1873-1883). In 1899, Harnden was Department Commander of the Wisconsin GAR until his death.

Harnden died of pneumonia at his home in Madison, Wisconsin, and was buried there in the historic Forest Hill Cemetery. He was survived by his widow and four children.

Due to the controversies surrounding the capture of Jefferson Davis, Harnden authored a short book, The Capture of Jefferson Davis, published in 1898.

Brian Hugh Warner (born January 5, 1969), better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson, is the lead singer of the industrial metal band  that bears his name. His stage name is formed from the names Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. Manson bears the honorary title of "Reverend" in Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, though how closely he follows the dogma is questionable. Nonetheless, the controversy this affiliation augmented has garnered him publicity which resulted in commercial success.

Biography.
Brian Warner was born in Canton, Ohio. He attended Heritage Christian School, but was soon turned off from Christianity, which he viewed as hypocritical and more concerned with instilling fear than virtue. He has stated that the Christian vision of the Apocalypse in particular had a lasting effect upon his outlook. After transferring to and later graduating from Canton's GlenOak High School, Warner moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida with his family. While living in Fort Lauderdale, he studied journalism and theater at Broward Community College , and became the assistant entertainment editor of BCC's student newspaper, the Observer.




Romance.

Manson has been linked to or involved with Melissa "Missi" Romero, Traci Lords, and Jenna Jameson. Jameson wrote about her sexual encounter with Manson in her autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale in which she noted him as being "enormously endowed". Manson was engaged to Rose McGowan, but their relationship ended around the time he became involved with burlesque dancer and fetish model Dita Von Teese. Manson photographed Von Teese for the December 2002 issue of Playboy.  Manson and Von Teese wed in December 2005 in the Irish home of friend Gottfried Helnwein.  Von Teese filed for divorce as of December 2006.


Marriage.
Manson and Dita Von Teese started dating on Manson's 32nd birthday, and Manson proposed three years later on 22 March 2004. On 3 December 2005 (court documents say 28 November) , the couple was married in a non-denominational ceremony at Gurteen Castle in Kilsheelan, County Tipperary, Ireland, the home of Gottfried Helnwein.  The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director and comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky. Dita Von Teese wore a royal purple silk taffeta gown by Vivienne Westwood, complete with train and petticoats worn over a Mr. Pearl couture corset, topped off by a tricorne hat by Stephen Jones, while Manson wore a John Galliano black silk taffeta tuxedo with velvet trim and a hat also crafted by Stephen Jones. They reportedly exchanged vows in front of approximately 60 guests, including burlesque dancer Catherine Delish, Lisa Marie Presley, Eric Szmanda, David Lynch, Jessicka and Christian Hejnal, and Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne. Vogue magazine ran a multiple-page feature on the wedding in its February 2006 issue. Just before his own wedding, Manson criticized Britney Spears's wedding to Kevin Federline, in which they celebrated by wearing personalized tracksuits: "If you're going to do something like getting married, it should have a sense of celebration to it. It should be grand and not in tracksuits!"

As of January 30,2007  Manson and Dita Von Teese reportedly split after him filing for divorce due to "irreconcilable differences" according to Von Teese.  ET.com along with People Magazine has claimed that Manson was having an extramarital affair with actress Evan Rachel Wood, which may or may not be the true cause of the split.  Manson's alcohol abuse and distant behaviour have also been cited as cause for the split. It has also been claimed that Manson was not aware of Von Teese's filing for divorce and moving out of their home at the time that the story was published, conceivably due to his reported stay in Paris, France.  Von Teese reportedly took their two cats and two dachshunds, Greta and Eva, with her when she left.  Manson is currently fighting for custody of the two cats.

Evan Rachel Wood attended the grand opening of Manson's new Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art and among the most notable artworks were two portraits of Evan. She will also co-star in his upcoming horror film ''.
 

Career.
In music.


Jessicka of the band Jack Off Jill was an early friend of Manson's, her band opened most of his South Florida shows. He not only produced most of the band's early recordings but also played guitar on the song My Cat. Manson also helped name the band.

In early 1993, after being instructed by his new label nothing/Interscope not to play any local shows, Manson formed Mrs. Scabtree. Scabtree was a side project between he and newly hired Jeordie White. Manson played drums, while White (dressed as a black woman) shared vocal duties with then girlfriend Jessicka from Jack Off Jill who wore a blonde wig. Mrs. Scabtree only played two shows in South Florida.

Manson has helped or provided full scores for several major motion pictures, although several of his pieces have been cut, and his name dropped from the credits. Some of his more notable soundtrack score contributions include From Hell,#da
0The Matrix and Resident Evil.

Manson appeared as a guest on rapper DMX's album Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood for the track "The Omen", produced by Swizz Beats, and has performed (with the rest of the band) on stage with Eminem as background music in the song "The Way I Am".

Manson sang vocals on "Break You Down" off of the Washington, DC-based industrial rock band Godhead's 2000 Years of Human Error album. This album is distinguished for being the only one released on Manson's vanity label Posthuman.


In film and television.

Manson made a cameo appearance as a doctor in the Murderdolls' music video "Dead in Hollywood", and also appears in the Nine Inch Nails music video "Starfuckers, Inc.", as well as "Gave Up"

His first appearance in a film was in the role of a pornographic actor in David Lynch's Lost Highway, in 1997.  He also had a minor role in former love interest Rose McGowan's 1998 film Jawbreaker and a supporting role in 2003's Party Monster.  Manson made a cameo appearance in a  in the BMW Films series (starring Clive Owen as the Driver), which featured James Brown as himself, and Gary Oldman as Satan. His most talked-about film cameo was in the Michael Moore political documentary Bowling for Columbine discussing the motivations of the perpetrators and allegations that his music was somehow a factor.  He played himself, in animated form, on an episode of the television series Clone High, in which he sang a song about nutrition and the food pyramid. Manson portrayed a psychotic drag queen named Christina in the movie Party Monster which is based on the events leading up to and the murder of Angel Melendez by the infamous Michael Alig of club kid fame.
He is featured prominently throughout Not Another Teen Movie, and covered the song Tainted Love for that movie.

His music is frequently featured on the show C.S.I.. The character on the show, Greg Sanders, is a big fan of Manson and the actor who plays him, Eric Szmanda is personal friends with Manson. 

Manson was featured in the 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, and is set to appear in Abelcain, directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Living Neon Dreams in 2005.  He will also be seen as a bartender in an upcoming vampire movie starring Lucy Liu called Rise.

In July 2005, Manson told Rolling Stone Magazine that he was shifting his focus from music to filmmaking - "I just don't think the world is worth putting music into right now. I no longer want to make art that other people--particularly record companies--are turning into a product. I just want to make art."
He is currently working on his directorial debut, , which was put on his website around the end of 2006. The film is said to feature special effects using a magician rather than computer-generated imagery.

In art.
Manson is also a watercolor painter. An exhibit for his art was held at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions on September 13, September 14, 2002 and also at the Hotel Lutecia, Paris on September 14, 2004 and the next day in Berlin. He contributed a piece to the West Memphis Three benefit exhibition at six spaces. Many of his paintings have sold for over $5,000; buyers include Jack Osbourne, Nicolas Cage, Dave Navarro, Andy Dick and Lisa Marie Presley. He has stated that a new book containing all his pieces of art work will be released in the near future, possibly 2006.

Manson opened his own gallery October 31, 2006 in Los Angeles. The gallery, The Celebritarian Corp. Gallery of Fine Art, opened with a showing of Manson's watercolors. 

In other areas.
Manson provided the voice of the alien Edgar in the 2005 first-person shooter video game Area 51, which also featured David Duchovny and Jeordie White. Marilyn Manson also appears (as himself) as a playable character in the video game Celebrity Deathmatch. Allegedly, the artist posed nude for photos prior to his rise to fame.  The pictures appeared in the March 1999 issue of Honcho.

Fallout with Trent Reznor.
One of his high-profile relationships, the defunct friendship with Trent Reznor, has been marked with mutual bitterness and perhaps vendetta. This started in the mid-'90s, when Manson was due to make a track that would appear on the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway but had been recorded instead by Reznor. In  an interview, Warner implicated Reznor as being responsible for the disappearance of the master recordings of Manson's first three albums.Since the late 90's, however, it seems the two rockers have patched their differences; as Manson also made an appearance in the video for the  Nine Inch Nails song "Starfuckers Inc." from the album The Fragile, released in 1999.

Fallout and departure of Twiggy Ramirez.
In May 2002 Twiggy Ramirez (real name Jeordie White) left the band, citing differences in perspective on the future of the band. He went on to play bass for A Perfect Circle and Nine Inch Nails. Manson has claimed in interviews that he and Twiggy are still close friends, while Jeordie maintains that he rarely speaks to Manson. In an interview in February of 2006 Twiggy stated he was willing to record an album with Marilyn Manson if the right conditions were met. In the Autumn of 2006, Manson and Twiggy were photographed together at numerous parties in Los Angeles, in amicable poses.

Fallout with John 5.
John 5's reasons for leaving Marilyn Manson are cited as being mutual, despite the mysterious nature of his sudden firing by Manson in 2004. At the time, some fans speculated that John's puritanical lifestyle (puritanical, that is, relative to the band's supposed reputation, with his strict refusal of drugs and alcohol being notable) was ultimately what resulted in his elimination, though this has never been proven. John continues to hold a deep respect for Manson, citing his skilled production style and his love for the band's music. John was already a fan of the band before joining in 1998. 

Lawsuits.
In a civil battery suit, David Diaz, a security officer from a concert in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 27, 2000, sued for $75,000 in a Minneapolis federal court. The federal court jury found in Manson's favor. 
In a civil suit presented by Oakland County, MI, Manson was charged with sexual misconduct against another security officer, Joshua Keasler, during a concert in Auburn Hills, Michigan on July 30, 2001. Oakland County originally filed assault & battery and criminal sexual misconduct charges, but the judge reduced the latter charge to misdemeanor disorderly conduct. Manson pleaded no contest to the reduced charges, paid a $4,000 fine, and later settled the lawsuit under undisclosed terms.

Trivia.
 In the 1990s, an Internet rumor spread stating Josh Saviano (who played 'Paul Pfeiffer' in 1980s drama The Wonder Years) grew up to become Marilyn Manson. As of 2007, Josh Savinio is a licensed attorney in New York. He has, however, commented on the rumor, and thinks it is neat people believe him to be in a goth band. ;

Contrary to what some may deem "common knowledge", Manson has not had any ribs removed for the purpose of autofellatio. "If I really got my ribs removed," he said in his autobiography, "I would have been busy sucking my own dick on The Wonder Years instead of chasing Winnie Cooper.";

<doc id="1080525" title="Foster and Partners" nonfiltered="735" processed="727" dbindex="450741">

Foster and Partners is a leading firm of architects in the United Kingdom. The practice is strongly associated with its founder, Norman Foster, now Lord Foster, and has constructed many high profile glass and steel, high-tech buildings around the world. In particular they are known for their design of airport buildings.

Established by Norman Foster as Foster Associates in 1967 shortly after he left Team 4, the company was renamed 'Foster and Partners' in the 1990s to more accurately reflect the influence of the other lead architects. 

Senior partners.

The practice is an umbrella for some seven hundred architects, project specialists and support team, the main office is laid out in an open plan egalitarian style with all architects working at a similar desk irrespective of seniority, However, as of 2006 the lead partners are:
Norman Foster;
Spencer de Grey;
David Nelson;
Graham Phillips;
Mark Sutcliffe;
Stefan Behling;
Grant Booker;
Nigel Dancey;
Brandon Haw;
Paul Kalkhoven;
Mouzhan Majidi;
Gerard Evendan;

Another highly influential partner for most of the practice's history was Ken Shuttleworth who was a key team member in some of their most famous designs, including: 30 St Mary Axe, the Greater London Authority Building, Hong Kong International Airport and the Commerzbank Tower in Frankfurt. 

Shuttleworth's position as a team member meant that he was at the time more than happy to let the firm rightly take full credit   and in truth these highly technical buildings require the input from a large team of individuals and no one person can take all the credit, However at the end of 2003, after nearly 30 years of work, Shuttleworth raised his personal profile significantly and then left Foster and Partners to establish his own practice, MAKE.

Selected projects.
Major projects, by year of completion are:
 Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK (1978);
 HSBC Tower (1986);

<doc id="284525" title="Chicken Run" nonfiltered="736" processed="728" dbindex="450742">



Chicken Run is a 2000 stop-motion animation film made by the Aardman Animations studios (which produced the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit films).

Background.
Chicken Run tells the humorous story of a band of chickens who seek escape from their coop before their owners, the unambitious yet inconveniently oafish and suspicious egg farmer Mr. Tweedy and his greedy, overbearing wife, make them all into chicken pies. The film is an homage to the World War II prison films of the 1950s and 1960s (particularly The Great Escape, Stalag 17, and Escape of the Birdmen), but it alludes to numerous other films, including Braveheart, the Indiana Jones films, and Star Trek. (Stalag 17 and the latter 3 films or film series were all released by Paramount Pictures, currently sister studio to DreamWorks after Viacom bought the latter in 2005.)

The star roles in the movie are those of Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha), a hen who has absolute faith that the chickens can fly out of the coop if only they train hard enough, and Rocky Rhodes (voiced by Mel Gibson), a rooster whom Ginger believes can fly, but who keeps the secret of his flightlessness from her for much of the film.  
Mrs. Tweedy (voiced by Miranda Richardson) is the nefarious, grasping farm wife whose exasperation at low profits from egg sales leads her to reinvent her farm as a chicken pie factory, while her husband does all he can to prevent the chickens from (as he rightly believes they are) escaping.

The film proved a success with both children and adults, and showed that Peter Lord and Nick Park had the ability to handle the technical and writing challenges posed by a feature film, and thereby serving as a test bed for the 2005 movie outing for Wallace and Gromit, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.

Summary.

The movie opens in a POW camp-like chicken farm in England. The farmer, Mr. Tweedy, is on his watch with his dogs checking the locks, while a small group of chickens stealthily attempt to escape from the enclosure. Unfortunately, Tweedy catches on and a lone chicken, Ginger - the ringleader - is captured and thrown in a coal bin, Tweedy snarling that "No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!"

The farm is run by Malica (or possibly Melissa) Tweedy and her suspicious hen-pecked husband. Day and night pass by and the farmer takes the eggs while his nefarious wife checks progress. All the while, Ginger makes new plans to escape which all end in failure (The opening credits are made of subsequent failed escape attempts). A new day begins and all the chickens stand for roll call while Fowler, a male rooster, babbles on about "his old RAF days". The wife, Mrs. Tweedy, checks all the chickens, marking down the eggs they have laid. One chicken, Edwina, hasn't laid any in a week and is taken inside a shed. Ginger sneaks to see what happens, as Mrs. Tweedy swings up an axe and decapitates Edwina -- but the viewers see this only as shadows.

But the chickens aren't fazed. Ginger prepares a new plan to go over the fence, calling in two rats, Nick and Fetcher, to sneak in new stuff. Inside the house, the humans have eaten Edwina and Mrs. Tweedy angrily looks over the amount of eggs and wants a new way to make money. An ad catches her eye about a giant pie machine, with a small cartoon character shouting "I'M RICH!". Mr. Tweedy is keeping watch outside and suspects the chickens' plot, but Mrs. Tweedy tells him that all of this ridiculous notion of escaping chickens is all in his head. The idea about going over the fence doesn't go well with the other chickens, but Ginger reminds them about Edwina. 

Outside, a huge blast is heard, a rooster flies over the fence, and crash lands inside the camp. The chickens eagerly hide him and he introduces himself as Rocky Rhodes, a "lone free ranger" from America. (This is a double pun on The Lone Ranger and free range, a method of farming husbandry.) Then Ginger asks him if he can teach them how to fly, but Rocky isn't so thrilled at the idea. Eventually, he reconciles when he sees the circus has come back to take him.

The next day, training begins very bizarrely as Rocky seems to have no idea what he's doing. Eventually the day ends without a single chicken making it off the ground. A huge "Poultry Products" truck appears and unloads vast amounts of equipment. Mrs. Tweedy explains the idea to her husband and the farm will now officially become a full automated factory. 

Meanwhile, Mac (a Scottish chicken, who is a bit of an egghead genius) looks over her notes and concludes that chickens simply weren't built for flying. Ginger confronts Rocky about their poor progress and Mac deduces that they require thrust. Ginger warns Rocky that if they do not see progress, the deal is off and they will reveal his presence to the farmers.

The next morning, Rocky gets a cable wire and prepares to sling-shot the chickens over the fence, but that doesn't work out. Roll call begins and Babs (a knitting-obsessed chicken) hasn't laid any eggs, focusing more on the flying. Instead of chopping her, Mrs. Tweedy measures her waistline and orders Mr. Tweedy to double their food rations. Ginger stops them from eating and tells them that the farmers are deliberately fattening them up to kill them all in one stroke. To help out for once, Rocky manages to bring them a radio to cheer them up, which leaves the entire coop dancing to the song "Flip, Flop, Fly". Rocky's bandages fall off and Ginger eagerly announces that he can finally show them how to fly tomorrow. But before he can tell her he can't really fly, the power goes out. Outside, the pie machine has completed construction and Mr. Tweedy brings Ginger in as the first victim and Rocky breaks her out, surviving the innards and sabotaging the machine. Fowler gives him an RAF medal and apologizes for doubting him. Both Ginger and Rocky share a tender moment on the roof, overlooking the fields.

The following morning, all the chickens eagerly await the flying demonstration. Ginger goes to wake Rocky, but he's gone, leaving his RAF medal. She finds a torn piece of Rocky's promotional poster and slowly adds it, revealing her horror to everyone. Completed, the poster shows a cannon; Rocky could never fly at all.

Their plans shot and their hopes shattered, Ginger gives up and denies any chance of escaping. The whole farm starts fighting. Ginger finally asks Fowler what the RAF is. Fowler tells them it is the "Royal Air Force" and shows them pictures of the airplane he flew in. Filled with hope again, the chickens still plan to fly, but now by building the huge plane. Even the rats help out as they pull apart their own huts to build the plane, racing against Mr. Tweedy who is rapidly fixing the machine. Rocky is once again on the open road, but stops when he sees a promotional advertisement for "Mrs. Tweedy's Homemade Chicken Pies". He thinks about the chickens, and realizes the error of his ways.

In the end, the chickens finish the plane just as Mr. Tweedy finishes fixing the machine. They attack and tie him under one of the houses and finish construction. Fowler, as pilot, starts up the plane as all the chickens pedal to start the string engines. Mrs. Tweedy attacks Ginger and Rocky returns at the last moment to help out. The plane takes off and all the chickens cheer. Mrs. Tweedy manages to grab on, and slowly begins climbing up the rope of Christmas lights, holding an axe in her mouth. Ginger tries to cut the rope, while Rocky, Nick and Fetcher throw eggs at Mrs. Tweedy, but end up nocking Ginger's scissors. Mrs. Tweedy, covered in egg, lifts her axe and the others think she cut off Ginger's head. What actually happened was she ducked and the rope got cut. Then Ginger, who's still holding onto both halves of the rope, lets go of the other half and Mrs. Tweedy falls right into the pie machine, which explodes, covering Mrs. Tweedy in gooey gravy destroying the barn. As Mr. Tweedy looks upon the wreckage, he reminds her "I told you they was organized." As Mrs. Tweedy growls at Mr. Tweedy, ready to blame him once again, the Barnhouse door falls down on her.

At long last, the chickens have reached peace in their own small haven. Mac gives some baby chickens some lessons while Fowler tells them some stories. Ginger has apparently mated with Rocky and the rats are still trying to make an egg business.


Trivia.

Edwina, the chicken who is killed by the Tweedies at the beginning of the film, is a reference to politician Edwina Currie. Currie was a Junior Health Minister under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when, in 1988, she issued a warning about salmonella in eggs. This caused a collapse in the British egg market and Currie was forced to resign (or "get the chop" as commentators sometimes refer to ministers who have resigned or been sacked from office).

The large dogs employed by Mrs. Tweedy to keep the chickens in check may be partially based on those belonging to Miranda Richardson, the actress who played her.

Chicken Run was the first feature film in Europe to use the Digital Intermediate process, Digitally storing and manipulating every frame of the film before recording back to film.

 The sequence in which Rocky and Ginger are trapped inside Mrs. Tweedy's pie-making machine and encounter various mechanical dangers is a parody of the three Indiana Jones films' various cliffhanger dangers and subsequent escapes.

 There was a heavy push by voters to get Chicken Run nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, à la Beauty and the Beast (1991). Its failure to earn the nomination led the next year to the creation of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, which Shrek (also made by DreamWorks) won.

 The promo title featured on posters for the film, "C:R-1", was spoof of the promo title "M:I-2" for the film .

 In early versions of the movie, Ginger had a little brother named Nobby, but the idea was dropped in order to make the film less cute.

 The reason all the chickens are wearing scarves is to hide the join between the head and the body. The scarves hide the 'seam' which is present because the bodies of the chickens are articulated steel frames coated in silicon rubber while the heads are plasticine.

 The propeller of the escape plane is made of road signs sharing names with famous RAF bombers of WWII - Stirling Lane, Lancaster Avenue and Blenheim Place. Further, the model aeroplane is of a moderately successful RAF bomber of the early war period, the Whitley.

Nickelodeon Magazine is a children's magazine published by the Nickelodeon cable TV channel. It was first published in 1990 at a cover price of $1.95 and was distributed for free at participating Pizza Hut restaurants, but production ceased after the second issue . The magazine returned to production in Summer 1993. Originally published on a quarterly basis, it switched to bi-monthly with its February/March 1994 issue. It then went to 10 times per year starting March 1995. It is still published monthly except for the June/July and December/January issues.

As of November 2006, Nickelodeon Magazine has had 126 issues.

In spite of being related to the network it is named after, Nickelodeon Magazine covers all sorts of topics for kids, whether inside the network or outside. It contains informative non-fiction pieces, humor, interviews, comics, pranks, and recipes (such as green slime cake).

The magazine's mascot is Zelda Van Gutters, a Lakeland Terrier dog who appears throughout the magazine making smart alecky comments. On the table of contents, Zelda introduces herself as the magazine's "roving reporter". She is also the star of the magazine's regular photo comic strip "Ruffing It".

In May 2006, the magazine got a makeover with a brand new logo but the insides such as the comic book stayed the same.

The Comic Book.
Every issue of Nickelodeon magazine includes a section called "The Comic Book". Usually, this insert is made up of regular comic strips from underground artists. The original editor of the section was Anne D. Bernstein. Since 1997 it has been edited by Chris Duffy, who was joined by Dave Roman a few years later. Among the comics featured in Nickelodeon magazine's comic book:

 Scene But Not Heard by Sam Henderson- The going-ons of a pink man and a bear, who compulsively pull pranks on each other. As the strip's name suggests, the comic is made entirely of pictures, but has no dialogue or sound.
 Southern Fried Fugitives by Simon and Kim Deitch- The continuing adventures of a quartet of fried chicken pieces brought to life by a thunderstorm. This strip ended in December 1999.
 Sam Hill & Ray-9 by Mark Martin - A boy and his robot dog.
 Underpants-On-His-Head Man by Michael Kupperman- Originally appeared as one of "the worst comic book superheroes ever". As his name suggests, he wears his underwear on his head. His archenemy is his coworker, Pants-On-His-Head Man.
 Patty-Cake by Scott Roberts- A bossy little blonde with a flower in her hair.
 Fiona of the Felines by Terry LaBan- A girl who is raised by cats. Her strips are occasionally accompanied by a similar strip titled Warren of the Worms.
 Impy & Wormer by James Kochalka - These mini-strips (featured at the bottom of the pages, under the regular strips) feature a stupid bug who constantly bothers a comparatively intellectual worm.
 Cody by Bobby London- Drawn somewhat like The Katzenjammer Kids, this strip's title character is often misled by the fibs told by his grandfather, Poppy. It always ends with Cody's four cat's saying something.
 Grampa and Julie, Shark Hunters by Jef Czekaj- This strip's titular pair of a girl and her dim-witted grandfather started out searching for Stephen, the Largest Shark in the World. Their adventures from 1999 to 2003 have recently been reprinted in a graphic novel. An animated version of the comic is now in the pilot stages at Klasky Csupo. ;
 Teeny Weeny, the Tiniest Hot Dog in the World by Mark Martin - A miniature hot dog with lots of enthusiasm.
 Karmopolis by Nick Bertozzi--Adventure strip in a world where everyone and everything is on wheels.
 The Gag Station by various. One panel gags, often featuring cartoonists such as Johnny Ryan, Mark Newgarden, Ellen Forney, Steve Weissman, Feggo, Ian Baker, and Mark Martin.

In addition, Nickelodeon magazine's Comic Book also features comic strips based on of the cartoons exclusive to the network. These strips usually show up if something big is happening with the shows themselves, usually when a special episode or a movie (theatrical or made-for-TV) premieres. Nicktoon comics appear once an issue. Among the Nicktoons that have been featured in the Comic Book:

 Aaahh!!! Real Monsters;

<doc id="2153281" title="Dark star" nonfiltered="739" processed="731" dbindex="450745">
This article is about astronomical objects. For other topics, please see the Dark Star disambiguation page.;

A dark star is a theoretical object that obeys the laws of Newtonian mechanics, and has a surface escape velocity that equals or exceeds the speed of light. 
Light emitted at the surface of a dark star might in Newtonian mechanics be in such a circumstances be trapped by the star s gravity, hence the name.  

Einstein s  gravitational  general theory of relativity incorporated some modifications to Newtonian relationships introduced by the special theory of relativity, and as a result the physics of these objects is different: according to general relativity, and later according to quantum mechanics, these objects show more extreme behaviour, and are not just  dark  stars, but black holes.

Dark star history.
John Michell and dark stars.
In 1783 John Michell wrote a long letter to Henry Cavendish outlining the expected properties of dark stars, published by The Royal Society in their 1784 volume. Michell calculated that when a surface whose escape velocity was equal or greater than lightspeed generated light, that light would be gravitationally trapped, so that the star would not be visible to a distant astronomer. 

Michell s idea for calculating the number of such  invisible  stars anticipated 20th century astronomers' work: he suggested that since a certain proportion of double-star systems might be expected to contain at least one  dark  star, we could search for and catalogue as many double-star systems as possible, and identify cases where only a single circling star was visible. This would then provide some sort of statistical baseline for calculating the amount of other unseen stellar matter that might exist in addition to the visible stars.

Dark stars and gravitational shifts.
Michell also suggested that future astronomers might be able to identify the surface gravity of a distant star by seeing how far the star s light was shifted to the weaker end of the spectrum, a precursor of Einstein s 1911 gravity-shift argument. However, Michell cited Newton as saying that blue light was less energetic than red (Newton thought that more massive particles were associated with bigger wavelengths), so Michell s predicted spectral shifts were in the wrong direction. It is difficult to tell whether Michell s careful citing of Newton s position on this may have reflected a lack of conviction on Michell s part over whether Newton was correct, or whether it was just academic thoroughness. 

Laplace and dark stars.
A few years later, Pierre-Simon Laplace also considered the idea of gravitationally-cloaked stars in his book,  System du Monde , apparently independently of Michell. Later as the wave theory of light became popular he dropped the idea.

Indirect radiation.
Dark stars and black holes both have a surface escape velocity equal or greater than lightspeed, and a critical radius of r   2M. 

However, the dark star is capable of emitting indirect radiation - outward-aimed light and matter can leave the r = 2M surface briefly before being recaptured, and whilst outside the critical surface, can interact with other matter, or be accelerated free from the star by a chance encounter with other matter. A dark star therefore has a rarefied atmosphere of  visiting particles , and this ghostly halo of matter and light can radiate, albeit weakly.

Comparisons.
Differences between a dark star and a black hole.
A dark star may emit indirect radiation as described above.  Black holes as described by current theories about quantum mechanics emit radiation through a different process, Hawking radiation, first postulated in 1975.  The radiation emitted by a dark star depends on its composition and structure; Hawking radiation, by the no-hair theorem is generally thought of as depending only on the black hole's mass, charge, and angular momentum, although this black hole information paradox is controversial.

Light is bent differently by a dark star and a black hole.  Because light is massless under Newtonian mechanics, it could be (and was) argued that Newtonian gravity does not bend light at all.  If Newtonian objects (including dark stars) do bend light gravitationally, they would bend light by an amount of 2M/r.  This is half as much as the bending according to relativistic physics, which is 4M/r.  Since observations all confirm the relativistic version, a dark star could not exist.

"Shy Boy" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It appears on their 1983 debut album Deep Sea Skiving and was released as its second single.  It was written and produced by the production team of Steve Jolley and Tony Swain and marked the first in a long line of studio collaborations between them and Bananarama.

Released in summer 1982, "Shy Boy" became the third consecutive single by Bananarama to hit the top-five, reaching number four in the UK singles chart.  It also was a success in Australia, where it reached number two, becoming their first top 40 hit in that country.  Top-ten success also followed in New Zealand and Canada.  "Shy Boy" charted well on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart and was the first of Bananarama's singles to dent the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eighty-three.

The music video featured the girls giving a nerdy guy a make-over into a stud. When his new look attracts the attention of a sexy secretary, the girls get their revenge by dousing him with a bucket of water. It stars Terry Sharpe of The Adventures, who was Sara Dallin's boyfriend at the time.

Opera Australia which is based in Sydney, is Australia's major opera company. It is the third busiest opera company in the world, after the Metropolitan (New York) and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, (London) .

Its performance season at the Sydney Opera House runs for approximately eight months of the year, with the remainder of its time spent in the The Arts Centre in Melbourne, Victoria. In 2004, the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in Sydney and Melbourne, attended by more than 294,000 people. 

Like most opera companies, it is funded by a combination of government money, corporate sponsorship, private philanthropy, and ticket sales.  The proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies, approximately 75%.

As well as the traditional classical repertoire, a number of Australian operas have been premiered by the company, including the recent Lindy, by Moya Henderson, which is based on the Lindy Chamberlain case. Opera Australia will be giving the first performances outside America of Andre Previn's opera A Streetcar Named Desire in its 2007 Sydney season.

The company is perhaps best known internationally for its association with Dame Joan Sutherland, one of the most famous sopranos of the 1980s, and Baz Luhrmann's attention-grabbing production of Puccini's La bohème in the early 1990s.

By the end of 2004, Opera Australia provided employment to approximately 1,300 Australians.  
OzOpera (Opera Australia's education, access and development arm) presented the La bohème production in Victoria, Northern Territory and Western Australia, attended by 13,350 people, while OzOpera's Schools Company performed to over 63,500 primary age children in more than 360 performances in urban and regional New South Wales and Victoria. Many thousands of Australians also experienced the work of their national opera company through television, radio, video, compact disc, DVD, and the annual free performance of opera in the Domain in Sydney. 

Australian Opera Company 1956-57.
In 1956, the Australian Opera Company was formed in Sydney under the auspices of the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. It commemorated the Mozart bicentenary by presenting four Mozart operas in all capital cities, travelling more than 10,000 kilometres, and giving 169 performances. A truly national company was in place.

Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company, 1957-70.
By 1957, it changed its name to the Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera Company.

In the years before 1970, the company gave its first regional tour with Rossini's The Barber of Seville using a small chorus and reduced scenery with only a piano accompaniment. However, by 1963 a permanent nucleus of singers and staff was retained throughout the year and the company had made appearances at regional festivals, including Adelaide. It also was able to establish the first Elizabethan Trust Orchestra for the company by 1967 with additional government aid.

While not yet appearing with this company, Joan Sutherland, then an internationally known Australian soprano, and her husband, Richard Bonynge, the conductor, by the mid-1960s helped the cause of opera in general in Australia.  

Another milestone was a television recording of Puccini s Tosca for broadcasting.  This starred internationally-known baritone, Tito Gobbi in addition to two Australian singers, the soprano Marie Collier and tenor Donald Smith.

The Australian Opera, 1970-96.
In 1970, the company became known as The Australian Opera. The 1970s saw considerable changes both in administration and location. In 1972, Edward Downes, formerly associated with London s Royal Opera House, became Musical Director, and his first new production was the Australian premiere of Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, followed closely by Prokofiev's War and Peace as the opening night performance of the brand new Sydney Opera House.

The Sydney Opera House, as well as quickly becoming a distinctive cultural landmark in that city, gave the company a permanent performance home and thus helped to expand its repertoire and develop local audiences. Audiences were certainly boosted by Joan Sutherland s performances with The Australian Opera in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann. In addition, in the 1974 season three Australian works were performed : The Affair by Felix Werder, Lenz by Larry Sitsky, and Rites of Passage by Peter Sculthorpe.

By 1976 Richard Bonynge had become Musical Director and he led the company on its first overseas tour to New Zealand with Verdi's Rigoletto and Janá ek's Jenufa. This was followed in 1978 by the first Australian Opera country tour with orchestra to north-western New South Wales and Queensland. 

During the 1980s, after many years of recording performances by the Australian Opera for television, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and The Australian Opera presented their first live simulcast, Johann Strauss' Die Fledermaus, and it was seen by more than two million people. Over the following years a series of simulcasts reached millions of Australian homes.

On the popular front, a big box office success was the appearance of Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland at the Concert Hall of the Sydney Opera House, with the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge. This nationally simulcast performance broke box office records for an indoor event

In addition, several innovative features characterized this period of the 1980s. The first  Esso Opera in the Park  in the Sydney Domain quickly became an annual event, and it is now called  Opera in the Domain . Typically, it attracts almost 100,000 people each year. A similar annual outdoor event, which attracts more than 25,000 people, is held in Melbourne.  The second was the establishment of  The Esso Young Artists' Development Program  for the Australian Opera under the direction of soprano Cynthia Johnston, while the third was the  Australian Compositions Program  launched with a new production of Brian Howard's Metamorphosis. 
 
Also, at this time, the fourth of these innovative programs began with  The National Opera Workshop , established to enable selected Australian composers present works in workshop form with artists from the Australian Opera. Lastly,  OperaAction , the  Youth Education Program  established a program of events, including three Youth performances of Puccini's Madama Butterfly and, in 1986, Winds of the Solstice, an original youth opera created by 70 students working on libretto, music, choreography and orchestration and presented at the Sydney Opera House.

In 1988, in association with the Australian Bicentennial Authority, the company toured Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and the National Opera Workshop in Melbourne with The Ra Project, a music-theatre work composed with the direct participation from the earliest stages of the singers who performed it and marking director Baz Luhrmann's first association with the Australian Opera.

When she retired from the operatic stage, Dame Joan Sutherland gave her farewell performances for the Australian Opera in 1990 in a production of Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.  Two years later, the company named its major rehearsal studio after Dame Joan.

The early 1990s were to see two important changes in the way that the company worked: firstly, in 1991, with the formation of the  Artistic Associates of The Australian Opera , a body of people was created which comprised some of the most important figures in the Australian musical and performing arts world. Secondly, the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra was integrated with the Australian Opera to produce a permanent opera and ballet orchestra for the company.

In its first performances outside Australasia in 1994, the company performed Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Edinburgh International Festival. In addition, the Baz Luhrmann production of La bohème was screened over more than 300 North American television stations, followed by worldwide video release.

Opera Australia, 1996 to present.
Opera Australia was formed by the merger of the Australian Opera and the Victorian State Opera (VSO) companies in 1996, following a major review, commissioned by the Australian Government, of the government-supported performing arts companies in Australia.  At this time Lindy Hume, then Artistic Director of the VSO, was appointed Artistic Director of OzOpera. Richard Gill succeeded her in 2003.

It undertook a "pilot" regional tour of Mozart's The Magic Flute to four states. Following performances at the Adelaide Festival, OzOpera performed The Magic Flute in The Barracks at Queenscliff, the Great Hall of Parliament House in Canberra, and in a cinema in Mudgee.

The first few years of the present century saw the retirement of Moffatt Oxenbould, Opera Australia's Artistic Director for 15 years, and the appointment of Simone Young as Musical Director-designate. She assumed the position fully from 2001. To honour the retiring director, the Young Artists' Program was renamed the  Moffatt Oxenbould Young Artists' Development Program .  By 2003 Richard Hickox was appointed Music Director-designate, which became fully effective from January 2005.

Late 2005 saw changes yet again with the creation of a new Victorian Opera in Melbourne in November. Under the direction of Richard Gill, this revived company may result in a reduction of  visits of Opera Australia to Melbourne when the company begins its productions.
 
However, the creation of this new company is not without controversy as the Melbourne daily newspaper, The Age, noted on 20 December 2005:   Clumsy was the word for the tortured machinations of the Victorian Government's plans to develop a new state opera company, Victorian Opera, but finally (in November 2005) it was announced that Richard Gill would be its artistic director. The small but very vocal number of those in Melbourne's highly charged opera scene will be watching the company closely .

In an article on 21 December, John Slavin went on to say  The most intriguing opera in town this year was the one that didn't reach the stage. It was the battle to establish a state company. Now that the final curtain has fallen and the new company, Victorian Opera, has been established....the key question is whether lovers of opera in Victoria will be better off.... The symptom that has caused grief and outrage has been the phantom participation of Opera Australia in the artistic life of Melbourne.  In 2004, OA brought seven productions to the State Theatre - down from eight in 2003 - including a Gilbert and Sullivan, which is a patent appeal to a wider audience, to raise box-office takings.  This year, we have again seen seven productions....  (and) the new musical director of Opera Australia, Richard Hickox, has announced the 2006 Melbourne season in which that slender presence will be maintained at seven productions, of which one will be Gilbert and Sullivan. 

Educational Outreach.
In 1977 Opera Australia's younger parent company, Victoria State Opera (VSO), which itself was established as a successor to the Victorian Opera Company created the Schools Company which remains a cornerstone of Opera Australia activity. Now performing in New South Wales and Victoria, the Schools Company is administered by OzOpera which tours smaller centres and performs in non-traditional settings (for instance, for school groups).  Its music director is Richard Gill, and it is administered from Opera Australia's Melbourne office.  Esso and its successor Exxon-Mobil have sponsored the Schools Company regularly since 1984 under the direction of soprano Cynthia Johnson.  With the establishment of an Education program, Opera Access, in 1978 secondary students were able to attend opera.

Willson Osborne (1906   1979) was an American composer. 

After completing the undergraduate program in composition and music theory at the University of Michigan (studying with Ross Lee Finney), Osborne was a student of Paul Hindemith at Yale University. Osborne was, like his mentor, a neoclassical composer. He taught music theory and composition at Philadelphia's New School of Music (now part of the Boyer College of Music at Temple University). Osborne's work remains little-known except for his Rhapsody, which is the most frequently-performed work in the literature for unaccompanied bassoon, and in an adapted version is also popular as a recital piece for the clarinet. The Rhapsody, originally written in 1952 as "Study for Bassoon", came into the public notice after being recorded by noted Philadelphia Orchestra bassonist Sol Schoenbach and broadcast on WNYC during a special contemporary American music feature. Despite the success of this piece, little has been written about Osborne or his work. 

In addition to the Rhapsody, Osborne wrote several solo piano pieces (including a set entitled Six Pieces for the Young Pianist), chamber pieces for brass ensembles, and works for a cappella mixed choir, and also arranged and harmonized several other works. His last published original composition was a 1965 piano solo, "The Quiet Sons"; though he continued to write, the later works remain unpublished.

The S5G reactor is a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships.  The S5G designation stands for:

 S = Submarine platform;
 5 = Fifth generation core designed by the contractor;
 G = General Electric was the contracted designer;

This nuclear reactor was installed both as a land-based prototype at the Nuclear Power Training Unit, Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, and on board the  USS Narwhal (SSN-671).  It was intended to test the potential contribution of natural circulation technology to submarine quieting.

Reactor primary coolant pumps are one of the primary sources of noise from submarines, and the elimination of coolant pumps and associated equipment would also reduce mechanical complexity and the space required by propulsion equipment. Its design was the direct ancestor of the S8G reactor used on the Ohio class submarines.

To further reduce engine plant noise, the normal propulsion setup of two steam turbines driving the screw through a reduction gear unit was changed instead to one large propulsion turbine with no reduction gears.  This eliminated the noise from the main reduction gears, but the cost was to have a huge main propulsion turbine.  The turbine was cylindrical, about 12 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet long.  This massive size was necessary to allow it to turn slowly enough to directly drive the screw and be fairly efficient in doing so.  The propulsion setup was used on both the USS Narwhal and the land-based prototype.

<doc id="2377391" title="Fuse (hydraulic)" nonfiltered="748" processed="740" dbindex="450754">
In hydraulic systems, a fuse is a component which prevents the sudden loss of hydraulic fluid pressure. It is a safety feature, designed to allow systems to continue operating, or at least to not fail catastrophically, in the event of a system breach.

The term "fuse" is used here in analogy with electrical fuses which perform a similar function.

Hydraulic systems rely on high pressures (usually over 7000 kPa) to work properly. If a hydraulic system loses fluid pressure, it will become inoperative and components such as actuators may collapse. Obviously this is an undesirable condition in life-critical systems such as aircraft or heavy machinery. Hydraulic fuses help guard against catastrophic failure of a hydraulic system (for instance, by line breakage or component failure) by automatically isolating the defective branch.

When a hydraulic system is damaged, there is generally a rapid flow of hydraulic fluid towards the breach. Most hydraulic fuses detect this flow and seal themselves if the flow exceeds a predetermined limit. There are many different fuse designs but most involve a passive spring-controlled mechanism which closes when the pressure differential across the fuse becomes excessive.

There are two types of hydraulic fuses. The first one acts like a pressure relief valve, venting in case of a pressure surge. The second is more or less like a check valve. The only difference is a check valve is in place to prevent upstream fluid from coming back and venting out. A fuse is in place before the venting area and stops fluid from venting forward of it.

Hydraulic fuses are not a perfect solution to fluid loss. They will probably be ineffective against slow, seeping loss of hydraulic fluid, and they may be unable to prevent fluid loss in the event of a catastrophic system failure involving multiple breaches to hydraulic lines. Also, when a fuse activates it is likely that the system will no longer function as designed.

Depending on the system, hydraulic fuses may reset automatically after a delay, or may require manual re-opening.

-------
In the design of a spillway for a dam, a fuse plug is a water retaining structure designed to wash out in a controlled fashion if the main dam is in danger of overtopping due to flood, and if the normal spillway channel is insufficient to control the over topping.

Westminster Chapel is an evangelical church that has been based in central London since 1840. Situated in Buckingham Gate, just 200 yards from Buckingham Palace and just off Victoria Street, the chapel has long been a popular meeting place for evangelical Christians. It was founded by Congregationalists, and was pastored by Dr Martyn Lloyd-Jones from 1939 to 1968.  During the Lloyd-Jones pastorate, it resigned from the Congregational Union and  became instead a member of the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches. 

Subsequently, the church was pastored by Bible teacher RT Kendall (1977   2002), and currently (2006) Greg Haslam is minister of the church, having previously been the pastor of a newfrontiers church in Winchester.

Origins.
The chapel's own website summarises the origins:"In 1840 the area where Westminster Chapel now stands was relatively undeveloped. Since that time the area has improved considerably and historic attractions such as Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey bring millions of tourists to the area each year." Prior to the arrival of Greg Haslam in 2002, Westminster Chapel had four particularly well-known pastors: the Rev'd Samuel Martin (1842 1878), Dr G Campbell Morgan (1904 1917 and 1933 1943), Dr D Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1939 1968) and Dr RT Kendall (1977 2002).

Bailando por un sueño is a segment inside the television program of Argentina called "Showmatch", emitted by Channel 13. Taking the format of the program as a base of ¡Mira quién baila! of Spain or Dancing with the Stars of Australia, Bailando por un sueño it looks like more the Mexican version of the same one.

On the contest, an anonymous dreamer (man or woman) that besides must be an amateur dancer, is accompanied by an Argentine celebrity in a contest of dance, where, week to week, they will have to demonstrate their skills for the dance in different paces, since: tango, chacarera, salsa, merengue, flamenco, rock, disco, hip-hop, axé, etc. The couple who obtains fewer points on the part of the juror will remain sentenced in order that this way, is the public who with their SMS's, or telephone calls, votes for what couple must be the one that will continue in the program.

Today, there is in the air the third edition of this famous contest, being sworn of same icons of the artistic Argentine scene like: Reina Reech, Moria Casán, Gerardo Sofovich and Jorge Lafauci.

By the way, inside the program Showmatch that Marcelo Tinelli leads, there is another contest of similar characteristics called Singing for a dream or Cantando por un sueño. Practically every night in that both segments are emitted, both manage to be leaders of hearing in their finge time, in spite of the fact that part of the viewers considers that the program should turn out to be heavy.

Unlike the international versions, Dancing for a dream (Argentina), it took, from the second edition, the most polemic course due to the constant discords and discussions of the famous ones who accompany the dreamer and the members of the juror. This, more than anything,  do that Showmatch rises of rating the nights in which the juror counts to the couples.

Ginette Reynal (TV host) (partnered by Pablo Pezet) - 5th evicted;
Amalia "Yuyito" González (actress/journalist) (partnered by Carlos Juárez) - 4th evicted;
Karina Jelinek (model) (partnered by César Soria) - 3rd evicted;
Beatriz Salomón (actress) (partnered by Franco Contreras) - 2nd evicted;
Alejandra Pradón (dancer) (partnered by Nicolás Avoletta) - 1st evicted;
Miss Pradón had quit the contest on 6 October 2006 on account of health concerns, but agreed to return when she partnered Mr. Avoletta on the elimination round three days later. In the end, after an argument with the panel of judges over her stance in the competition, she left the program before it was revealed that she and Mr. Avoletta had been eliminated by the viewers' vote.;

In this third season, the panel of judges was presided until 23 November 2006 by impresario and TV producer/host Gerardo Sofovich, alongside journalist Jorge Lafauci, actress and dancer Moria Casán, and actress and dancer Reina Reech. On Tuesday, 21 November, Mr. Sofovich announced that he would be resigning his post as the panel of judges  president on account of what he felt were  some participants  insolence and lack of respect for the judges , and his vexation at the quarrels that had involved him (first with celebrity Laura Fidalgo, with whom he had already had an altercation before the contest, then with Javier Rojas, and lastly with the recently evicted Eduardo Garro). Although the show's host and producer (and Mr. Sofovich's personal friend) Marcelo Tinelli entreated with him to stay, his production stated that his replacements will rotate weekly for the remainder of the show. For the week of November 27, former football star Diego Maradona (who had competed in the Italian Ballando con le Stelle in 2005) will be taking over Gerardo Sofovich's seat in the panel of judges.

Old Rauma (Vanha Rauma in Finnish) is the wooden city centre of the town of Rauma, Finland. It is listed as a Unesco world heritage site.

The area of Old Rauma is about 0.3 km², with approximately six hundred buildings (counting both proper houses and smaller buildings like sheds) and about 800 people living in the area. The town of Rauma expanded outside the Old Rauma proper only in the early 1800s. The oldest buildings date from the 18th century, as two fires of 1640 and 1682 destroyed the town. Most buildings are currently inhabited and owned by private individuals, although along the two main streets and around the town square they are mainly in business use.

Locations of special interest include the Kirsti  house, which is a seaman's house from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the Marela house, which is a shipowner's house dating to the 18th century but with a 19th century facade, both of which are currently museums. Other sights include the rare stone buildings of the Old Rauma: the Church of the Holy Cross, an old Franciscan monastery church from the 15th century with medieval paintings and the old town hall from 1776. Another church in Rauma, the Church of the Holy Trinity, also from the 15th century, burned in the fire of 1640.

Doctor Wortle's School, alternatively Dr. Wortle's School or Dr Wortle's School, published in 1881, is a fictional novel by Anthony Trollope, his fortieth book. 
Note: While it may seem that , outcomes of the events listed here are not disclosed and Trollope himself reveals much of the plot in the beginning.

The novel takes place in the respectable, fictional parish of Bowick, Victorian England, with the main plot concerning itself with the renown Dr. Wortle's Christian seminary academy. The community's morals are outraged and the school's credibility wounded upon the discovery that Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke, a respectable American couple hired to the academy by Wortle, are indeed improperly married. Their wedlock was rendered asunder by their chance meeting, some years prior, of Mrs. Peacocke's first husband, an abusive drunkard named Colonel Ferdinand Lefroy. Hearing that an ambiguous Colonel Lefroy was killed during the Civil War, the two rightfully assumed it was Ferdinand  and married. Yet it is their strange persistence in living as husband and wife, even after the shocking revelation, that creates a scandal. Wortle, though religious, sympathizes with the Peacockes and is understanding of their love for each other and hatred for Colonel Lefroy.
The book is thus of the interest in providing multiple stories: that of Wortle's attempt to rebuild his reputation, provide rebuttal for malicious slander and all the while insist he was right in hiring the Peacockes; Mr. Peacocke's journey to America in search of Ferdinand's true status; the sexual concerns of the Wortles' daughter Mary and the insights of the community members who see the intentional bigamy as a sin.

<doc id="729317" title="Transmission (medicine)" nonfiltered="760" processed="752" dbindex="450766">
In medicine, transmission is the passing of a disease from an infected individual or group to a previously uninfected individual or group.
The microorganisms (bacteria and viruses) that cause disease may be transmitted from one person to another by one or more of the following means:
 droplet contact - coughing or sneezing on another person;
 direct physical contact - touching an infected person, including sexual contact;
 indirect contact - usually by touching soil contamination or a contaminated surface;
 airborne transmission - if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods;
 fecal-oral transmission - usually from contaminated food or water sources;
 vector borne transmission - carried by insects or other animals;

Microorganisms vary widely in the length of time that they can survive outside the human body, and so vary in how they are transmitted.


Transmission, symptoms and survival.

In order to survive, microorganisms that require human hosts must have a way to be transmitted from one host to another. Infectious agents are generally specialised for a particular method of transmission. Taking an example from the respiratory route, from an evolutionary perspective a virus or bacteria that causes its host to develop coughing and sneezing symptoms has a great survival advantage - it is much more likely to be ejected from one host and carried to another.  This is also the reason that many microorganisms cause diarrhea.


Routes of transmission.

Droplet contact.

Also known as the respiratory route, it is a typical mode of transmission among many infectious agents. If an infected person coughs or sneezes on another person the microorganisms, suspended in warm, moist droplets, may enter the body through the nose, mouth or eye surfaces. Diseases that are commonly spread by coughing or sneezing include (at least):
 Bacterial Meningitis;
 Chickenpox;
 Common cold;
 Influenza;
 Mumps;
 Strep throat;
 Tuberculosis;
 Measles;
 Rubella;
 Whooping cough;

Fecal-oral transmission.

Direct contact is rare in this route, for humans at least. More common are the indirect routes; foodstuffs or water become contaminated (by people not washing their hands before preparing food, or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply) and the people who eat and drink them become infected. In developing countries most sewage is discharged into the environment or on cropland as of 2006; even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow.  This is the typical mode of transmission for the infectious agents of (at least):
Cholera;
Hepatitis A;
Polio;
Rotavirus;
Salmonellosis;

Sexual transmission.

This refers to any disease that can be caught during sexual activity with another person, including vaginal or anal sex or (less commonly) through oral sex (see below). Transmission is either directly between surfaces in contact during intercourse (the usual route for bacterial infections and those infections causing sores) or from secretions (semen or the fluid secreted by the excited female) which carry infectious agents that get into the partner's blood stream through tiny tears in the penis, vagina or rectum (this is a more usual route for viruses). In this second case, anal sex is considerably more hazardous since penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina, as the vagina is stretchier and more accommodating.

Some diseases transmissible by the sexual route include (at least):
AIDS;
Chlamydia;
Genital warts;
Gonorrhea;
Hepatitis B;
Syphilis;

Oral sexual transmission.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B are thought to not normally be transmitted through mouth-to-mouth contact, although it is possible to transmit some STDs between the genitals and the mouth, during oral sex.  In the case of HIV this possibility has been established. It is also responsible for the increased incidence of herpes simplex virus 1 (which is usually responsible for oral infections) in genital infections and the increased incidence of the type 2 virus (more common genitally) in oral infections.

Oral transmission.

Diseases that are transmitted primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing, or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette.

Diseases that are known to be transmissible by kissing or by other direct or indirect oral contact include all of the diseases listed above as transmissible by droplet contact and also (at least):

 Cytomegalovirus infections ;
 Herpes simplex virus (especially HSV-1);
 Mononucleosis;

(Notice these are all forms of herpes virus.)

Transmission by direct contact.

Diseases that can be transmitted by direct contact are called contagious (contagious is not the same as infectious; although all contagious diseases are infectious, not all infectious diseases are contagious). These diseases can also be transmitted by sharing a towel (where the towel is rubbed vigorously on both bodies) or items of clothing in close contact with the body (socks, for example) if they are not washed thoroughly between uses. For this reason, contagious diseases often break out in schools, where towels are shared and personal items of clothing accidentally swapped in the changing rooms.

Some diseases that are transmissible by direct contact include:
Athlete's foot;
Impetigo;
Syphilis (on rare occasions, if an uninfected person touches a chancre);
Warts;

Vertical transmission.
This is from mother to child, often in utero, as a result of the incidental exchange of bodily fluids (mostly blood) during childbirth or (rarely) through breast milk.

Some diseases that can be transmitted in this way include:
AIDS;
Hepatitis B;
Syphilis;

Iatrogenic transmission.
Transmission due to medical procedures, such as injection or transplantation of infected material.

Some diseases that can be transmitted iatrogenically include:
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease by injection of contaminated human growth hormone.
MRSA infection is often acquired as a result of a stay in hospital;

The route of transmission is important to epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene due to the lack of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as cholera. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good plumbing system, we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route.

<doc id="6884" title="Clitoris" nonfiltered="762" processed="754" dbindex="450769">


The clitoris (Greek ) is a female sexual organ. In humans, the visible knob-like portion is located near the anterior junction of the labia minora, above the opening of the urethra and vagina. Unlike the homologous male organ (the penis), the clitoris does not contain the distal portion of the urethra and functions solely to induce sexual pleasure. The only known exception to this is in the Spotted Hyena, where the urogenital system is modified so that the female urinates, mates and gives birth via an enlarged, erectile clitoris, known as a pseudo-penis. 

Pronunciation .
The word is pronounced: KLIHT uh rihs ( in IPA notation )) or klih TOHR ihs ( )). The plural forms are clitorises in English and clitorides in Latin.  In slang, it is sometimes abbreviated as clit.  The OED suggests that the pronunciation KLY tor ihs () is also used in the UK, and gives the likely etymology as coming from the Greek , perhaps derived from the verb , to shut.

Development and formation.


 

The female clitoris corresponds to homologous parts of the male penis, i.e., embryologically it comes from the same tissue that forms the penis. The trigger for forming a penis instead of a clitoris is the action of testosterone in utero (see clitoromegaly).

The organ is formed out of corpus cavernosum, a rich collection of capillary tissue with a substantial presence of nerve tissue. It contains twice the number of nerve endings as the penis, and it is particularly well-suited for sexual stimulation. 

The visible portions of the clitoris extend from the front commissure-where the edges of the outer lips (labia majora) meet at the base of the pubic mound-to the fourchette, and include the glans, hood, and inner lips (labia minora). The labia majora are not considered a part of the clitoris. The clitoral glans is entirely or partially covered by the clitoral hood or prepuce, tissue that is homologous to the foreskin in males. In humans, the clitoral body then extends several centimeters upwards and to the back, before splitting into two arms, the clitoral crura. Shaped like an inverted "V", these crura extend around and to the interior of the labia majora. Including external and internal components, it is thought the clitoris is similar in size to the penis.

Most of the clitoris is hidden, and external stimulation of the entire clitoris can result in a more profound sexual response. There is considerable variation among women with regard to how much of the clitoris protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from complete, covered invisibility to full, protruding visibility. Additionally, the size of the external clitoral shaft varies greatly; it may be smaller than a pencil eraser, or larger than a grape. Recently, urologist Dr. Helen O'Connell discovered that erectile tissue lies beneath the external glans, splitting off into two 11 cm "legs", with more tissue branching down near the vaginal opening. One explanation advanced for the vaginal orgasm is that it results from stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration. Nevertheless, some women experience both clitoral and vaginal orgasms and distinguish between them in terms of both the physical and general sensations associated with each, and the structure of the G-spot, located inside the vagina, must also be taken into consideration.

During sexual arousal, the clitoris enlarges as its erectile tissue fills with blood. Shortly before orgasm, this erection often increases further, drawing the clitoris upwards, so that viewed from the outside it actually appears to shrink.

Recognition of existence.
Medical literature first recognised the existence of the clitoris in the 16th century. This is the subject of some dispute: Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo) was a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, and in 1559 he published a book called De re anatomica in which he described the "seat of woman's delight". Colombo concluded, "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus."

Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (who discovered the fallopian tube), who claimed that he was the first to discover the clitoris. Caspar Bartholin, a 17th century Danish anatomist, dismissed both claims, arguing that the clitoris had been widely known to medical science since the 2nd century. It was also known to the Romans, who named it landica. Noted researchers Masters and Johnson conducted extensive studies of the clitoris.

Body modification.


The external part of the clitoris may be partially or totally removed during female genital cutting, also known as a clitoridectomy or female genital mutilation (FGM) in voluntary or involuntary procedures. The topic is highly controversial with many countries condemning the traditions that give rise to involuntary procedures, and with some countries outlawing even voluntary procedures. Amnesty International estimates that over 2 million involuntary female circumcisions are being performed every year, mainly in African countries.

In various cultures, the clitoris is sometimes pierced directly. In U.S. body modification culture, it's actually extremely rare for the clitoral shaft itself to be pierced, as of the already few females who desire the piercing, only a small percentage are anatomically suited for it; furthermore, most piercing artists are understandably reluctant to attempt such a delicate procedure. Some styles, such as the Isabella, the Nefertiti, and the triangle, do pass through the clitoris but are placed deep at the base, where they provide unique stimulation; they still require the proper genital build, but are more common than shaft piercings. Additionally, what is (erroneously) referred to as a "clit piercing" is almost always the much more common (and much less complicated) clitoral hood piercing.  

Some cultures at various times in history have practiced stretching, which can enlarge the clitoris, or can make it more visible. Enlargement may be intentional or unintentional. Those taking hormones and/or other medications as part of female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires (and the difficulties of surgical phalloplasty) often result in the retention of the female genitalia, the enlarged clitoris analogous to a penis as part of the newly male body. On the other hand, use of anabolic steroids by female bodybuilders and other athletes can result in significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on the female body. Temporary engorgement results from suction pumping, practiced to enhance sexual pleasure or for aesthetic purposes.

Events.
January-March.
February 7 - Venezuela wins its first Caribbean World Series championship since 1989 by rallying for two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the Dominican Republic 5 4. Alex González singles in the tying run off Jorge Sosa and scores the game-winning run on Henry Blanco's pop-fly double. Series MVP Ramón Hernández also hits a home run for Venezuela's Caracas Lions, who finish 6-0 in the Series. ;

March 3 - In the first-ever World Baseball Classic game, Jae Weong Seo pitches two-hit ball and Chan Ho Park works three effective innings for a save to lead South Korea past Taiwan 2 0. The first game of the 16-nation tournament starts at 11:30 a.m. local time and is played before a sparse crowd of 5,193 at Tokyo Dome. In the second game, playing before a crowd of 15,869, Tsuyoshi Nishioka and Kosuke Fukudome hit back-to-back home runs in the fifth inning to lead Japan to an 18 2 rout of China.

March 10 - In the World Baseball Classic, Giants minor leaguer Shairon Martis pitches a no-hitter for the Netherlands in a 10-0 victory over Panama that ends after seven innings because of the mercy rule.

March 19 - After 19 seasons, two-time NL All-Star pitcher Al Leiter retires after his first 2006 spring training appearance for the Yankees.

March 20 - Japan defeats Cuba 10-6 in the championship game of the 2006 World Baseball Classic. After falling behind 6-1 early in the game, Cuba pulls back to within one run entering the ninth inning before Japan closes the door. The championship game of the first international baseball tournament open to players from Major League Baseball features teams that, combined, have only two players on a Major League roster.

March 28 - Marquis Grissom announces his retirement after a 17-year career. The MVP of the 1997 ALCS, a four-time Gold Glove winner and two-time All-Star, Grissom retires as one of seven players with 2,000 hits, 200 home runs and 400 stolen bases.

March 30 - Commissioner Bud Selig appoints Red Sox director and former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell to head a probe into the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs in the major leagues. The investigation is initially limited to events since September 2002, when such drugs were banned in the majors, but Mitchell has the authority to expand its scope.

April-June.
April 6:
In the Phillies' 4-2 loss to the Cardinals, Jimmy Rollins goes 0-4, ending his multi-season hitting streak at 38 games.
R.A. Dickey of the Rangers ties a post-1900 major league record by giving up six home runs in 3 1/3 innings in Texas' 10-6 loss to the Tigers. Dickey had converted to throwing knuckleballs the previous season, and after this game he was sent to the Rangers' AAA team to work on it. Chris Shelton led the charge with two home runs. Magglio Ordóñez also hit two home runs, but only one off Dickey.

April 9 - Cory Sullivan of the Rockies becomes only the eleventh player in major league history to triple twice in the same inning. It is the first time the feat had been accomplished in over fifty years. The two triples came against Padres pitchers Jake Peavy and Chan Ho Park.

April 10 - The Cardinals play their first official game at the New Busch Stadium, a 6-4 victory over the Brewers.

April 17 - Pedro Martínez of the Mets becomes the 103rd major league pitcher in the modern era (and the 131st overall, including the pre-1900 era) to win 200 games in his career with a 4-3 victory over the Braves at Shea Stadium.

April 22 - The Brewers hit a record-tying five home runs in the fourth inning, scoring seven runs, as they defeat the Reds 11-0. Bill Hall, Damian Miller, Brady Clark and J.J. Hardy all hit their home runs off of Brandon Claussen before the first out is recorded in the inning. Prince Fielder hits the fifth homer off of Chris Hammond with two out. Miller's and Clark's are two-run homers, while the rest are solo.

April 28:
In a 6-2 victory over the Brewers, Cubs pitcher Greg Maddux earns the victory with 6 strikeouts and 2 ER over 6.0 IP, earning the first 5-0 start of his career.
Two home run records are tied or broken: Kevin Mench of the Rangers becomes the first right-handed batter in major league history to hit home runs in seven consecutive games, and Albert Pujols of the Cardinals ties a record with his 13th home run in the month of April. Mench failed to homer in his next game, falling short of tying the all-time record of eight consecutive games with a homer. Pujols would go on to break the record with 14 homers in April.

May 3-4 - The Washington Nationals are bought by Theodore N. Lerner, who has agreed to pay Major League Baseball's price of $450 million for the franchise; the following day, they break ground on their new ballpark.

May 15 - The annual Hall of Fame Game between the Reds and the Pirates is cancelled due to rain with the Reds leading 3-0 in the third inning; it is the fifth rainout in the game's history, and the first since 1993.

May 20   Barry Bonds ties Babe Ruth for second place on the career list, and first place among left-handed hitters, with his 714th home run during the Giants' road game against the Athletics.

May 21 - The Minnesota Legislature, on the last full day of the 2006 session, approves a new ballpark for the Minnesota Twins, scheduled to open for the 2010 season. Under the bill, the Twins are prohibited from being folded by Major League Baseball or moved from the state of Minnesota for the 30-year duration of the initial lease.

<doc id="6921136" title="Grand Master of Ceremonies" nonfiltered="765" processed="757" dbindex="450773">
The Grand Master of Ceremonies of France or Grand maître des cérémonies de France was one of the Great Offciers of the Maison du Roi ("King's Household") during the Ancien Régime and Bourbon Restoration.  His function was to organize all public ceremonies of the crown.

The position was created by Henri III on January 1 1585, to relieve the Grand Master of France of part of his workload.  The Grand Master of Ceremonies took his oath of office at the hands of the Grand Master of France.  

The Grand Master of Ceremonies oversaw state ceremonies and not court etiquette or private functions.  He played a role in ceremonies cerebrating or commemorating births, baptisms, marriages, and funerals for members of the royal family, royal feasts, ambassadorial receptions, the coronation, royal entries into towns, lits de justice, meetings of the States General and important assemblies.

The duties of The Grand Master of Ceremonies were principally :
 overseeing logistics of ceremonies (materials, workers, plans, menus);
 carrying messages and convocations from the king to Parlement, the other sovereign courts or notable individuals;
 accompanying the king and the queen , or foreign sovereigns, on their travels, so as to manage the ceremonies during the trip;
 making official records of the ceremonies to serve as jurisprudence and to aid future ceremonies;
 counselling the members of the court of their role in the ceremonies, and overseeing that the ceremonies unfold properly.

In the exercise of his functions, he was assisted by a "master of ceremonies" and an aide.

The Grand Master of Ceremonies carried a baton covered in black velvet, with an ivory tip.

The position was eliminated in 1792, but was reinstated during the Bourbon Restoration.

Red Storm Rising is a 1986 techno-thriller novel by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond about a Third World War in Europe between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces, set around the mid-1980s, probably in 1986 or 1987. Though there are other novels dealing with a fictional World War III, this one is notable for the way in which numerous settings for the action from Atlantic convoy duty to shooting down reconnaissance satellites to tank battles in Germany all have an integral part to play on the outcome. This is one of two novels that has no association with Clancy s others, as it does not fall in the Ryanverse.

The novel eventually lent its name to a game development company called Red Storm Entertainment, which Clancy co-founded in 1997.

Plot summary.

Azerbaijani terrorists destroy a new oil-production facility at Nizhnevartovsk, USSR, severely crippling Soviet oil production and threatening to wreck the Soviet economy.  Facing a perceived need to make crippling concessions to the West to survive the crisis, the Politburo chooses a different path:  war. The Politburo decides to seize the Persian Gulf oil fields by force.  According to the Carter Doctrine, any attack on the Persian Gulf is an attack on a vital strategic interest of the United States, and will be treated as such, meaning a military response.  To prevent NATO s combined reaction, they first launch a KGB operation to split NATO by making it appear as if West Germany launched an unprovoked terrorist attack on the Soviet Union, followed by an invasion of Europe in response to that  attack.   With West Germany occupied, and NATO defeated, it is expected (well, hoped) that the United States will not feel the need to rescue the Arab oil states, as it can meet its oil needs with Western Hemisphere sources.

The KGB operation has limited success:  the coming Soviet attack on Germany is detected only a few days in advance when a Spetsnaz major is captured in Aachen. The officer s capture gives NATO time to start mobilization and providing sufficient evidence to prevent the complete fracturing of the alliance. Nonetheless, it scores some success, as several countries, notably Greece and Japan, are convinced that this is a  German-Russian disagreement  that they refuse to be involved in. Thus, the Soviets have a quiet Pacific theater, and remove the southern front in the coming conflict in Western Europe as Turkey is unable (or unwilling) to launch an offensive alone. NATO aircraft manage to reduce Soviet ground superiority early in the war by using first-generation stealth planes and tactical fighter-bombers to eliminate five Soviet Mainstay AWACS aircraft, several bridges, bridge equipment and crews, and Soviet tactical fighters, but this advantage is short lived. Germany becomes the epicenter of the conflict; here, NATO forces slowly give ground while inflicting terrible losses on the Red Army.

 
One of the strategic masterstrokes of the Soviet Union s opening moves in the war is its seizure of Iceland, capturing the NATO air station at Keflavík.  This disrupts the G-I-U.K.  SOSUS line (American seabed hydrophones), expected to prevent the Soviet Navy from operating effectively in the Atlantic by making it impossible for their ships and submarines to enter the Atlantic undetected. In addition, the Soviet Navy isolate and protect their SSBN fleet, freeing their SSN force. The Soviet Navy is able to act as an offensive weapon, and the Warsaw Pact seriously damages NATO s war effort by interdicting resupply convoys coming from North America with both aircraft and submarines. This advantage is put to immediate use, as a NATO carrier battle group, led by USS Nimitz, USS Saratoga and the French carrier Foch, is successfully attacked by Soviet Backfire bombers. Foch is sunk, the transport Saipan explodes, taking 2,500 Marines with her, and the two American carriers are forced to spend several weeks in drydock at Southampton, England.

In West Germany, the battle becomes a war of attrition that the Soviets expect to win, having greater reserves of men and matériel.  NATO holds the Warsaw Pact forces to small but continual advances, but only through the profligate expenditure of every weapon at hand, and as the Soviet success in destroying the Atlantic convoys continues things start to look grim for the NATO forces. With the death of the Soviet political favorite CinC-West by a NATO air attack on the Russian rear lines, the more competent CinC-Southwest and his second-in-command, General-Colonel Pavel Leonidovich Alekseyev take over on the German front. Alekseyev commands a successful Soviet attack on the town of Alfeld, finally giving the Red Army the breakthrough it needs. As the OMG (Operational Maneuver Group) forces start to deploy, NATO looks to lose hold on all of Germany east of the Weser.

When a brilliantly timed naval attack on Russian bomber bases with submarine-launched cruise missiles cripples the Soviet bomber force, the Soviets lose their most effective convoy-killing weapon. Simultaneously, the Red Army proves unable to capitalize on its breakthrough, which leads the Politburo to consider the use of tactical nuclear weapons at the front to regain the initiative. A captured Soviet pilot from the Iceland campaign also (under heavy  medication ) reveals to the NATO forces why the war was started:  OIL. The NATO forces immediatly reevaluate their bombing tactics over the front and start blowing up every fuel depot they can find (which had been widely spaced and smaller than usual); this cripples the Soviet tanks, keeping them from launching at least one major attack which would have caught the NATO forces shorthanded and allowed reinforcements to arrive prior to the battle.

Eventually, General Alekseyev recognizes this suicidal madness for what it is, and joins forces with the head of the KGB and the Petroleum Minister, Mikhail Eduardovich Sergetov, in staging a coup d état, replacing the Politburo with a Troika consisting of Sergetov, Agriculture Minister F. M. Krylov, and longtime Politburo member Pyotr Bromkovskiy. A cease-fire is sought by the Soviets and accepted by an exhausted NATO, and the aftermath of the war is left unwritten.

Major themes.
This techno-thriller is an examination of a conventional ground war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Clancy suggests that several conventional ideas about a ground conflict between modern armies are wrong. For example, he proposes that munitions expenditures would be far higher than projected; that combat helicopters like the AH-64 Apache and the Mi-24 Hind are not nearly as survivable as projected; that the mobility granted by modern armor means that the Soviet doctrine of a massed thrust achieving a breakthrough of the enemy lines is ill-founded the enemy can withdraw and reform its lines too easily for his forces to break; and modern air power can only dominate a battlefield in the absence of an opposing modern air force. 

Clancy also incorporated the rumored F-19 stealth fighter into his plot. The existence of stealth aircraft was an open secret among aerospace watchers in the 1980s, but was highly classified at the time the novel was written. In actuality, computers of the day were not powerful enough to design the F-19 s curved surfaces, resulting instead in the simpler and more angular F-117 Nighthawk.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq, although far more of a mismatch than a late-1980s NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict would have been, did provide some evidence for Clancy's hypotheses. The US Army s Apaches proved more vulnerable to ground fire than had been predicted, and by the war s end the majority of close air support was being delivered by the more heavily armored A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft. Fittingly, Clancy identifies the A-10 as being a key weapon in his Red Storm Rising scenario. His predictions on the high rate of munitions expenditure also appears to have been borne out even though the initial attack on Iraq was short, it drained U.S. arsenals to an alarming extent, forcing the Pentagon to undertake a crash program to rebuild stocks of smart bombs.

Evidence for the prediction of high expenditures of munitions was already available from the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In this conflict both sides consumed munitions so rapidly that within one week of the start of combat, both the United States and the Soviet Union had to airlift munitions to their respective client states (Israel for the U.S., Egypt and Syria for the Soviet Union) to avoid a collapse of their respective armed forces.

Another point of interest is the use of America s Iowa-class battleships, which in the novel are sent to Iceland to support the United States Marines during their amphibious landing. The effective use of battleships in modern war was demonstrated during the 1991 Gulf War, when the Missouri and Wisconsin shelled shore-based artillery sites, antiship missile facilities, and Iraqi troop concentrations arrayed along the coasts of Iraq and Kuwait, and on Faylaka Island.

 Military studies .
Red Storm Rising is basic literature at many military academies inside and outside the United States, as are several other books by Tom Clancy. It is also frequently referred to by military scientists and is widely considered to be one of the most realistic representations of an imagined East-West war.

 Board game .
In 1989, TSR, Inc. released a board game designed by Douglas Niles, based on the book.  The game won the Origins Award for Best Modern-Day Boardgame of 1989 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame of 1989.

 Computer games .
There is also a computer game based on the book s scenario produced and released by MicroProse in the late 1980s. The player has a nuclear submarine in his command. It features adventure elements and a plot in addition to the simulation. The skill level can be changed by changing some of the initial conditions of the scenario. The game was released for the Amiga (released in 1990), Atari ST (1989), Commodore 64 (1988) and IBM-PC (circa 1989) home computers.

The game centers around the effects that submarine warfare would have on the World War III concept presented in the Tom Clancy book. There were two styles of play: Single missions, where one can select the general type of engagement they would fight; and the campaign, where a strategic map and issued missions added another layer of depth to the game.
 
Unlike other games at the time like the World War II simulation Silent Service, or EA s 688 Attack Sub, Red Storm Rising (RSR) was not as graphically based. The game centered around a screen that showed the  plots  of the ships, using the abstract symbols used by the USN. From this screen you could set a course, target your weapons, and see incoming fire. The enemy was not always clear however, as your passive sonar had to build up a  contact rating.  If this was below 90%, your contact would be  possible  and there would be a chance that the distance would be off, at higher levels sometimes by a very significant amount.

Other screens included a  acoustical signature  screen, where the  contact return  would show on the analyzer and one could match it to known signatures. A correct guess would boost the contact rating by 10% and put an ID tag on the ship icon. The  Oceanic  or  Sea Conditions  screen showed the current model of the acoustical conditions of the game area. It provided a depth view with concepts like the thermal layer to allow the player to  hide  by placing the submarine in a more advantageous acoustical position.

The game was very popular, but did not spawn a series of games like Silent Service or 688, mainly because the simple graphics were not as worthwhile to update as games moved into 3D. Still many consider it to be the most realistic portrayal of nuclear submarine combat, almost entirely dispensing with the notion of  periscope runs  in the face of modern sonar. 

In 2005 a group of enthusiasts released a modification for Close Combat 5 called  Red Storm Rising,  thus producing a real time strategy game that is loosely based on the novel. It was the first and only Close Combat 5 modification that is set in modern age. All graphics, and maps were made specifically for this mod and the result is rather professional. It is available for free download to owners of Close Combat videogame.

The plot for Red Storm Rising also inspired the choice of theatre and gameplay in Digital Image Design s EF2000.

In march of 2006 the Germany 1985 mod for the military simulation game Armed Assault was founded by a group of well known mod makers from the famous ArmA s predecessor: Operation Flashpoint. This mod will cover all aspects of Cold War-era warfare in Germany as described in Red Storm Rising.

The concept for the Germany 1985 mod was inspired by Red Storm Rising:


 The setting of Germany in 1985 was chosen because of the diversity of equipment and vehicles available, the relative parity of the NATO and Warsaw Pact forces and the exciting and well known back story provided by Tom Clancy.

Eläintarha (Swedish: Djurgården) is a large park in central Helsinki, Finland. The name "eläintarha" means "zoo".

The park's location acts as a divisor between the districts of Töölö to the west, and Hakaniemi and Kallio to the east. The southern half of the park includes two bays of the Baltic Sea: Töölönlahti to the west, and Eläintarhanlahti to the east. The railroad tracks running northwards from the Helsinki Central railway station run between these bays, effectively splitting the Eläintarha park in half.

At the north-western end of the park, near the district of Laakso, there is a sports arena called Eläintarhan urheilukenttä, or "Eltsu" as it is known to Helsinkians. From 1932 to 1963, the Eltsu arena hosted annual motorbike and racing car races, known as Eläintarhanajot or "Eltsunajot", but these were later cancelled as too dangerous.

Contrary to the name, there has never been a zoo in Eläintarha. There are two theories for the misleading name. The more popular one is that Henrik Borgström, who bought the park area in the middle of the 19th century, had announced plans to build a zoo there, and by the 1880s, the name Eläintarha had been established in advance, anticipating the zoo, which never materialised. The city of Helsinki bought the park from Borgström in 1877. Another theory is that the name is simply a translation from the Djurgården park in Stockholm, Sweden.

The real Helsinki zoo is located on the island of Korkeasaari.

<doc id="6737698" title="Parchman, Mississippi" nonfiltered="771" processed="763" dbindex="450779">
Parchman is a small town in Sunflower County, Mississippi in the Mississippi Delta region.  Best known as the home of Mississippi State Penitentiary, formerly called Parchman Farm, Parchman is the oldest prison and the only maximum security prison in the state.  Parchman also houses inmates who have been sentenced to death in Mississippi on death row. 

Instead of building a permanent execution chamber there, the state built the first portable electric chair in the United States, carried on a pickup truck and used until 1955, for executions at Parchman.

Description.
Located in the fertile Mississippi delta land, Parchman was the location of Mississippi's first prison, then called Parchman Farm because it was a working farm with the labor supplied by the inmates, then called convicts. Using convict labor for everything from raising cotton and other farm food products, to building railroads, to extracting turpentine gum from pine tree was common in the South then to use.  Parchman was and still is in prime cotton-growing country.  Inmates labored there in the fields raising cotton, soybeans and other cash crops, and the production of livestock, swine, poultry and milk.

Parchman Farm consisted of 20,000 acres (81 km²), broken down into fifteen work camps, each organized like a pre-Civil War plantation with prison personnel with guns serving as overseers,  and so-called inmate trustees driving the convict worker production.  The sale of produce and cotton from Parchman Farm was consistently  profitable for the state.

Landmark ruling.
In 1972 four inmates sued the superintendent of Parchman in federal court alleging violation of their civil rights under the United States Constitution.  In a landmark case known as Gates v. Collier, federal judge William C. Keady ruled in favor of the inmates.  He ordered an immediate end to all unconstitutional conditions and practices.  Racial segregation of inmates and the trustee system, which allowed certain inmates to have power and control over others, were abolished.

Music.
Many blues songs originated from the farm or those who spent time there. The song "Midnight Special" refers to a train leaving Jackson on Saturday nights carrying visitors to the prison for the allotted Sunday visits.

The famous John Lomax, accompanied by his wife, Ruby toured through the southern states recording blues work songs and other folk songs for the Library of Congress as part of a WPA project in 1939.  They recorded work songs and chants  while inmates were performing a group task, such as hoeing the fields at Parchman Farm as well as blues songs sung by inmate musicians.

Parchman today remains a small sleepy town.  The current census shows the population of Sunflower County declining between the years 2000 and 2003.

Susan R. Wolf is a moral philosopher. One of her books is Freedom Within Reason, which argues for a view of free will as the ability to do what one reasonably thinks is the right thing. This allows a deterministic universe to nevertheless contain responsibility and the feeling of autonomy for us. Wolf has also written on the topic of moral luck, suggesting a reconciliation between the rationalist and irrationalist positions.  She has also published influential work on the demandingness of morality.  In this area her paper "Moral Saints" has been particularly influential.

Wolf earned a BA from Yale University in philosophy and mathematics and a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University with a dissertation directed by Thomas Nagel.

Wolf taught at Harvard University, the University of Maryland, and the Johns Hopkins University before taking up her current position as professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Her husband, Douglas MacLean, is also a philosopher at UNC.

The languages of the European Union are languages used by people within the member states of the European Union. They include the 23 official languages of the European Union along with a range of others. The EU asserts on its EUROPA homepage: "Languages: Europe's asset" and has a special European Commissioner for Multilingualism, Leonard Orban.

In the European Union language policy is the responsibility of member states and EU does not have a common language policy; European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field. Based on the "principle of subsidiarity". 
their role is to promote cooperation between the member states and to promote the European dimension in the member states language policies. EU encourages all its citizens to be multilingual; specifically, it encourages them to be able to speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue. Though the EU has very limited influence in this area as the content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states, a number of EU funding programmes actively promote language learning and linguistic diversity.   

Official languages of the European Union.

The official languages of the European Union, as stipulated in the amended EEC Council: Regulation No 1 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community of 1958-04-15, are: 



The number of member states exceeds the number of official languages, as several national languages are shared by two or more countries. Namely, Dutch is official in the Netherlands and Belgium, French in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, German in Germany, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, and Greek in Greece and Cyprus. English and Swedish are also shared, the former by the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and the latter by Sweden and Finland, but the fact that they are co-official in Ireland and Finland, with Irish and Finnish respectively, means that the overall ratio of member states to national languages is unaffected.

Furthermore, not all national languages have been accorded the status of official EU languages. These include Luxembourgish, an official language of Luxembourg since 1984, and Turkish, an official language of Cyprus.

All languages of the EU are also working languages. Documents which a Member State or a person subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State sends to institutions of the Community may be drafted in any one of the official languages selected by the sender. The reply shall be drafted in the same language. Regulations and other documents of general application shall be drafted in the twenty-three official languages. The Official Journal of the European Union shall be published in the twenty-three official languages.

Legislation and documents of major public importance or interest are produced in all 23 official languages, but that accounts for a minority of the institutions' work. Other documents (e.g. communications with the national authorities, decisions addressed to particular individuals or entities and correspondence) are translated only into the languages needed. For internal purposes the EU institutions are allowed by law to choose their own language arrangements. The European Commission, for example, conducts its internal business in three languages, English, French and German, and goes fully multilingual only for public information and communication purposes. The European Parliament, on the other hand, has Members who need working documents in their own languages, so its document flow is fully multilingual from the outset.

According to the EU's English language website, the cost of maintaining the instutions' policy of multilingualism (i.e. the cost of translation and interpretation) is ¤1123 million, which is 1% of the annual general budget of the EU, or ¤2.28 per person per year.

Status of lesser-used languages.
There has been a suggestion in an official briefing that the implicit principle for official languages of the European Union is that each member state can put forward at most one official language ('one member state, one language').  This has not been confirmed in documents.

The Spanish and Irish governments have sought the status of 'official' EU languages for Basque, Catalan, Galician, and Irish. The 2667th Council Meeting of the Council of the European Union in Luxembourg on 13 June 2005 decided to authorise limited use at EU level of languages recognised by Member States other than the official working languages. Besides making Irish the 21st official language, the council also granted recognition to "languages other than the languages referred to in Council Regulation No 1/1958 whose status is recognised by the Constitution of a Member State on all or part of its territory or the use of which as a national language is authorised by law."  The official use of such languages will be authorised on the basis of an administrative arrangement concluded between the Council and the requesting Member State. 

Luxembourgish, an official language of Luxembourg, and Turkish, an official language of Cyprus, have not used yet this provision.

Irish.
Although the Irish language has been one of the official languages of the European Union only since January 1 2007, it is the Republic of Ireland's first official language, and has minority-language status in Northern Ireland. Since the Republic of Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1973, EU treaties have been published and authenticated in Irish - as an official treaty language - as well as the EU official languages, and one has been able to make written submissions to Union institutions in Irish. On 13 June 2005, following a unanimous decision by EU foreign ministers, it was announced that Irish would be made the 21st official language of the EU but a derogation stipulates that not all documents have to be translated into Irish as is the case with the other official languages.  The decision means that legislation approved by both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers will now be translated into Irish, and interpretation from Irish will be available at European Parliament plenary sessions and some Council meetings. The new arrangements came into effect on 1 January, 2007. The cost of translation, interpretation, publication and legal services involved in making Irish an official EU language is estimated at just under ¤3.5 million a year.  The derogation will be reviewed in four years and every five years thereafter.

Irish is the only official language of the Union that is not the most widely spoken language in any member state - 2002 census figures show that in the Republic of Ireland there are 1,570,894 speakers of Irish out of a population of 4,351,292, though only 350,000 use Irish every day ,the majority of whom are schoolchildren. It is also estimated that 165,000 people in Northern Ireland can speak Irish. There are small but slowly growing diaspora communities that speak Irish around the world, the largest being in the United States, with 25,000 Irish speakers. 

Catalan, Galician, and Basque.
Although Catalan, Galician and Basque are not nation-wide official languages in Spain, as co-official languages in the respective regions they are eligible to benefit from official use in EU institutions under the terms of the 13 June 2005 resolution of the Council of the European Union. The Spanish government has assented to the provisions in respect of these languages.

The status of Catalan, spoken by many millions of citizens, has been the subject of particular debate. On 11 December 1990, the use of Catalan was the subject of a European Parliament Resolution (resolution A3-169/90  on languages in the (European) Community and the situation of Catalan (OJ-C19, 28 January 1991).

On November 16 2005, the Committee of the Regions President Peter Straub signed an agreement with the Spanish Ambassador to the EU, Carlos Sagües Bastarreche, approving the use of Spanish regional languages in an EU institution for the first time in a meeting on that day, with interpretation provided by European Commission interpreters.  

On July 3 2006, the European Parliament s Bureau approved a proposal by the Spanish State to allow citizens to address the European Parliament in Basque, Catalan and Galician, two months after its initial rejection.  

On November 30 2006, the European Ombudsman, Nikiforos Diamandouros, and the Spanish ambassador in the EU, Carlos Bastarreche, signed an agreement in Brussels to allow Spanish citizens to address complains to the European Ombudsman in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician, all three co-official languages in Spain.  According to the agreement, a translation body, which will be set up and financed by the Spanish government, will be responsible for translating complaints submitted in these languages. In turn, it will translate the Ombudsman's decisions from Spanish/Castilian into the language of the complainant. Until such a body is established the agreement will not become effective.

Welsh and Scottish Gaelic.
In response to a written parliamentary question tabled following the 2005-06-13 resolution on official use of regional languages, the UK Minister for Europe, Douglas Alexander, stated on 2005-06-29 that "The Government have no current plans to make similar provisions for UK languages."

Provision in the proposed constitutional treaty.
The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was drafted in the 21 official treaty languages of the EU (the official languages, plus Irish), in the languages of three candidate countries: Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish (the former two have now joined the union). It contains the following provision: 

Article IV-448(2): This Treaty may also be translated into any other languages as determined by Member States among those which, in accordance with their constitutional order, enjoy official status in all or part of their territory.  A certified copy of such translations shall be provided by the Member States concerned to be deposited in the archives of the Council.

Note that the Constitution has been signed by all Member States and is in the ratification process. Following its rejection in referenda in France and the Netherlands, as matters stand it will not come into force.

Migrant languages.
Migrant languages are not given formal status or recognition in the EU or in the EU countries and
they are not covered by EU language-teaching programmes. Only national and local authorities may 
provide classes to help immigrants learn the language of their adopted country. 

National sign languages in the European Union.
Roughly one person in one thousand uses a national sign language as a first language, however there are many more that use one as their second language. An increasing number of countries have some form of recognition of their national sign language such as Belgium with Flemish Sign Language (VGT) and Belgian-French Sign Language (LSFB), the United Kingdom with British Sign Language (BSL). In Northern Ireland, Irish Sign Language (ISL) and Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL) are recognised as official languages.

On 1988-06-17, the European Parliament unanimously approved a Resolution about national Sign Languages. This resolution asks all Member States for recognition of their national sign languages as official languages which would bring better linguistic rights and protection for sign language users especially the deaf users of sign language.

Language skills of European Union citizens.


The following tables are based on "Special Eurobarometer 243" of the European Commission with the title "Europeans and their Languages" (summary full text), published on February 2006 with research carried out on November and December 2005. The survey was published before the 2007 Enlargement of the European Union, when Bulgaria and Romania acceded. This is a poll, not a census. 28,694 citizens with a minimum age of 15 were asked in the then 25 member-states as well as in the then future member-states (Bulgaria, Romania) and the candidate countries (Croatia, Turkey) at the time of the survey. Only citizens, not immigrants, were asked.

The first table shows what proportion of citizens said that they could have a conversation in each language as their mother tongue and as a second language or foreign language (only the languages with at least 2% of the speakers are listed): 



German is, then, the most widely spoken mother tongue with 17% of the speakers, while English is the most widely spoken language in the EU with 50%. One should also note that 100% of the Hungarians, 100% of the Portuguese, and 99% of the Greeks speak the state language as their mother tongue. 

The knowledge of foreign languages varies considerably in the specific countries, as the table below shows. The three most spoken second or foreign languages in the EU are English, German and French. When no rate is noted, the language is not one of the three most spoken second or foreign languages in this country.


Source: , data for EU25, published before 2007 enlargement.


56% of citizens in the EU Member States are able to hold a conversation in one language apart from their mother tongue. This is 9 points more than was perceived in 2001 among the 15 Member States at the time . 28% of the respondents state that they speak two foreign languages well enough to have a conversation. Still, almost half of the respondents, 44%, admit not knowing any other language than their mother tongue. Approximately 1 in 5 Europeans can be described as an active language learner, i.e. someone who has recently improved his/her language skills or intends to do so over the following 12 months.

English remains the most widely spoken foreign language throughout Europe. 38% of EU citizens state that they have sufficient skills in English to have a conversation (apart from the citizens of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the two English-speaking countries). 14% of Europeans indicate that they know either French or German along with their mother tongue. French is most commonly studied and used in Southern Europe, especially in Mediterranean countries, in Germany, Romania, the UK and Ireland while German is commonly studied and used in the Benelux countries, in Scandinavia and in the newer EU member states. In 19 out of 29 countries polled, English is the most widely known language apart from the mother tongue, this being particularly the case in Sweden (89%), Malta (an ex-British colony) (88%) and the Netherlands (87%), while German and French is so in three countries. Moreover, the citizens of the EU think they speak English at a better level than any other second or foreign language. 77% of EU citizens believe that children should learn English and that it s considered the number one language to learn in all countries where the research conducted but the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Luxembourg.

All in all, English either as a mother tongue or as a second/foreign language is spoken by 51% of EU citizens, followed by German with 32% and French with 28% of those asked.

With the enlargement of the European Union, the balance between French and German is slowly changing. Clearly more citizens in the new Member States master German (23% compared with 12% in the EU15) while their skills in French and Spanish are scarce (3% and 1% respectively compared with 16% and 7% among the EU15 group). A notable exception is Romania, where 24% of the population speaks French as a foreign language compared to 6% who speaks German as a foreign language (also 4% of the population speaks Italian as a foreign language, while 3% of the population speaks Spanish as a foreign language).

It is worth pointing out that language skills are unevenly distributed both over the geographical area of Europe and over sociodemographic groups. Reasonably good language competences are perceived in relatively small Member States with several state languages, lesser used native languages or "language exchange  with neighbouring countries. This is the case for example in Luxembourg where 92% speak at least two languages. Those who live in Southern European countries or countries where one of the major European languages is a state language appear to have moderate language skills. Only 5% of Turkish, 13% of Irish and 16%
Italians master at least two languages apart from their mother tongue. A "multilingual" European is likely to be young, well-educated or still studying, born in a country other than the country of residence, who uses foreign languages for professional reasons and is motivated to learn. Consequently, it seems that a large part of European society is not enjoying the advantages of multilingualism.

Free language lessons (26%), flexible language courses that suit one s schedule (18%) and opportunities to learn languages in a country where it is spoken natively (17%) are considered to be the main incentives encouraging language learning. Group lessons with a teacher (20%), language lessons at school (18%),  one-to-one  lessons with a teacher and long or frequent visits to a country
where the language is spoken are considered to be the most suitable ways to learn languages.

Regional and Minority Languages.
Besides the languages of the Republic of Ireland, Spain and the UK (see above), there are other regional or minority languages spoken within the EU that do not have official recognition at EU level. Some of them may have some official status within the member state and count many more speakers than some of the lesser-used official languages.  These include:



In this list constructed languages or dialects of an official language of member states are not included.

Russian.
Though not an official language of the European Union, Russian is widely spoken in some of the newer member states of the Union that were formerly in the Eastern bloc. Russian is the native language of about 1.3 million Slavs residing in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, as well as a sizable community in Germany. Russian is also understood by many ethnic Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians, since it was a compulsory subject of many curricula in these countries during the Soviet era. Although rarely a native language, Russian is widely understood by many in Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, some in Hungary, Romania and other countries. It is the 8th most spoken language in the EU. About 7% of all EU citizens speak or understand Russian to some extent.

Migrant languages.
A wide variety of languages from other parts of the world are spoken by immigrant communities in EU countries. Turkish is spoken as a first language by an estimated 2% of the population in Belgium and the western part of Germany and by 1% in The Netherlands. Other widely-used migrant languages include Maghreb Arabic (mainly in France and Belgium), Urdu, Bengali and Hindi spoken by immigrants from the Indian sub-continent in the United Kingdom, while Balkan languages are spoken in many parts of the EU by migrants and refugees who have left the region as a result of the recent wars and unrest there.

Many immigrant communities in the EU have been in place for several generations now and their members
are bilingual, at ease both in the local language and in that of their community. 

Linguistic classification of the EU official languages.
The majority of the official languages of the European Union belong to the Indo-European language family, the three dominant subfamilies being the Germanic, Romance and Slavic languages. Germanic languages are widely spoken in central and northern areas of the EU and include Danish, Dutch, English, German, and Swedish. Romance languages are spoken in western and southern regions and include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. The Slavic languages are to be found in the eastern regions and include Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Slovak, and Slovene. The Baltic languages Latvian and Lithuanian, the Celtic language Irish, and Greek are also of Indo-European origin. Outside the Indo-European family, Estonian, Finnish, and 
Hungarian are Finno-Ugric languages while Maltese is the only Semitic language with official status in the EU. All official EU languages except Greek (written with the Greek alphabet) and Bulgarian (written in the Cyrillic alphabet) are written with the Latin alphabet.

EU initiatives for language learning and linguistic diversity.

Beginning with the Lingua programme in 1990, the European Union invests more than ¤30 million a year (out of a ¤120 billion EU budget) promoting language learning through the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes in: bursaries to enable language teachers to be trained abroad, placing foreign language assistants in schools, funding class exchanges to motivate pupils to learn languages, creating new language courses on CDs and the Internet and projects that raise awareness of the benefits of language learning. 

Through strategic studies, the Commission promotes debate, innovation and the exchange of good practice. In addition, the mainstream actions of Community programmes which encourage mobility and transnational partnerships motivate participants to learn languages.

Youth exchanges, town twinning projects and the European Voluntary Service also promote multilingualism. Since 1997, the Culture 2000 programme has financed the translation of around 2,000 literary works from and into European languages.

The new programmes proposed for implementation for the financial perspective 2007-2013 (Culture 2007, Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning) will continue and develop this kind of support.

In addition, the EU provides the main financial support to the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (a non-governmental organisation which represents the interests of the over 40 million citizens who belong to a regional and minority language community), and for the Mercator networks of universities active in research on lesser-used languages in Europe. Following a request from the European Parliament, the Commission in 2004 launched a feasibility study on the possible creation of a new EU agency, "European Agency for Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity". The study concludes that there are unmet needs in this field, and proposes two options: creating an agency or setting up a European network of "Language Diversity Centres". The Commission believes that a network would be the most appropriate next step and, where possible, should build on existing structures; it will examine the possibility of financing it on a multi-annual basis through the proposed Lifelong Learning programme.

Although not an EU treaty, some EU member states have ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Its ratification is also a prerequisite for new member-states joining the Union.

To encourage language learning, the EU supported the Council of Europe initiatives for European Year of Languages 2001 and the annual celebration of European Day of Languages on September 26.

To encourage the member states to cooperate and to disseminate best practice the Commission has issued a Communication on July 24, 2003, on Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: an Action Plan 2004 - 2006 (summary) and a Communication on November 22, 2005, on A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism (summary).

From November 22 2004, the European Commissioner for Education and Culture portfolio included an explicit reference to languages and became European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism with Ján Fige  at the post. From January 1, 2007, the European Commission has a special portfolio on languages, European Commissioner for Multilingualism. The post is currently held by Leonard Orban.

EU devotes a specialised subsite of its "Europa" portal to languages, the EUROPA Languages portal.

Chris Wright (born January 7, 1971) is an American professional wrestler, better known by the ring name, C.W. Anderson. He is best known for his run in Extreme Championship Wrestling .

Career.
Wright grew up in The Carolinas and was an ardent fan of the National Wrestling Alliance, admiring wrestlers such as Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes and Bobby Eaton. Upon his graduation from high school in 1989, Wright was drafted by the San Diego Padres as a catcher, but rejected the offer, instead choosing to attended college, where he studied computing while played baseball and softball. 

After graduating from college, Wright sought a new weekend sport to replace baseball. Several of his friends were wrestling professionally, and Wright decided to become a professional wrestler as well. With no formal training, he wrestled (and lost) his first match on December 4, 1993, under a mask. While wrestling on the independent circuit, Wright was approached by Pat and Rocky Anderson, who complimented him on his skills and appearance and offered him membership in the apocryphal . Anderson spent two weeks trying to think of an appropriate forename, eventually settling on his initials, C.W., at the suggestion of an interviewer; he thus became C.W. Anderson. Anderson later met Ole Anderson but claimed that he was disillusioned by the experience. Anderson formed a tag team with Pat Anderson, winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship with him in 1996.   

In 1996, Anderson opened his own professional wrestling school in Smithfield, North Carolina, which he later named "The Anderson Academy" where he trained wrestlers such as Chilly Willy, Lodi and Toad. 

In 1998, Anderson trained at the World Championship Wrestling run Power Plant under Dwayne Bruce and Pez Whatley. While there he was told by J.J. Dillon and Paul Orndorff that he lacked the talent and physique to become successful as a wrestler. After spending eighteen months in the Power Plant without being utilized on WCW television, Anderson opted to leave the Power Plant, turning down a six year WCW contract offer.  

Extreme Championship Wrestling.
On June 6, 1999, Anderson accompanied a friend to an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) tryout in Georgia and was convinced to get in the ring by Nova. His work impressed ECW owner Paul Heyman, and Anderson was hired. In his first match for ECW, Anderson teamed with Skull Von Krush against Danny Doring and Roadkill.    

In ECW, Anderson formed the New Dangerous Alliance with Wild Bill Wiles, Elektra and Lou E. Dangerously. After that group separated, Anderson joined forces with Simon and Swinger.

On January 7, 2001 at the final ECW pay-per-view, Guilty As Charged 2001, Anderson lost to Tommy Dreamer in an "I Quit" match. As part of his preparation for the bout, Anderson watched the "I Quit" match between Magnum T.A. and Tully Blanchard from StarrCade 1985.

Independent circuit.
Following the closure of ECW, Anderson wrestled in Dusty Rhodes's Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling, where he formed The Xtreme Horsemen, a stable modelled after The Four Horsemen, with Barry Windham and Steve Corino. The stable later wrestled in Major League Wrestling, where they were joined by P.J. Polaco and Simon Diamond.  Anderson also wrestled for Ring of Honor and various independent promotions in North Carolina. 

From 2002 onwards, Anderson made numerous tours of Japan, most prominently for Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX (in May 2006, he had toured with the company on 36 separate occasions). In 2004, he was given a tryout match by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, but was not hired.   

On June 10, 2005, Anderson appeared at Hardcore Homecoming, an ECW reunion event organised by Shane Douglas. The event saw Anderson team with Simon Diamond in a loss to Chris Chetti and Mikey Whipwreck. He went on to appear at Hardcore Homecoming events in September 2005 and November 2005.

Anderson was hospitalized in 2005 after a supplement named Superdrol gave him jaundice and caused his liver to stop functioning. He returned to the ring after several months, during which he lost 40 lb (18 kg) in weight. In March 2006, Superdrol was banned by the Food and Drug Administration. 

World Wrestling Entertainment.
Throughout 2004 and 2005, Anderson made numerous appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment, wrestling in dark matches and on Velocity. On June 12, 2005, he appeared at the WWE promoted ECW reunion show ECW One Night Stand, sitting at ringside next to Chris Chetti and Elektra. 

In 2006, on May 4, 2006, Anderson and several other Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni were hired by WWE to work on their new brand, ECW. Throughout June and July, Anderson wrestled at ECW house shows and in ECW on Sci Fi dark matches. On August 1, he became known as Christopher W. Anderson. He made what would be his only ECW television debut on August 22, 2006, losing to CM Punk.

On January 18, 2007, Anderson was released by WWE.

Cornubia is a suburb of Logan City, Queensland, Australia. It is situated 29 kilometres south-east of Brisbane. The nearest largest landmark is the Logan Hyperdome shopping centre - one of the largest undercover shopping malls in Queensland.

Cornubia is considered one of the most sought after suburbs in Logan City due to its bush setting and closeness to major shops (Logan Hyperdome) and first class educational institutions (John Paul College). 

Many street names reflect its lush bush setting (e.g. Sugarwood, Parkview). Cornubia is the Latin name for Cornwall.

 Fauna .
Cornubia is part of the Koala Coast and is home to hundreds of Australian native animals including koalas, kangaroos, goannas and various species of birds (e.g. Rainbow Lorikeet).

Demographics.
As of 2001, the population of Cornubia was around 3300. 10 years prior there were only 2000 people in the area. The suburb has a young population (median age of 35). About 6% of people are unemployed. Over 70% of employed people travel by car which reflects the lack of efficient and cost-effective public transport. All public transport in the area is controlled by Clarks' Buses, a privately owned company.

After English (90%), the most spoken languages are Dutch and German.

<doc id="4495296" title="Berkley High School" nonfiltered="783" processed="775" dbindex="450791">
Berkley High School is a public high school in Berkley, Michigan with a 2005-2006 enrollment of 1,348 students. Berkley High's colors are maroon and blue and the school nickname is the Bears. Berkley is well known for its college prep courses, high standardized test scores and teachers and administrators. Their athletic teams compete in the Oakland Activities Association (OAA).  The principal is Derrick Lopez. 

Berkley High School has been accredited by the Michigan North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement since the 1928-29 school year.

Extracurricular.
The newspaper is The Spectator, which is a member of the High School National Ad Network.
The Berkley High School A Cappella Choir has been invited to sing in Carnegie Hall in New York City, but is working on efforts to raise $40,000 to cover travel expenses related to the trip, where they will be scheduled to to perform Beethoven's Mass in C on May 22, 2007. The choir was selected based on their first division ratings in the 2006 Michigan State High School Choral Festival.;

Sports.

Berkley's athletic teams currently compete in the Oakland Activities Association (OAA) with the exception of the Rugby teams (club) and the Prep/JV hockey team (Southeast Michigan Prep Hockey League).  Paul Yowchuang became the Athletic Director in 2006.  Yowchuang proceeds Bob Gershman, who lives in Oak Park, served as athletic director for a number of years.  Paul Yowchuang (Chinese or Japanese?) is the former varsity Cross-Country coach and currently is still a coach of the varsity Track and Field team as well as a teacher at the high school.

Berkley has been very successful in recent years in Boys' Soccer, Boys' Basketball, Boys' Swimming, Boy's Hockey, and Boys' and Girls' Track and Field - All of which have won at least one league championship from 2003-2006.  Berkley is currently in a very successful period in terms of athletics although the football team has not had success in many years.  Boys' Basketball is quickly becoming the most popular sport among the students and spectators.  Yet, homecoming football games draw so many students and alumni that the stands get filled over capacity.

The Boys' and Girls' Track and Field teams are experiencing the school's best stretch in many years and possibly the best stretch in school history.  From 2004 through the 2006 season, the girls' track and field team has a record of 19-1 (18-1 OAA III) in dual meet competition.  This was a huge turn-around because from 2001-2003 the girls had a 7-15 dual meet record.  They won the OAA Division III championship in 2005 and 2006(tie).  The boys' track and field team has experienced similar success with a record of 18-2 (17-2 OAA III) from 2004 through 2006.  The boys won the OAA Division III championship in 2005 and 2006 as well.  The boys' team has a 17 meet winning streak in duals and the girls' team has a 16 meet winning streak in duals heading into the 2007 season.  Both teams have been moved up to OAA Division II because of recent and continued success.  Since 2001, the boys' team has posted new records in 9 of the 16 meet events that they compete in and 5 since 2004.  Since 2001, the girls' team has posted 7 new records in the 16 meet events they compete in and and 6 since 2005.  In fact, unofficially, more records have been broken in that time period because the records in standing are the final result of many individuals or relay teams breaking their own records over the course of a season/high school career.

Although the school nickname is "Bears," the boys' and girls' Swimming and Diving teams are known as the "Bearracudas" or "Cudas."  The Bearracuda boys are coached by Berkley alumni Jeremy Landa and Todd Seidl and the divers are coached by long-time faculty member Ron Kinas.  The girl Bearracudas' head coach is Berkley alumnus Ashley Seidl (nee Braun) with assistants Todd Seidl and Diane Meitzner.  

Their basketball court is known as the "Bear's Den" and the student section at basketball games is proudly know as the "Catalpa Crazies" because the main entrance to the court and school is on Catalpa Drive which runs through the middle of the city.

The Berkley football team, soccer teams, and track teams compete at Hurley field located a  just less than a half-mile away from the school.  The field recieved renovations during the spring of 2002 and re-opened with many new facilities at the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year.  The field is also used for many other high school tournaments and semi-pro soccer leagues.  Next to Hurley Field is Pop Lewis field where the high school baseball games are held along with other community baseball leagues.  The Softball teams play at the two neigboring fields to Pop Lewis field.  The Tennis Courts are located next to Hurley Field as well.  Berkley Varsity Hockey and JV/Prep Hockey compete at the Berkley Ice Arena, which is also adjacent to Hurley Field and Tennis Courts.  Cross-Country competes at Catalpa Park, which is about a mile from the school and half mile from Hurley field.  Golf competes at Rackham golf course in the neighboring town of Huntington Woods.  Bowling competes at Hartfield lanes.  The rest of the teams compete within the school building or outside (rugby) on other school grounds.

 Girls' golf is being added to the list of varsity sports in the spring of 2007.

 The school's arch rival has long been considered Kimball High School in the neighboring city of Royal Oak, Michigan.  Yet, since Royal Oak Dondero High School joined Kimball at the end of the 2005-2006 school year and became Royal Oak High School, some feel that the rivalry is not the same as it used to be, but still noone gives a shit.;

 Girls' Basketball;
 Bowling;

<doc id="1506188" title="Díthorba" nonfiltered="784" processed="776" dbindex="450792">
In Irish Mythology Díthorba or Diothorba was a High King of Ireland. He ruled in rotation with his cousins Áed Ruad and Cimbáeth, each ruling for seven years in turn. Each ruled for three seven-year periods.

Áed had died at the end of his third stint in the kingship, and when Cimbáeth completed his third seven-year period, Áed's daughter Macha demanded the kingship in her father's place. Díthorba and Cimbáeth refused, but Macha defeated them on the battlefield. Díthorba was killed in Connacht, and his sons were forced to build Emain Macha.

Macha went on to marry Cimbáeth, and they ruled for another seven years until Cimbáeth died, and Macha became the only queen in her own right in the List of High Kings of Ireland.

 is a series of science fiction novels by Yoshiki Tanaka. An anime adaptation of the novels ran from 1988 to 1997, and a manga is also based on the novels, with art by Katsumi Michihara. 

Neither the novel, anime nor manga have been released officially in the English language, but there exists an unofficial fansub of the anime. For that reason most English-speaking fans identify Legend of the Galactic Heroes with the anime.

Set somewhere in distant space around the 35th century (the 9th century of the story's "Space Era"), Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a story of the epic struggle between the monarchic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance.

Alternative titles.
Original title is often abbreviated as Gin'eiden (   );
Die Legende Der Sternhelden;
Legend of Galactic Heroes (often abbreviated as Logh, LoGH, LGH, or LOGH);
Heldensagen vom Kosmosinsel (German, or better 'Fake German', using correct German grammar the title would be 'Heldensagen von der Kosmosinsel' and that wordly translated in English would be 'Heroic tales from the cosmic island');
Les Héros de la Galaxie (French);

The story.

Cover of the original novel of "Legend of the Galactic Heroes" volume 1, first edition (Tokuma Novels, 1982). This book is considered valuable and famous because the character of the volume number came to attach since the second edition.]]
The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, approximately in the 35th century. Unlike most other science fiction stories, there are no alien civilizations. A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.

Within the Galactic Empire, based on 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.

In the Free Planets Alliance is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian, and joined the military only because he needed money for tuition. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because of his demonstrated excellence in military strategy. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another.

As a historian, Yang often narrates the rich "future history" of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: "There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good."

Besides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters, from high nobility, admirals and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers, are interweaved into the story. There is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire called the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) which trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which claims that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.


Manga.


The manga edition is authored by Katsumi Michihara, and is derived from the first two volumes of the original-novel. 

This manga story is faithful to the original, possible more faithful than the anime. However, there are some changes that could be considered major, e.g. the sex of several characters is changed.

Akira Kasahara is cooperating in drawing mechanics.




Anime adaptations.



Series.
The anime series is based on novels. The anime is made of 110 25-minute episodes (divided into 4 sections). The first episode was released on home video in December 1988, and the last in January 1997. Since Legend of the Galactic Heroes was released directly to home video and not shown on TV first, it is technically an OVA (quite possibly the longest ever).  However, it has since been shown on TV several times.  There are three two-hour movies and two series of side stories (Gaiden) which are both prequels:
 Legend of Galactic Heroes: My Conquest is the Sea of Stars - Movie, 1988;
 Legend of Galactic Heroes: Golden Wings - OVA, 1992;
 Legend of Galactic Heroes: Overture to a New War - Movie, 1993;
 Legend of Galactic Heroes Side Stories (1st season) - OVA, 24 episodes, 1998   1999;
 Legend of Galactic Heroes Side Stories (2nd season) - OVA, 28 episodes, 1999   2000;
The series, while over 10 years old, has not been released officially with English dubbing nor subtitles and is only available on in Japanese, Chinese or English fansubs. Even so, it has been highly ranked on most international sites about anime and/or space opera.

Voice actors.
Legend of The Galactic Heroes boasts the largest voice cast for any known animated production. It has been said that the cast listing is a Who's Who for almost every veteran and current Japanese voice actor, known as seiy . For some voice actors in the series, this was their "breakthrough" role.  Most notably Ryo Horikawa, as Reinhard, went on to star as the voice of Vegeta in the long running Dragonball Z.

This series also features a large number of primarily live action actors. As an example, Masane Tsugayama (Ernst von Eisenach) and Morio Kazama (Bruce Ashbey) etc. are famous live actors in Japan. 

Yang Wen-li was the last role performed by veteran actor Kei Tomiyama who died in 1995 shortly after the end of the original series completion. His other most well known roles include Susumu Kodai from Space Battleship Yamato and Tochiro Oyama from Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999.

<doc id="1751017" title="Hampshire County Cricket Club in 2005" nonfiltered="788" processed="780" dbindex="450796">


Hampshire County Cricket Club played their cricket in Division One of both the County Championship and the National League in 2005. They started the season at 10-1 odds to win the Championship. With the first eleven including seven players who had represented their country at Test or ODIs at the end of the season, they nearly won the County Championship, beating eventual County Champions Nottinghamshire both home and away, and ended with the same win-loss record as Notts. However, with two bonus points less and half a point deducted due to a slow over rate against Sussex in July, they finished behind - something that had been apparent the week before the Championship ended. They did win the C&G Trophy, defeating three League Division Two sides and a minor county on the way to the title, in addition to Glamorgan from Division One, but their other limited-overs forays ended in relegation (in the League) and elimination due to head-to-head results in the Twenty20 Cup.

Hampshire played 16 first class games in 2005, winning nine, drawing four and losing three. They also played  22 List A games, winning ten, losing ten and abandoning two, while eight Twenty20 games ended in three wins, two losses, two no results and one abandoned match.

Match details.
April.
The first game in the Championship was a narrow 48 run victory against Gloucestershire. This was followed by a rain-affected defeat against Essex in the Sunday League. The second Championship game was a close draw against Sussex - the sort of game where Championships are won. However, surprisingly, with 29 needed off 34 balls with 2 wickets remaining, captain Shane Warne put up shop, securing the 4 points, but giving up the opportunity of 14. They then easily defeated the students of Cardiff UCCE. 

County Championship: Hampshire v Gloucestershire (13-16 April).
Hampshire (17pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by 48 runs

Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat. There were 1,200 at the Rose Bowl to watch Simon Katich flawless 72 not out, as he was the only one able to cope with the conditions as Hampshire were all out for 197 before tea. Katich's innings was one of defence coupled with the odd drive, hook and pull. Hampshire's meagre total suggests they miss Kevin Pietersen, who performed so well for England in the one-dayers against Zimbabwe and South Africa over the winter. Pietersen said of his foot injury, "If I got a ball on my foot or I slipped I could be out for six to eight weeks. It's a bit tender and it's just a case of biding my time," he said. However, they did have to face good, fast-medium-pace bowling from Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire fared well in reply, and Shane Warne brought himself into the attack after only 18 overs. He took Craig Spearman's wicket when Spearman tried to sweep him, but Gloucestershire were sitting pretty at close on 118 for 2, 79 behind with 8 first innings wickets remaining. 

On the second day, Hampshire's bowlers, led by Warne, battled hard to get them back into the game. Except for Jon Lewis, who scored 40 off 61 balls batting at number ten, no-one after the first three Gloucester batsmen scored more than ten. Their first innings ended for 221, just 24 ahead. Hampshire also struggled, and scored only 94 for their first 6 wickets. Warne and Sean Ervine survived the last six overs to push the score to 111 for 6 at close.

The third day saw yet another change in fortunes, which just about left Hampshire on top. The bowlers dominated the first two days, but the start of the third day was dominated by Hampshire's bowlers batting. Warne increased his score to 62, Chris Tremlett got 64 and Richard Logan 28 through aggressive batting as Hampshire closed their second innings on 275. This left Gloucestershire a challenging target of 252. Spearman and Phil Weston then put on 129 for the first wicket, only for five wickets to fall in quick succession before bad light stopped play, with the visitors on 149 for 5, needing 103 for victory.

It took only 18.4 overs on the fourth day for the match to be settled. With Billy Taylor finishing on 6 for 45 as Gloucester were all out for 203. After the game Hampshire's captain, Shane Warne, said, "We believe we can win from any position and it's so important to win your first few games. It was a tremendous team effort and everyone pulled their weight. This is the type of game you never forget. We found ourselves behind the eight ball at the start of every day but I always felt we were in with a chance if we could remove their openers." Cricinfo scorecard

National League: Hampshire v Essex (17 April).
Essex (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 16 runs (D/L method)

At the Rose Bowl, Hampshire Hawks batted first, scoring 175 for 9, as Tim Phillips took 3 for 31. It was a good day for spin, with Grant Flower also taking 2 wickets. In reply, Essex Eagles' Will Jefferson was 44 not out, and Essex 69 for 2 off 16 overs when rain put an end to play, leaving Essex the winners on the Duckworth-Lewis method. England's star one-day player of the winter, Kevin Pietersen, managed only 5 off 14 balls for Hampshire before being bowled. (BBC scorecard)

County Championship: Sussex v Hampshire (20-23 April).
Sussex (9pts) drew with Hampshire (9pts)

Hampshire finished the first day on top at Hove. Sussex, despite a century from Michael Yardy, were all out for 252, with Chris Tremlett taking 6 for 44. In reply, the visitors reached 67 for 1. Only for the position to be reversed on the second day, as they were dismissed for 280, with James Kirtley claiming 4 and Robin Martin-Jenkins 3 wickets. Sussex finished on 101 for 2. 

The game remained evenly poised on the third day, but with Sussex slightly in the lead, with rain predicted for the fourth. Sussex took their score on to 312, thereby setting a target of 285. Hampshire were on 89 for 3 at the end of day three. With rain predicted on the fourth day, the game could have gone any one of four ways. Kevin Pietersen (61), assisted by Sean Ervine (57), took the challenge to Sussex - and the game was always in the balance. When the eighth wicket fell, the score was on 256 for 8. And with 29 required off 34 balls, the game looked set for one of those exciting finishes that only the longer form of the game can provide. Disappointingly for the crowd, Hampshire captain Shane Warne ordered his batsmen to shut up shop. Sussex were unable to take the final two wickets, and on 267 for 8, the game was drawn. Hampshire finished the day second behind Warwickshire, but the ten points given up here had crucial repercussions later on in the season. (Cricinfo scorecard)

MCC University Match: Hampshire v Cardiff UCCE (27-29 April).
Hampshire beat Cardiff UCCE by 95 runs

On the first, rain-affected day Hampshire progressed to 299 for 4 off 76 overs, with Michael Brown putting on 93 at the Rose Bowl. On day 2, Hampshire declared on their overnight score and bowled out Cardiff UCCE. Cardiff UCCE's Christopher Salmons scored 84 not out, an innings that included six fours and five sixes, which made up nearly half of the students' total of 169. Hampshire were 80 for 3, 210 runs ahead, at close. On the third and final day Hampshire declared on 146 for 6, setting a target of 277. Wickets fell at regular intervals, and there was just enough time for Cardiff UCCE to be bowled out for a second time for 181. (BBC scorecard)

May.
On the Sunday after, however, they were thrashed by the Northamptonshire Steelbacks. The next day, they lost heavily to the Gloucestershire Gladiators. On 4 May Hampshire eased past Shropshire to progress to Round Two of the C&G Trophy. They then drew over 4 days against Kent, missing their chance of going top of the table by 1 wicket. Their first win in the Sunday League came on the 15th of May, beating Middlesex at Lord's, and they carried their good one-day form into the midweek, beating Glamorgan by six wickets. They then won a rain-affected match against the same team by nine wickets in the Championship, before going down to Warwickshire by ten wickets inside two days. This meant they finished May second in the Championship table.

National League: Northamptonshire v Hampshire (1 May).
Northamptonshire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 98 runs

At Northampton, Northamptonshire Steelbacks' Bilal Shafayat struck a career-best 74 from 82 balls as Northants stormed to 266 for 9. Shafayat was dropped on 11 and 56, but congratulated by Hampshire captain, Shane Warne, who was taken for 53 in nine overs. Hampshire fell to 44 for 4 in reply and, despite 42 from Shaun Udal batting number eight, were never in the game as the Hawks were all out for 168. Northamptonshire seamer Ben Phillips took his second List A four-wicket-haul, removing Kevin Pietersen, John Crawley, Warne and Chris Tremlett on his way to four for 48. (BBC scorecard)
National League: Hampshire v Gloucestershire (2 May).
Gloucestershire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 60 runs

Jon Lewis won the game for Gloucestershire Gladiators with 40 runs off 28 balls with the bat, and then taking out the Hampshire Hawks top order by taking 5 for 19 with the ball. Lewis had come in as a pinch hitter at number four after Matthew Windows retired hurt. It was the Gladiators won the toss at the Rose Bowl, Southampton and, thanks to Lewis and 63 from Phil Weston, they scored 210 for 9. Hampshire's innings was stopped by Lewis, and despite a 55-run partnership between John Crawley and Nic Pothas, it was never enough, and they finished on 150 all out. (BBC scorecard)

C&G Trophy Round One: Shropshire v Hampshire (4 May).
Hampshire beat Shropshire by 7 wickets to progress to Round Two of the C&G Trophy

Shropshire batted first at Whitchurch, making only 132 as Shane Warne and Richard Logan took 3 wickets each. This was never a big enough target to hold off Hampshire. The crowd were treated to a powerful innings by England's new star one-day performer, Kevin Pietersen, who had been promoted to No. 1 in the batting order. He scored 76 off 49 balls in an innings that included six sixes and seven fours as Hampshire racked up 133 for 3 off 21.1 overs. (Cricinfo scorecard)
County Championship: Hampshire v Middlesex (6-9 May).
Hampshire (19pts) beat Middlesex (5pts) by 64 runs

Hampshire won a closely-fought match at the Rose Bowl by 64 runs despite the efforts with the ball by New Zealand and Middlesex all-rounder Scott Styris, who took his first ten-wicket haul of his career on a pitch that quickly deteriorated and in Styris' own words was "junk". With former England wicket-keeper John Crawley starring in the first innings, making a controlled 84 before being ninth out to Alan Richardson. There were disappointments for England fans, though, who had hoped that Kevin Pietersen would find some form - instead, he was out for a 10-ball duck in the first innings. Hampshire made 275 in their first innings, Alan Richardson and Scott Styris taking four wickets each.

Middlesex' reply would have been a sorry one but for a big partnership between Owais Shah (83) and Irish left-hander Ed Joyce (70), who continued his great form in the Championship, passing 400 runs in his third match of the season. The pair were the only ones who passed 35, but their fourth-wicket partnership of 166 was the highest in the match. However, leg spinner Shane Warne got the better of both of them in the end, as Joyce gave a return catch and Shah was stumped off the bowling of the Australian. With Hampshire losing two quick wickets to be 28 for 2 at the close, the match hung in the balance, with nightwatchman Billy Taylor on 0 and Australian batsman Simon Katich on 1.

Billy Taylor, however, played a special knock. Lasting 116 balls, he scored only 9 runs, but his stamina proved invaluable. He forged good partnerships with Katich and Crawley, giving Hampshire a good platform to hit loose from. Wicketkeeper Nic Pothas was top-scorer with 65, but Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine (30) and Dimitri Mascarenhas (44) also chipped in to lift Hampshire to 304. A spirited reply from Middlesex was always tampered by the Hampshire bowlers chipping away at their line-up patiently, and despite 52 from former Kent batsman Ed Smith, Middlesex were defeated as Chris Tremlett ripped out the tail, ending with four for 59 - just outperformed by Warne, who took four for 58.
(Cricinfo scorecard)

County Championship: Kent v Hampshire (11-14 May).
Kent (10pts) drew with Hampshire (10pts)

Hampshire put on 328 in only 73.3 overs on the first day at Canterbury, helped greatly by a maiden 72-ball first-class century by Shane Warne, who came in with the score on 130 for 7. First class debutant wicket-keeper Tim Burrows scored 42, sharing a 131-run stand with Warne. In reply, Kent were 135 for 3 at stumps, with David Fulton scoring a half-century.

On the second day, Kent were all out for 305, Hampshire making 191 for 2 in reply, putting them firmly in the box seat. The day's honours went to Simon Katich, who was on 125 at close, and with Kevin Pietersen also scoring a century on day three, Hampshire were able to declare on 461 for 9, setting a mammoth target of 485. Kent were 121 for 2 in reply when time was called. 

The fourth and final day saw Kent pull off a draw after they attempted to win. When the eighth wicket fell at 370, the tailenders looked for the draw, which they achieved as Kent reached their highest-ever fourth innings total of 447 for 9. Kent's innings featured 77 from Martin van Jaarsveld as six other batsmen scored more than 35. (Cricinfo scorecard)
National League: Middlesex v Hampshire (15 May).
Hampshire (4pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by 105 runs

Seldom has a captain regretted his decision as much as Ben Hutton of Middlesex Crusaders must have done when he chose to field on a flat Lord's against Hampshire Hawks. Before the match, Middlesex were top of the table, Hampshire rock bottom. It didn't show. Kevin Pietersen played a typical knock, scoring 80 off 50 balls with six sixes, while Dimitri Mascarenhas got himself a 26-ball fifty as Hampshire amassed 353 for 8 off 45 overs - a run rate of 7.84. Despite Owais Shah's 89, Middlesex were never in it, and crumbled to 248 all out in just 39 overs - Pietersen bowling the last over, conceding a single off the first ball before bowling four dot balls to Paul Hutchison and having him caught by captain Shane Warne on the last ball - meaning that Pietersen now had figures of 1-0-1-1 in one-day cricket. It turned out to be his only List A over all season.

C&G Trophy Round Two: Glamorgan v Hampshire (17 May).
Hampshire beat Glamorgan by six wickets to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C & G Trophy

Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine and veteran wicket-keeper Nic Pothas made the most important contributions as Hampshire overpowered Glamorgan at Cardiff. Only Mike Powell showed some sort of resistance, scoring 56 in Glamorgan's 214, while Ervine took five for 50 from his ten overs - admittedly mostly tail-enders, but he got the most wickets. Chris Tremlett also took three for 32. Pothas then notched up the first limited-over century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball. England prospect Kevin Pietersen continued his fine form with 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas. Thanks to the quick scoring of Pothas and Pietersen, Hampshire won with nearly 11 overs to spare.

County Championship: Hampshire v Glamorgan (20-23 May).
Hampshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (3pts) by nine wickets

Amid rains at Southampton, Hampshire batted their way to the big lead they were expected to get against Glamorgan, who had lost four games in the Championship before this. Former England batsman John Crawley crawled his way to a day-long century, while Kevin Pietersen took care of the fast scoring, making a century off 99 balls and ending with 126. Hampshire eventually made 401 for 8 declared to get full batting points before attacking Glamorgan. Chris Tremlett bowled well in the attempt, removing David Hemp, Mike Powell and Jonathan Hughes among others to take four for 42 and reduce Glamorgan to 229 - a score that would have been much lower but for Darren Thomas, who blitzed his way to 63. Following on, Glamorgan batted more casually, getting to 77 for 1 at stumps on day 3, but wickets tumbled in the morning, reducing Glamorgan to 147 for 5. Robert Croft and Mike Powell rebuilt, but when Australian batsman Simon Katich had Croft caught by skipper Shane Warne and Powell went a few overs later, Glamorgan imploded to 250 all out as Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine picked up the last three wickets, finishing with five for 60, while Tremlett took three for 48. In reply, Hampshire brushed aside the target of 79 inside fifteen overs, with Katich - unusually - opening the batting. With Nottinghamshire losing to Kent and Warwickshire and Surrey not playing, Hampshire took the lead in the Championship with their emphatic full-score win.
(Cricinfo scorecard)

County Championship: Warwickshire v Hampshire (25-26 May).
Warwickshire (19pts) beat Hampshire (3pts) by ten wickets 

Defending champions Warwickshire needed a win against table-toppers Hampshire to stay in the title chase, and in a low-scoring match at Stratford-on-Avon they managed it. The Scot Dougie Brown was the pick of the bowlers, taking four for 59 as the visitors crumbled to 184, rescued somewhat by a run-a-ball 34 from off-spinner Shaun Udal who batted at nine. Nick Knight and 22-year-old Ian Westwood, batting in his fourth first-class game, sent Warwickshire to 135 for 0 before losing a couple of wickets before stumps. The second day belonged to Hampshire, however, taking seven wickets - captain Shane Warne with six of them for 88 runs, as they crumbled to 265. 

However, a magnificent spell from Zimbabwean all-rounder Heath Streak, who took four wickets for 11 from nine overs, including five maidens, reduced Hampshire to 34 for 5 before Michael Brown and Sean Ervine rebuilt. However, two quick wickets before tea meant that Hampshire led by six runs with three wickets remaining - a surefire loss, almost. They rebuilt somewhat, but another two wickets from Streak resulted in him finishing with 6 for 31, and Hampshire were bowled out for 124. Nick Knight then smashed 39 not out off 27 balls to see Warwickshire past the 44-run target inside 4.4 overs and a win inside two days.

National League: Hampshire v Northamptonshire (30 May).
Northamptonshire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by four wickets

Hampshire Hawks batted first at The Rose Bowl, and despite an unbeaten 100 from Greg Lamb - the first of his List A career - Hampshire were tied down to 226 for 7 off their 45 overs, mainly thanks to three for 30 from Australian Damien Wright. Six wides from Chris Tremlett, who conceded 51 runs off his eight overs then cost Hampshire the game after Shaun Udal had taken three wickets to set Northamptonshire Steelbacks back to 135 for 5. David Sales added 49 with Wright before Ben Phillips guided Northamptonshire to four points with 26 off 12 balls and secured a win with ten balls to spare.

June.
The first Championship game in June saw them come back to edge a win against Nottinghamshire by 14 runs, and they carried their good one-day form into the match with Lancashire which they won by 79 runs. They then lost heavily to England in a fifty-over game that provided the national side with practice prior to the NatWest Series with Bangladesh and Australia. Their title hopes were dented, however, as they went down by an innings to Surrey, and the Hawks took their rage out on a sorry Glamorgan side that were defeated by seven wickets. 

County Championship: Nottinghamshire v Hampshire (1-4 June).
Hampshire (17pts) beat Nottinghamshire (4pts) by 14 runs

Hampshire pulled off a close win on the final day against their title rivals. There was no play on the first day at Trent Bridge because of rain. When play did get underway, Hampshire batted first, making 277 as Andrew Harris took 6 for 83. Nine Hampshire batsmen made double-figure scores, with only Kevin Pietersen (two-ball 0) and No. 11 Richard Logan dismissed for a one-digit score. More rain meant that Nottinghamshire were only on 222 for 5 in reply by the end of the third day. With both teams eager for the 14 points on offer for an outright victory, terms were agreed to between the two sides. Nottinghamshire declared overnight, and Hampshire replied by hitting  220 for 4 off 28.3 overs. These overs were bowled by Jason Gallian, David Hussey and Darren Bicknell - players who on average bowled a couple of overs a match, but who now bowled as Hampshire were invited to score quickly. Hussey got career best figures of four for 105. Nottinghamshire were set 276 to win, and a century from Stephen Fleming saw the hosts to 227 for 3, but after that they collapsed, losing their last five wickets for three runs, with Chris Tremlett taking 5 for 80, including a hat-trick as Hampshire edged the victory.

National League: Lancashire v Hampshire (5 June).
Hampshire (4pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by 79 runs

Despite an economical bowling performance from England prospect James Anderson who took two for 18 off 7.5 overs, Lancashire Lightning imploded with the bat at home against Hampshire Hawks who moved out of the relegation zone as they took a 79-run win at Old Trafford. Hampshire batted first, and Derek Kenway top-scored with 65 as they were bowled out for 200, but Lancashire could only muster 121 against Hampshire's strong bowling attack, Chris Tremlett taking three for 30 while off-spinner Shaun Udal took three tail-enders for 11.

Warm-up Match: Hampshire v England (11 June).
England beat Hampshire by 153 runs

England warmed-up for the one-day NatWest Series that started on the 16th with an emphatic win in a 50-over game against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl, Southampton. England batted first, and disappointly Geraint Jones failed once again as an opener, leaving after facing two balls for a duck. Marcus Trescothick also fell cheaply. The innings was steaded by Andrew Strauss, who made 85 off 108 balls, and local hero Kevin Pietersen, who made 77 off 80 balls, which included 2 sixes. In reply Hampshire were reduced to 14 for 6, with Darren Gough picking up a hat-trick. Simon Jones also picked up 3 wickets as Hampshire were all out for 85. (Cricinfo scorecard)

Warm-up Match: Hampshire v England (11 June, 12-over match).
England beat Hampshire by one wicket

In a bonus 12-over match, arranged in haste as Hampshire were bowled out for 85 in the first match, Hampshire - led by hired-in Vikram Solanki who made 41 - scored 110 for 4, but were still beaten by a massive smash from Kevin Pietersen for England, as he scored 46 from 15 balls. However, that was not all - Chris Tremlett's three wickets threatened to ruin England's chase, but Simon Jones and Darren Gough saw them to the target on the last ball.

County Championship: Hampshire v Surrey (15-17 June).
Surrey (21pts) beat Hampshire (3pts) by an innings and 55 runs

A great team effort, despite Martin Bicknell being out of form, resulted in Surrey winning their third game of the season and sharing third place in the table with Hampshire. A healthy opening partnership between Scott Newman and Richard Clinton worth 100 was to be the highest of the entire match, and despite Chris Tremlett taking wickets regularly, he also conceded a lot of runs, as he ended with four for 106 off twenty overs. Newman eventually finished with 111 and Australian David Thornely made 73 to see Surrey to a final score of 361 - in just 81.4 overs. The first two days at The Rose Bowl were hampered by rain, but amid the showers, Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh took six for 36 as Hampshire crumbled in a rather unimpressive heap for 146. Only two batsmen passed 20, and seven were out in single figures. Hampshire's second innings began with the first ball of the third day, and James Ormond ripped out two wickets quickly, Mohammad Akram got a five-for, and only John Crawley's 67 - off 62 balls with thirteen boundaries, slightly out of place in the situation - passed 25. Thus, the two teams were tied on 100 points in the Championship, allowing Warwickshire and Kent to run away further on the table.

National League: Hampshire v Glamorgan (19 June).
Hampshire (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by seven wickets

A toothless bowling effort from Glamorgan Dragons became their downfall as Hampshire Hawks recorded a relatively comfortable seven-wicket win at The Rose Bowl. Batting first, Glamorgan were in a good position at 117 for 1, but Shaun Udal and Shane Warne chipped away at the Glamorgan middle-order. Robert Croft, the former England spinner, top-scored with a healthy 88, and an eighth-wicket partnership of 23 rescued Glamorgan to 211 for 7. It was never enough, however, as all Hampshire batsmen - excluding Derek Kenway, who was out for 4 - fired and took runs at will off the bowling. With 45 deliveries and seven wickets remaining, Hampshire eased to victory to increase the gap to the relegation zone.

Twenty20 Cup Group Stage.
Hampshire were without a win for the first two Twenty20 games, losing to Middlesex in a close game before having a match with Sussex rained off, but they won a low-scoring match against Surrey Lions at the Oval. They followed up with a win over Kent and two no-results with Essex, but a loss to Sussex were to be crucial. Despite a win over Middlesex on the last matchday, they were still behind Middlesex on games won, and behind Sussex on head-to-head, thus they finished fourth in the table and did not qualify for the quarter-finals. 

Hampshire v Middlesex (22 June).
Middlesex (2pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 18 runs

Owais Shah made a good attempt at getting the highest strike-rate of the opening day of Twenty20 cricket, recording 72 runs off only 30 balls to lift Middlesex Crusaders to an unassailable 210 for 6. For Hampshire Hawks, Shane Warne showed somewhat poor captaincy when Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine was the eighth man to come on to bowl - and then took two for 13 from two overs. New Zealander Craig McMillan, meanwhile, conceded twenty-eight runs from his only over. Despite Nic Pothas scoring 59 off 39 balls, the Hawks were nowhere near keeping up with the required pace, and Middlesex bowler Irfan Pathan was a main cause of that - he took three for 16 from four overs, as Hampshire finished on 192 for 7.

Surrey v Hampshire (25 June).
Hampshire (2pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by three wickets

James Bruce and Richard Logan, Hampshire Hawks' new-ball bowlers,  reduced Surrey Lions to pieces at the Oval. Only Rikki Clarke passed 12 runs for Surrey, and he did so in style, making 52 with six fours and a six, while Logan and Bruce shared seven wickets btetween them. Hampshire had reason to be happy with bowling Surrey out for 118, although they did concede 17 wides, as extras were the second highest scorer for Surrey. Hampshire then attempted to collapse of their own, crashing to 6 for 2 and 66 for 7, but 34 from off-spinner and captain Shaun Udal saw them home without any further loss of wickets.

Hampshire v Kent (27 June).
Hampshire (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by five wickets

Zimbabwean Greg Lamb, playing for the Hampshire Hawks as a home qualified player due to owning an English passport, took four wickets, including three former Test players, for 28 - which helped peg Kent Spitfires back to 154 for 9. Hampshire's reply was very well timed, and even a good bowling spell from Kent's James Tredwell - who only conceded sixteen runs off the bat in four overs -  could not stop the Hawks. Lawrence Prittipaul made 35 before being out on the penultimate ball with the scores tied, but off-spinner and stand-in captain Shaun Udal, however, made a single on the last ball, as Hampshire reached 155 for 5 in their 20 overs - Nic Pothas top-scoring with 58.

Sussex v Hampshire (1 July).
Sussex (2pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 10 runs

A twelve-over game at Hove was won by Sussex Sharks, though the rain threatened to destroy it all. Ian Ward and Matt Prior opened the batting for Sussex, who had been sent in to bat by Hampshire Hawks' captain Shaun Udal, and they made good use of it, sending Sussex to 53 for 0. Two quick wickets from Sean Ervine slowed the Sharks' progression, as they slumped to 88 for 5, but Michael Yardy hit 10 in four balls in an unbeaten 11-run sixth-wicket stand with Carl Hopkinson. Chasing, Hampshire never quite kept up with the required run rate, as Mushtaq Ahmed took three for 19 in his three overs to be the main cause of the Hawks' demise, and Hampshire finished on 89 for 6.

Middlesex v Hampshire (6 July).
Hampshire (2pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by six wickets

In a high-scoring match at Richmond upon Thames, Middlesex Crusaders made 174 for 7 having opted to bat first. Owais Shah made yet another fifty - his fifth in eight innings - while Scott Styris and Paul Weekes made quick scores to up the run-rate. Shaun Udal, Sean Ervine and Craig McMillan all got two wickets. Hampshire Hawks started slowly, at about seven an over, but McMillan took a liking to Chris Peploe in particular as he smashed five sixes in his half-hour 65 not out, and thanks to McMillan's big hitting Hampshire won with sixteen balls and six wickets to spare. However, it was in vain - with only three wins, they finished fourth in the South Division tables, while Middlesex qualified despite having a poorer net run rate than Hampshire.

July.
Middlesex, however, beat Hampshire rather comfortably in the County Championship the following week, to send Hampshire nearer the relegation mire, and after the loss to Nottinghamshire in the National League it became woefully clear that Hampshire's lack of Pietersen and Warne hurt them. However, they succeeded in digging out a 35-run win over Sussex, who only needed 104 for seven wickets on the fourth day, but were bowled out by Dimitri Mascarenhas and Sean Ervine. Two rained off matches followed, against Bangladesh A and Worcestershire Royals.

County Championship: Middlesex v Hampshire (8-11 July).
Middlesex (19pts) beat Hampshire (7pts) by two wickets

Hampshire won the toss and chose to bat at a Southgate wicket which the final scores suggested to be not as batting-friendly as a month ago, when 13 wickets fell in the Championship match between Middlesex and Glamorgan. Three wickets from Chris Peploe set the visitors back to 189 for 7, but a 79-ball century from Shane Warne - just in time to get some Ashes form - lifted them to 355. The returning Irishman, Ed Joyce, made 54 for Middlesex, and Jamie Dalrymple made 62, but despite those innings - and 37 extras - Middlesex could only scamper 272. 

Hampshire were leading by 104 overnight with one wicket down, but the third day belonged to Dalrymple. The Kenyan-born off-spinner took four for 53, including internationals John Crawley and Craig McMillan, as Hampshire imploded to 192. A Twenty20 style hit-out from Owais Shah, who made 60 off 56 balls, lifted Middlesex to 168 for 4 at stumps, and as the Hampshire captain Warne chose to bowl himself over after over despite being smashed out of the park (ending with 108 runs off nearly 30 overs for only two wickets), Middlesex reached the target shortly before lunch on day four with two wickets to spare, despite losing three wickets to Shaun Udal and two to Zimbabwean part-timer Greg Lamb.

C&G Trophy Quarter-Final: Surrey v Hampshire (15 July).
Hampshire beat Surrey by two wickets to progress to the Semi-Finals of the C&G Trophy

Despite an unbeaten 158 from Jonathan Batty, Surrey still lost their quarter-final game at The Oval, having first batted to make 358 for 6 in 50 overs. James Benning with 73, and Graham Thorpe with 60, also contributed, as Hampshire used seven bowlers who all failed to keep their conceded runs below six an over. In reply, Azhar Mahmood served up a wicket maiden over in the first over of Hampshire's innings, leaving Hampshire 359 to win with nine wickets in hand, but Shane Watson and Craig McMillan put the visitors from the south back on track with a partnership of 81 for the fourth wicket. When McMillan was run out, Hampshire were 200 for 4, but Watson powered on to make 132, his highest career List A cricket score to boost Hampshire to 342 for 8 when Tim Murtagh broke through his defences. By then, it was too late, as Shaun Udal completed his 44 not out, having added 63 with Watson for the eighth wicket earlier, and Hampshire made it to the target with thirteen balls to spare - although they had been gifted eleven extra balls due to no-balls and wides.

National League: Nottinghamshire v Hampshire (17 July).
Nottinghamshire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by one wicket

Captain Stephen Fleming stood tall for Nottinghamshire Outlaws winning them the game as they chased down 241 at Trent Bridge. Hampshire Hawks had batted first, and no Hawk batsman converted their starts, and Gareth Clough's two for 44 threatened to stop their innings prematurely, as they were 152 for 6 when Kevin Latouf gave a return catch to Samit Patel. However, a big seventh-wicket partnership between Dimitri Mascarenhas and Sean Ervine lifted Hampshire to 240 for 8. Mascarenhas and Ervine also grabbed two wickets each in the Nottinghamshire reply, and things looked grim for the hosts when Chris Read departed for 4 with Nottinghamshire still needing 114 runs for the last four wickets. 

However, Fleming and Mark Ealham put the chase back on with a partnership of 75, before Hampshire struck again with wickets in successive overs, and then Shaun Udal had Greg Smith lbw for 6. Needing 15 for the last wicket, Fleming shielded Andrew Harris from strike (Harris faced three balls in a partnership of 19), to end with 102 not out - his sixteenth one-day century - to win the match for Nottinghamshire with an over to spare. Notable also was the 36 extras Hampshire conceded, including six penalty runs.

County Championship: Hampshire v Sussex (20-23 July).
Hampshire (19.5pts) beat Sussex (6pts) by 35 runs

Hampshire's veteran wicketkeeper Nic Pothas made his way to a four-hour 135, his twelfth first-class century, after Jason Lewry, James Kirtley and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan had reduced Hampshire to 102 for 6 in the middle of the afternoon session on the first day. Pothas was well supported by Zimbabwean Sean Ervine, who made 69, and the pair added 191 in three hours before Naved-ul-Hasan broke through with the last ball of the day, having Ervine caught by Ian Ward. Hampshire slumped to 309 on the morning of day two, and solid contributions from the entire batting order - bar number three Michael Yardy who made a duck - lifted Sussex to a slender seven-run lead amid Ervine's swing bowling, which yielded five wickets for 73. However, Mushtaq Ahmed got the early breakthrough for Sussex, and James Kirtley ripped out two quick wickets as Hampshire folded to 22 for 3 overnight.

Kirtley and Naved-ul-Hasan continued to pile on the pressure on the third morning, as they eked out two catches and reduced Hampshire to 28 for 5, a lead of 21. However, once again, the all-rounders fought back. Australian Shane Watson made 82, while Pothas added 74, and number 11 Chris Tremlett made an unbeaten 44 to ensure that Hampshire set a competitive target of 271, despite Kirtley's five for 67. Ian Ward made 60 and Murray Goodwin an unbeaten 51 as Sussex cruised to 167 for 3 after only 38 overs on day three, needing 104 more to win on the fourth day. 

Goodwin added 20 more on the final morning before Dimitri Mascarenhas snared him out, but he had stood tall in Mascarenhas' early spell on the morning of day 4, which had yielded three wickets for two runs. Goodwin was eventually caught by Greg Lamb, but Sussex still needed only 55 for the last three wickets - however, Sean Ervine added the wickets of Pakistanis Rana and Ahmed to his tally to help bowl Sussex out for 235. Thus, Hampshire took the victory in a closely contested game, although they were later deducted half a point for a slow over rate.

August.
August started with a comprehensive 178-run win over a battling Gloucestershire side, which saw Hampshire into second place in the Championship table, but this was followed up with a loss to the same side in the National League. Three days later, however, they avenged that by beating Lancashire, and then Hampshire invited Kent to a top-of-the-table clash. However, this match was drawn, leaving the title battle in Division One wide open. Five days later, the team beat Yorkshire to qualify for the C&G Trophy Final, and the one-day success continued with a four-wicket National League defeat of Worcestershire. Their second Championship draw in a row came against Surrey later on in the week, before they lost to champions Essex Eagles on the last Sunday of August.

County Championship: Gloucestershire v Hampshire (3-6 August).
Hampshire (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (7pts) by 178 runs

Gloucestershire bowlers Steve Kirby, Jon Lewis and Malinga Bandara threatened to make a mockery of Shaun Udal's decision to have a bat at Bristol, as Hampshire fell to 81 for 7, with five batsmen out for single-figures. However, a 257-run partnership - a Hampshire record for the eighth wicket - between Nic Pothas and Andy Bichel turned the match around, as Lewis was carted for 112 runs in his 20 overs, despite five of them being maiden overs. Hampshire finished their innings on 385 all out, after Pothas had made 139 and Bichel 138, and Gloucestershire struggled initially with the bat, losing their first two wickets for 25 runs (admittedly with Kirby filling the role of nightwatchman). 

On the second day, Alex Gidman posted 115 and Steve Adshead 73 to lift Gloucestershire from 191 for 6 to 363. Hampshire then collapsed again, falling to 23 for 3 (including the wicket of nightwatchman Chris Tremlett) before John Crawley and Shane Watson rescued them with a 120-run partnership, as spinners Bandara and Ian Fisher toiled away to little effect. Hampshire eventually declared on 388 for 7, with four of their batsmen passing fifty, which left Gloucestershire 411 to win in a day. That never looked likely, but attritional cricket from Ramnaresh Sarwan and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 156 for 2, and then Gidman came in to add a further 39 for the fourth wicket. However, Shane Watson got a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Gidman, Shaun Udal unleashed a spell of furious off-spin on the tail, taking six for 61, and Gloucestershire were bowled out with an hour to spare.

Gloucestershire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by five wickets

Mark Hardinges took four for 40 to help Gloucestershire Gladiators record a thumping victory over Hampshire Hawks, after tying down and frustrating the opponents' batsmen. Hardinges was the main culprit as Hampshire lost their last nine wickets for exactly 100 runs to post a total of 178, despite Nic Pothas, Sean Ervine and Shane Watson all making at least 40. In reply, William Weston and Matt Windows paired up for 106 runs for the second wicket, and not even Chris Tremlett, who took three for 34, could stop Gloucestershire from reaching the target with more than ten overs to spare.

National League: Hampshire v Lancashire (10 August).
Hampshire (4pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by eight runs

Hampshire Hawks recovered to post a challenging target after early setbacks, caused by two wickets from Lancashire Lightning spinner Andrew Symonds and losing Nic Pothas early through a run out. They struggled to 86 for 4 before Shane Watson put them back on track with an unbeaten 106, helped by Greg Lamb, who made 42. In a match dominated by foreign or foreign-born players, Marcus North and Symonds put on a 94-run partnership to help Lancashire to 155 for 2. However, Australian all-rounder Andy Bichel took three for 34, Dimitri Mascarenhas rounded off his nine overs by taking two wickets with the two last balls, and Lancashire were left to score 23 from 24 balls with a wicket in hand. James Anderson tried, hitting two fours, but with nine required off ten balls he was lbw to Shaun Udal for nine to give Hampshire an eight-run victory.

County Championship: Hampshire v Kent (12-15 August).
Kent (12pts) drew with Hampshire (10pts)

David Stevens and Robert Key both passed 1000 first-class runs for the season as they lifted Kent to a competitive total at The Rose Bowl. Stevens top-scored with 101, while Hampshire's Australian all-rounder Andy Bichel took four for 122 - but was thoroughly smacked about by Min Patel and Amjad Khan on the second morning. The pair added 65 for the final wicket to take Kent to a first-innings total of 446. Sean Ervine hit plenty of boundaries in reply, as Hampshire eased to 82 for 1 before play was stopped due to bad weather.

On day three, however, Kent hit back. In 33 fiery overs before lunch, Amjad Khan and Min Patel both took two wickets, and despite more runs from Ervine - who finished with 74 - Hampshire crumbled to 182 for 7 at lunch. However, Andy Bichel and Nic Pothas added 138 for the eighth wicket, as Hampshire eked out 325, with Bichel top-scoring from number nine with 87 off 90 balls. Kent got a good start to their attempt to get quick runs and put a big target up for Hampshire, as they moved to 140 for 4 just before the close of play, but Shane Watson took two quick wickets and Shaun Udal one, and all of a sudden it was up to Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall to save Kent, as they were 153 for 7 overnight. Kemp fell on the fourth morning, as Kent rolled over for 185, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 307 runs to get in 83 overs. A 95-run partnership between Sean Ervine and John Crawley put Hampshire into a good position at 139 for 1, but Hampshire failed to score quickly enough, and three wickets from Simon Cook could not quite force a victory as Hampshire hung on to finish on 241 for 8 and draw the match.

C&G Trophy Semi-Final: Hampshire v Yorkshire (20 August).
Hampshire beat Yorkshire by eight wickets to progress to the C&G Trophy Final

Yorkshire never managed to score in the semi-final match at The Rose Bowl, which meant that Hampshire were set a relatively easy target of 198 to win. Michael Lumb top-scored with 43, but the late order failed to score runs quickly enough to get past 200; number ten John Blain only made six off 20 deliveries, while number nine Tim Bresnan made three off ten. Yorkshireman Deon Kruis served up some economical bowling early on to John Crawley, and bowled him for a 28-ball 8, but a 147-run partnership between Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine saw Hampshire right on track, as they won with over 10 overs to spare. Ervine made his second List A century, off 96 balls, but was caught and bowled by Richard Dawson three balls later. It didn't matter much - Hampshire only needed 20 runs to win, and Shane Watson and Nic Pothas knocked them off to book Hampshire's place in the C&G Trophy final.

National League: Worcestershire v Hampshire (22 August).
Hampshire (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by four wickets

Hampshire Hawks got the four points from a closely fought match at New Road. Worcestershire Royals had won the toss and chosen to bat, and their innings was shortened to 34 overs out of a scheduled 45 due to rain. Wickets fell regularly, four batsmen being dismissed with scores in the thirties, and the final score of 185 for 7 did not look too threatening. John Crawley and Shane Watson put Hampshire back on track after two early wickets from Kabir Ali shook them, but an economical spell from Ray Price which yielded two wickets was nearly enough. However, the other spinner Gareth Batty was not nearly as economical, and Greg Lamb took him for runs to end with 16 not out and win the game for Hampshire.
County Championship: Surrey v Hampshire (24-27 August).
Hampshire (11pts) drew with Surrey (10pts)

The first day was rained off, and in only three days of cricket, neither team seemed intent on forcing a result, as the run rate was limited to 3.5 runs an over. On the second day, as the first day of actual play, 406 runs were scored for the loss of twelve wickets. Surrey batted first, and after losing Richard Clinton and Mark Ramprakash early, Scott Newman lashed out in a 65-ball cameo. He hit fifteen fours in his 71 before finally being bowled by Dimitri Mascarenhas. Indeed, the second day was a day of boundaries - a total of 270 runs were hit in boundaries, most of them by Mark Butcher (14 fours in 75) and Jonathan Batty (20 fours in 124). Surrey were eventually all out for 378, Shaun Udal wrapping up the tail with the three last wickets falling in four balls. Mohammad Akram then had both openers caught behind as Hampshire closed on 28 for 2, but Surrey toiled for little reward on the third day, Nic Pothas making an unbeaten century as Hampshire declared on 361 for 6, 17 behind Surrey. Thus, the teams were left with a day to play out their second innings, and on the final day, Udal took five for 65 with his off breaks, but Surrey easily saved the draw by making 302, as captain Butcher did not attempt to risk the four points for a draw with a declaration.

National League: Essex v Hampshire (28 August).
Essex (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 12 runs

Economical bowling from Andre Nel and Danish Kaneria gave Essex Eagles the victory over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, and the four points for the win increased their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title. Essex opener William Jefferson kept his calm while the rest of the top order deserted him, making 88, but when three wickets fell for only three runs and the score was 172 for 7 Hampshire would have fancied their chances of bowling Essex out. Only two more wickets fell, though, as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 at the end of their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria kept his calm, only allowing 26 runs off his nine overs, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory - they could put some of the blame on their overseas players, as Australians Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributed only four runs off 18 deliveries.

September.
A three-day win over Warwickshire saw them enjoy one day at the top of the Championship, before they were overtaken by Nottinghamshire. On 3 September, however, they won the C&G Trophy with an 18-run win over Warwickshire, meaning that they were the only club with a chance of winning two titles in 2005. Their one-day form didn't carry into the League, however, as they lost by two wickets to Middlesex, moving closer to relegation, and that trend continued with a 151-run defeat to Glamorgan. However, they recovered to beat Glamorgan in the Championship, and ended the Championship season with a thumping innings-and-188 run victory over the county champions Nottinghamshire, to finish second, 2.5 points behind. Hampshire then lost their final game of the season, to just Nottinghamshire, which led to their relegation into Division Two of the National League.

County Championship: Hampshire v Warwickshire (30 August-1 September).
Hampshire (22pts) beat Warwickshire (4pts) by an innings and 86 runs

Hampshire dominated proceedings against Warwickshire at The Rose Bowl, occupying the crease for a day and a half to amass 576 runs in their first innings. The top three of James Adams, Sean Ervine and John Crawley set the tone with fifties, and when Crawley departed for 60 the score had moved to 279 for 3. Jonathan Trott and Makhaya Ntini shared three wickets before the end of the day, leaving Hampshire 353 for 6 overnight, but Shane Watson and Dimitri Mascarenhas shared a mammoth 234-run partnership for the seventh wicket. Watson hit a career-best 203 not out, while Mascarenhas took three hours for an unbeaten 102, the first century of his season, before Shaun Udal declared. Warwickshire stumbled early on, falling to 21 for 2, but an unbeaten 97 from Nick Knight lifted them to 145 for 4 at the close of play on day two. 

Knight could not save Warwickshire alone, though, and Warwickshire lost sixteen wickets on the third day to crumble to an innings defeat. Knight got his century, ending with 116, but no other batsman passed 30, as they were all out for 258 in the first innings. They were asked to follow on 318 behind, and did rather well initially, getting the score to 110 for 1 after two hours. Then, Jonathan Trott and Ian Westwood fell in quick succession, leaving Jamie Troughton to try and tie together a match-saving innings with the lower order. He made a two-hour 76 before being ninth out, caught off Shaun Udal's bowling, ending Warwickshire's resistance. No further runs were added for the tenth wicket, as Makhaya Ntini was bowled by Udal, and Warwickshire ended on 232 all out - 86 runs short of making Hampshire bat again.  Hampshire captain Udal finished with a second innings analysis of 22-8-44-6, after only one wicket in the first innings. The win left Hampshire briefly on top of the Championship, before Nottinghamshire took over the following day.

C&G Trophy Final: Hampshire v Warwickshire (3 September).
Hampshire won by 18 runs and won the C&G Trophy

Hampshire became the third team to win a major county trophy in 2005, as they prevailed in a high-scoring final at Lord's, leaving only the County Championship left for grabs. Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine added 136 runs for the second wicket to propel Hampshire to a big total against Warwickshire, whose bowlers gave away 20 runs from wides but still managed to bowl Hampshire out on the last ball. Ervine was fifth out, taking 91 balls for his second successive C&G century, before he was caught off Jonathan Trott, who finished with three wickets for 35 runs. Neil Carter took five wickets to redeem his 66 conceded runs, while Makhaya Ntini bowled two maiden overs for Warwickshire, but went wicketless.

Warwickshire were set to chase 291 to win, and Carter fulfilled his job as a pinch hitter well, scoring four fours and one six en route to 32, and Nick Knight and Ian Bell kept up with the required run rate well. However, Bell suffered cramps just before he reached 50, and that limited his movements - he succumbed shortly afterwards, chipping a simple catch to Chris Tremlett and was gone for 54. The other batsmen tried to add runs with Knight, but yielded to the Hampshire bowling and fielding effort, and when Knight was finally dismissed for 118 Warwickshire needed 40 runs for the last three wickets. Shane Watson effectively stopped that, having Dougie Brown and Ashley Giles out bowled, leaving Warwickshire to hit about 20 runs in the last over. It was too much for Makhaya Ntini, who was bowled by Chris Tremlett with the second ball of the last over, and thus Hampshire took an 18-run victory.

National League: Hampshire v Middlesex (5 September).
Middlesex (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by two wickets

Two days after their win in the C&G Trophy Final, Hampshire Hawks were defeated by Middlesex Crusaders, to move closer to relegation in the National League. They were put in to bat, and lost wicket-keeper Nic Pothas for 5 early on, but John Crawley and Sean Ervine fought back with a 101-run partnership for the second wicket. The Middlesex bowlers frequently interrupted with wickets, though, and Crawley failed to hit the ball hard enough to end with only six fours in his 122-ball 92. Hampshire closed on 227 for 6, with five Middlesex bowler. Middlesex lost Paul Weekes in the first over, but a blistering 139-run stand between Owais Shah and Jamie Dalrymple turned the match around. Despite three wickets each from Hampshire's Chris Tremlett and Greg Lamb, Middlesex' Chris Peploe held his head calm, and with 14 not out he guided Middlesex to a two-wicket victory with 11 balls to spare.

National League: Glamorgan v Hampshire (13 September).
Glamorgan (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 151 runs

Glamorgan Dragons recorded a victory at their home ground Sophia Gardens, despite being tied down in mid-match by Sean Ervine and Shaun Udal who took two wickets each and both conceded less than 40 runs. Wicket-keeper Mark Wallace hit one six and one four in a valuable hit-out late on, while Mike Powell had set the pace with 52. Then, Hampshire Hawks were shot down in the chase. David Harrison had John Crawley caught with the second ball of the match, and Andrew Davies followed up, getting Greg Lamb and Ervine caught behind. With James Adams bowled by Harrison, Hampshire had scored seven runs for four wickets, and their lower order never recovered. Jono McLean was the first to hit into double figures, before he too was caught behind off Davies, and Harrison then took two as Hampshire were 33 for 7. Kevin Latouf and Shaun Udal adjusted somewhat, adding 19 for the eighth wicket, but first change bowler Alex Wharf cleaned up them as well, leaving Hampshire all out for 69 - the lowest score of the National League Division One all season, and giving Glamorgan the highest victory by runs in the division all season.

County Championship: Glamorgan v Hampshire (15-18 September).
Hampshire (21pts) beat Glamorgan (4pts) by 75 runs

The first day of this match was rained off, and so Glamorgan's last match of the season was effectively reduced to a three-day one. They still managed to lose, however, capping their Championship season with their fourteenth loss in sixteen matches to cement their last place in the table. When the match got underway, the entire Hampshire batting order made contributions, and an innings including half-centuries from James Adams, Jono McLean, Simon Katich and Dimitri Mascarenhas, saw them to a total of 350. Australia leg spinner Shane Warne hit three sixes in a 17-minute 24, while Glamorgan captain Robert Croft snared five wickets for 103 runs. 

The returning Shane Warne, fresh from taking 40 wickets in the 2005 Ashes, took four for 50 in Glamorgan's innings, as Glamorgan faltered from 151 for 4 to 249 all out, and the third day's play ended with Simon Katich and Sean Ervine plundering runs in return. An opening stand of 117 was achieved quickly, and Warne then clobbered two sixes in a nine-ball 15, as Hampshire added 218 for 7 in just 32 overs before declaring. Croft completed another five-wicket-haul, but still conceded 57 in ten overs. Set 320 to win, Glamorgan went about it positively, as Croft led from the front with a well-paced 90. Once he was caught behind off Sean Ervine, however, Glamorgan needed 94 for the last three wickets, and the lower order succumbed to the Zimbabwean Ervine. Wicket-keeper and number eight Mark Wallace was left not out on 33, as Glamorgan posted a total of 244, while Ervine finished with five for 60 in the second innings, his best bowling figures of the season thus far.

County Championship: Hampshire v Nottinghamshire (21-23 September).
Hampshire (22pts) beat Nottinghamshire (2pts) by an innings and 188 runs

Hampshire were put in to bat by Nottinghamshire, who had won the Championship four days earlier. However, Hampshire's batsmen all put in above 50 scores after Sean Ervine was bowled for 9, James Adams, John Crawley, Simon Katich and Nic Pothas all exceeded 50, and Crawley went on to make 150 not out at the end of the first day - his highest score of the season. Boosted by 75 extras - 38 coming in no-balls, of which 18 were conceded by Mark Footitt alone - Hampshire ended their innings voluntarily on 714 for 5 - a team record - having hit 290 runs for one wicket in 42.3 second-day overs. Captain Shane Warne declared when Mascarenhas got his century, only to later discover that Crawley - who had gone from 200 to 300 with 58 balls - had been denied of the Hampshire highest innings score by five runs, despite a career-best 311 not out . Dick Moore's record from 1937 thus remained. When Hampshire bowled, spinner Shaun Udal celebrated his England call-up with four wickets for 39 runs, while Mascarenhas continued with his all-round effort, taking his second five-wicket-haul of the season as Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 213 shortly before the close on day two. Warne chose to bowl eight balls, conceding six runs. Stephen Fleming top scored for the visitors with 42, as they were asked to follow on - 501 runs behind Hampshire. 

Nottinghamshire needed 269 to avoid suffering the highest defeat of the Championship season, and amid the rain breaks at the Rose Bowl, they passed that score with one wicket in hand, thanks to 97 from Darren Bicknell and a 49-ball cameo from Chris Read which yielded 63 runs. Captain Stephen Fleming lasted four minutes at the crease, hitting three fours, a single and a dot ball before he was caught by James Adams off Warne. Udal took another four-wicket-haul, but conceded 70 in 11.5 overs, and even Warne was expensive, conceding 67 in thirteen overs. Nottinghamshire were eventually bowled out for 313, but Hampshire finished 2.5 points behind Nottinghamshire in the Championship - despite the same win-loss record and two victories in their head-to-head matches.

National League: Hampshire v Nottinghamshire (25 September).
Nottinghamshire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 37 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method

Hampshire Hawks were defeated by Nottinghamshire, in particular David Hussey and Ryan Sidebottom, to go down into Division Two in front of their home crowd. The visiting Nottinghamshire Outlaws batted first, and after a slow start where Anurag Singh and Stephen Fleming had accumulated forties to see them to 101 for 3, Hussey hit loose. He hit five sixes in a 53-ball 75 which, together with 26 off 13 balls from Mark Ealham, took Nottinghamshire to 248 for 5. Then rain intervened, cutting 25 overs off the Hampshire effort. When they came back to bat, Hampshire were set 165 to win - and duly lost six wickets for 58 runs, Gareth Clough having two men bowled and captain Shane Warne lbw. Jono McLean hit 36 from number eight, but Hampshire were still taken out for 127 a ball before the end - Ryan Sidebottom finishing them off by having Billy Taylor caught for 0. Sidebottom thus finished with three for 13 from 23 balls.

The Young Party (Turkish: Genç Parti) is a nationalist, protectionist political party in Turkey. In the last legislative elections on 3 November 2002, the party won 7.2% of the popular vote and no seats.

It must be considered as a big success for a political party to gain such vote when considered that it was their first election. 

At first, it was seen as the only major threat to Ak Parti on the right with its leader Cem Uzan being the owner of Star TV and Star newspaper, but invesigations into the businesses of the Uzan family have largely discredited the party and it does not seem likely that they will recover.

Cem Uzan used his newspaper and TV station to the best of his ability to promote his party, why he has been labelled a Turkish version of Silvio Berlusconi. When he was under investigation, he used advertising space between the first and second halves of champions league football games to launch political assaults upon his opponents.

As a result of Cem Uzan and a few person like Former Parliament Adil Asirim, former Parliament Gonul Alphan and some new faces like Av.Kaan Aytug and Umur Yumuturug being the only recognisable members of the party, it is difficult to see it survive much longer.

Spinal stenosis is a medical condition where the spinal canal narrows and compresses the spinal cord and nerves.  This is usually due to the natural process of spinal degeneration that occurs with aging.  It can also sometimes be caused by spinal disc herniation, osteoporosis, or a tumour.
Spinal stenosis may affect the cervical spine, the lumbar spine or both.  Lumbar spinal stenosis results in low back pain as well as pain or abnormal sensations in the legs.

Cervical spinal stenosis.
The main causes of cervical spinal stenosis (CSS) include cervical spondylosis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), or calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

CSS is more common in males than females, and is mainly found in the 40-60 year age group.

Signs of CSS include spastic gait; upper extremity numbness; upper extremity, lower extremity weakness or both; radicular pain in the upper limb; sphincter disturbances; muscle wasting; sensory deficits; and reflex abnormalities in reflexes.

The best diagnostic and investigative tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while computed tomograghy (CT) is not useful.

If the problem is mild, treatment may be as simple as physical therapy and the use of a cervical collar. If severe, treatments include laminectomy or decompression.

Lumbar spinal stenosis.
The main causes of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) include hypertrophy of the facet joints; spondylolisthesis; diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH); and degenerative disc disease.
Usually, this condition occurs after the age of 50, and both genders are equally affected.

Signs of LSS include neurogenic intermittent claudication that causes leg pain, weakness, and loss of deep tendon reflexes.  With lumbar spinal stenosis, the patient's pain usually is worse while walking and will feel better after sitting down. The patient is usually more comfortable while leaning forward or walking with a shopping cart. 

As with CSS, MRI is the best imaging procedure, though unlike with CSS, CT may be somewhat useful, and can be used if MRI is unavailable.

Treatment includes weight loss, and activity modification, such as using a walker to promote a certain posture.  Epidural steroid injections may also help relieve the leg pain. If the symptoms are more severe, a laminectomy or foraminotomy may be indicated. A new procedure, Interspinous Process Decompression (IPD) has recently been approved by the FDA in November of 2005.  This procedure promises a less invasive way to treat LSS and maintains motion at the affected level. 

Recent developments include the X-Stop and the Walis implant - designed for extra-canalicular treatment of spinal stenosis . Titanium implants act to prevent extension of the stenotic segments and create slight flexion over the segment.

Bourgeois pseudoscience (                   ) was a term of condemnation in the Soviet Union for certain scientific disciplines that were deemed unacceptable from an ideological point of view. 

At various times pronounced "bourgeois pseudosciences" were: genetics (see Lysenkoism), cybernetics, sociology, semiotics, and comparative linguistics (see Japhetic theory). This attitude was most prevalent during the rule of Joseph Stalin.

Other disciplines were declared "bourgeois pseudosciences" in the People's Republic of China.

High-Five Challenge, which airs on Oregon Public Broadcasting and in Washington and is taped in Portland, Oregon is a high school quiz competition featuring teams from Oregon and Washington. It has been on the air since 1993 and was created and is hosted by Wayne Faligowski.

Questions come from 10 different categories, both academic (e.g. Science, History, Georgraphy) and non-academic. Each school appears once during the season. Playoffs are held between  the top eight scoring teams and two random picks. . Each week, two teams of 5 to 7 players (although only 5 may be actively playing at one time, one of these a "Wild Card," ) face questions posed by the host. Once the regular season is completed, the top eight highest-scoring teams advance to the playoffs.

Host.
 Wayne Faligowski;

Announcers.
 Rich Fields (1993-1999);
 Don George (1995-2002);
 Michael Bailey (2002-Present);

Gameplay.
Each team is spotted 2,000 points to start the game. The host checks the five categories for the first half, and one is chosen at random. The host then asks five questions in that category. Each question is worth a pre-stated number of points; within a category, two questions are worth 10 points each, two are worth 20 each, and one is worth 40. All questions are "toss-ups" (that is, players must buzz in to answer); a correct answer earns the points for that question, while wrong answers cost the same amount.

One of the players on each team is designated the "wild card." The wild card player may buzz in just like any other player, except that a wild card's signal takes precedence over any other signal except the other wild card (as such, this is termed a "steal"), and that wild card may confer briefly with his or her teammates before answering. Each wild card can only steal three times during the course of the half, and a failed steal attempt causes a loss of twice the point value of the question.

The categories are played in a random order, and after all five categories are played, the half is over. Substitutions may be made at halftime, and the wild card is always changed.

The second half is played the same as the first half, except that there is an added "mystery category," represented by a line of question marks. The mystery category is always the last category played, and the point values for the mystery category are doubled (to two 20-point questions, two 40-pointers, and one 80-pointer). After the mystery category is played out, the team with the highest score wins the game.

Generally speaking, all players receive calculators, movie rentals, and a free dinner buffet. Teams who advance to the playoffs (the top eight highest-scoring teams, win or lose) are treated to a riverboat cruise, and the final winners receive $3,000 for their school.

 Notes .

 Whenever the three-second time limit for answering expires and the buzzer sounds, Wayne will sometimes call it a "zap," especially when it is the first time that happens in the show, after a string of several correct answers;

 National version .

There have been proposals to take High-Five Challenge national on PBS.

<doc id="2184033" title="Carlos Mencia" nonfiltered="801" processed="793" dbindex="450810">

Ned Arnel Mencía (born October 22, 1967), better known by his stage name Carlos Mencia, is an American comedian, writer, and actor. He is currently the host of his own show on Comedy Central, Mind of Mencia. 

Biography.
Mencia was born  Ned Arnel Mencía , the seventeenth of eighteen children in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  His father, Roberto Holness, is from Honduras, and his mother, Magdelena Mencia, is from Mexico. He was raised in East Los Angeles, California by his aunt Consuelo and uncle Pablo Mencia. By his own admission, staying out of trouble was difficult growing up, but with the help of his family he excelled in school and stayed out of gangs. He majored in electrical engineering at California State University, Los Angeles, but left early to pursue a career in comedy after a successful performance at open mic night at The Laugh Factory. He also has an older brother named Joseph Mencia who is the co-host of Mind of Mencia.

Career.
Mencia was a quick success at such venerated LA stand-up venues as The Comedy Store and The L.A. Cabaret. This led to appearances on The Arsenio Hall Show and Buscando Estrellas, where he attained the title  International Comedy Grand Champion.  Then, in 1994, Mencia was chosen to host HBO's latino comedy showcase Loco Slam.

Mencia followed up Loco Slam by hosting Funny is Funny! on Galavision in 1998. He would continue to do stand-up, including a very successful tour in 2001 with Freddy Soto and Pablo Francisco,  The Three Amigos.  Mencia also did two half-hour specials on HBO, the second of which won him a CableACE Award for Best Stand-Up Comedy Special. After the release of his first comedy album by Warner Records, Take A Joke America, Mencia performed his break-out performance on Comedy Central Presents in 2002. 

By the time his career began to take off in the early 2000s, Mencia was also working as an actor doing guest appearances in the television shows Moesha and The Shield, and starring in the film Outta Time and the animated show The Proud Family.

At the end of 2004, Comedy Central began talks with Carlos Mencia for his own program, shortly after their renewal of comedian Dave Chappelle's contract for Chappelle's Show.  In March of 2005, prior to Chappelle s April 28, 2005 departure from the production of Chappelle s Show and subsequent trip to Africa, Comedy Central announced Mencia's own half-hour comedy show, Mind of Mencia. The show mixed Mencia's stand up comedy with sketch comedy, the same basis for the highly popular Chappelle's Show. The show achieved moderate success in its first season and was brought back for a second season in the spring of 2006, becoming Comedy Central s second highest rated program, and again for a third season that summer.

Mencia is a frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show on XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio. He will be taking part in Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.

During the Superbowl of 2007, Mencia starred in a commerical for Bud Light which was the #1 most replayed commercial according to Tivo.<>

Comedy.


Like many comedians, he focuses on race, sexual orientation, politics, religion, class and society, but in a style which intentionally violates rules of what is politically correct by, for example, making a point to use racial epithets or terms such as  retarded  rather than  disabled  or  mentally handicapped  and otherwise going out of his way to offend liberal sensibilities, such as by advocating capital punishment and sustaining a generally high level of raunchiness in his material.  A staple of his material is diatribes denouncing the actions of people he considers to be stupid, often using his trademark  DEE-Dee-dee!.  He has stated that the phrase doesn t refer to people  who were born retarded,  but rather people  who were born, and are now retarded.  He often advocates Social Darwinism  survival of the fittest  type solutions to this perceived problem of too much stupidity. Some consider his jokes to be intentionally provocative and racist, focusing on stereotypes for the sake of publicity or easy laughs. Mencia, however, says he does not focus on any one race, but that he creates comedy about all races, ethnicities and religions equally, without the desire to have his words taken too seriously. He has the opinion that life should be filled with comedy, as shown by his catchphrase "If you ain't laughin', you ain't livin'".

Criticism.
In a 2005 interview with Howard Stern, comedian George Lopez claimed that he and Mencia were involved in a physical altercation at a comedy club. Lopez alleged that Mencia appropriated thirteen minutes of Lopez's material, without permission, for Mencia's HBO comedy special. Lopez told Stern,  It's not really a feud, I mean, I think I won.  Shortly afterwards, comedian Joe Rogan wrote a post on his website publicly accusing Mencia of being a plagiarist, alleging that Mencia stole jokes from a number of comedians.  

Mencia responded to the accusations while being interviewed on the Tucson, Arizona The Frank Show, stating that Joe Rogan had fabricated the plagiarism charge out of jealousy. On his own website, Mencia argued that the material in question was too generic to be attributed to any single comedian.

Maxim magazine recently named Mencia as the 12th-worst comedian of all time, although television viewers themselves had voted him into 2nd place of the Top 25 stand-up comics in Comedy Central's 2006 "Stand Up Showdown". However, when the results of the 2007 "Stand Up Showdown" were released, Mencia had slumped to 14th place.

The two songs have the same music but different lyrics. There was no new video made for "A Brighter Day"; this was likely due the fact that there was a video for "Andithesis."

Chart performance.
The single was Helena's lowest chart position in Sweden to date. This may of been due to the fact there was no music video filmed for the single. Also in Greece, Helena was releasing her new single "Mambo!" and did not have any time to promote the song in Sweden.

Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, is a fictional city-state in the world of the Forgotten Realms, a Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting. It is located in the Upper Northdark, about two miles below the Surbrin Vale, between the Moonwood and the Frost Hills. It is famed as the birthplace of Drizzt Do'Urden.

Menzoberranzan had its own PC game and was also a boxed gaming supplement for AD&D, with three books.

The city has 32,000 inhabitants one-third drow and the rest humanoid slaves. The city trades poisons, tasty mushrooms, riding lizards, spell scrolls, wine, and water. The worship of Lolth is prevalent, and the city has the clerical academy Arach-Tinilith, a spidershaped building where priestesses are trained. One of the branches of the city's triune academies of Tier Brieche, Arach-Tinilith is neighboured by the warrior school Melee Magthere, and Sorcere tower where arcane spellcasters are sent to study. These academies are the quarters of some of the most powerful spellcasters, clerics, and fighters respectively, and the title of master of an academy is coveted, since being the master of Sorcere or Melee Magthere is as high as the power ladder goes for some houseless drow or even noble males.

Menzoberranzan was founded by a priestess of Lolth named Menzoberra the Kinless. It is ruled by a council of matrons from the eight greatest noble houses; the most powerful House in the city is House Baenre, until recently led by Matron Yvonnel Baenre a drow cleric who was the single most powerful political figure in Menzoberranzan for a few hundred years. She has been succeeded by her daughter Triel. A separate council of mages deals with affairs of the arcane but as its members are all male, it is wholly within the grip of the matrons.

 History .
Menzoberra the Kinless, a powerful priestess of Lolth, founded the city that bears her name in  3917 DR. By the wishes of Lady Lolth, she led seven drow families into the Northdark from the southerly drow holdings of Great Bhaerynden. The drow families, having no immediate external enemy, fell to attacking and undermining one another, as was drow nature, to the greater glory of their evil goddess, who so loved chaos. Only fifty years after the city's founding, in  3864 DR, a great and terrible battle between the two most powerful Houses, House Nasadra and House S'sril, occurred. This battle led to the exile of House Nasadra (which later founded the city of Ched Nasad, and was the First House until the city's recent destruction) and to the rise of House Baenre as the First House of Menzoberranzan.

The city's internal machinations have continued unabated for millennia. The Houses that grow weak are destroyed, and newer Houses rise up to find Lolth's favor. The full history of each House would constitute a nearly endless logbook of treachery, spite, and unceasing ambition. Within the last century, this pattern seems to have accelerated. House Do'Urden ascended from the Tenth House to the Ninth House by destroying the Fourth House, House DeVir. It then ascended to the Eighth House with the much-needed help of Jarlaxle's mercenary band Bregan D'aerthe by destroying the Fifth House, House Hun'ett. House Do'Urden lost the favor of Lolth, however, when Matron Malice Do'Urden turned Zaknafein into a spirit-wraith by using Lolth's dread Zin-Carla ritual and failed to kill Drizzt Do'Urden with him. This resulted in House Baenre utterly destroying House Do'Urden. 

In 1359 DR, during the Time of Troubles, House Oblodra, the Third House, aspired to be the First House of Menzoberranzan. Menzoberranzan was caught in a magic-dead zone, so magic currently did not work there. House Oblodra, however, was gifted in the rare art of psionics and seized upon this opportunity to strike at the other Houses. The matron of House Oblodra nearly reached her goal, but an avatar of Lolth answered Matron Baenre's pleas for help and came to Menzoberranzan after the Time of Troubles had ended. (The drow thought that she herself had restored all magic, but that is not true.) Although she loved chaos, she did not wish to see a House that did not whisper prayer to her to rule the city. Forseeing her temporary loss of power due to the Time of Troubles, Lolth had asked the demon Errtu to protect her worshippers, should she herself fail to do it. In return, Lolth relinquished the hundred-year ban from the Material Plane that had been placed on Errtu when Drizzt Do'Urden had killed him and gave Wulfgar over to Errtu as a prisoner. She then opened a portal for Errtu and his host of demons to lay siege to House Oblodra. By the time the Time of Troubles had passed, Lolth was restored to full power and single-handedly crushed House Oblodra, the remains of their stronghold being pushed into a deep chasm known as the Clawrift, and Matron Oblodra's spirit went to Errtu for eternal torment. Thus the ranks of the ruling Houses changed once again. All this she said was done for her greatest high priestess (although it was really done for herself), the two thousand-year-old Matron Baenre. All Houses in the city witnessed this great miracle and knew that House Baenre was the most favored House of the goddess.

<doc id="1006085" title="Siege of Haarlem" nonfiltered="805" processed="797" dbindex="450814">


In the Eighty Years' War the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands was put under a bloody siege by a Spanish army that wanted to reclaim the revolted city for Philip II, the Spanish king.

Pretext.
The city of Haarlem had a moderate view in the religious war that was going on in the Netherlands at that time. The city managed to escape from the Reformed iconoclasm in 1566 that affected other cities in the Netherlands. When the city of Brielle was conquered by the Geuzen revolutionary army on April 1, the Haarlem municipality did not immediately start supporting the Geuzen. Initially, most city administrators -- unlike many citizens -- did not favor open revolution against Philip II of Spain, who had inherited rule of the Netherlands from his father, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. However, after much political debate the city officially turned against Philip II on July 4, 1572.

The ruler of Spain was not pleased, and sent an army up north under command of Don Fadrique (Don Frederick in Dutch), son of the Duke of Alva. On November 17, 1572 all citizens of the city of Zutphen were murdered by the Spanish army, and on December 1 the city of Naarden suffered the same fate. 

From Amsterdam, still a pro-Spain city, the message came that perhaps negotiations with Don Fadrique were possible. The city administration sent a deputation of 4 people to Amsterdam. The cities defenses were commanded by city-gouvernor Wigbolt Ripperda, a commandor put in charge by the William the Silent, the Prince of Orange. He strongly disapproved of negotiating with the Spanish army, and called the city guard together in De Doelen, and convinced them to stay loyal to the Prince of Orange. The city's administration was replaced with pro-Orange members. 

When the deputation came back from Amsterdam, they were convicted as traitors and sent to the Prince. The Sint-Bavokerk (Saint Bavo Church) was cleared of Roman Catholic symbols the same day.

Under siege.
On December 11, 1572 the Spanish army put Haarlem under siege. The city was not very strong, military speaking. Although the city was completely surrounded by citywalls, they were not in a very good shape. The area around the city could not be inundated, and offered the enemy a lot of places the set up a camp. However, the existence of the Haarlemmermeer (a great lake) nearby, made it difficult for the enemy to cut off the transportation of food into the city completely. 

In the early days of the battle, the Spanish army tried an assault of the city walls, but this attempt to quickly conquer the city failed due to the insufficient preparation by the Spanish army, which had not expected much resistance. This initial victory gave the defenders' morale a big boost.

In the Middle Ages it was not usual to fight in the winter, but the city of Haarlem was crucial and Don Fadrique stayed and put the town under siege. The first two months of the siege the situation was in balance. The Spanish army was digging tunnels, to reach the city walls and blow them up. The defenders made tunnels to blow up the Spanish tunnels. The situation became worse for Haarlem on March 29, 1573. The Amsterdam army, faithful to the Spanish king, occupied the Haarlemmermeer and effectively blocked Haarlem from the outside world. The hunger in the city grew, and the situation became so tense that on May 27 many (Spanish-loyal) prisoners were taken from the prison and murdered. 

On December 19 no less than 625 shots were fired at the defensive wall between the Janspoort to the Catherijnebridge. This forced the defenders to put up a completely new wall. 

Two city gates, the Kruispoort and the Janspoort collapsed from the fighting. 

Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer, a very strong woman, helped defending the city. 

In the beginning of July William I of Orange put together an army of 5000 soldiers near Leiden, to rescue Haarlem. However, the Spanish trapped them at the Manpad and defeated the army.

Surrender.
After seven months the city surrendered on July 13, 1573. Usually, after such a siege, there would be a period of time that the soldiers of the victoring army could pillage the city, but the citizens were allowed to buy themselves and the city free for 240,000 guilders. 

Many soldiers of the army that defended the city were slaughtered; many of them were drowned in the Spaarne river. Gouvernor Ripperda and his lieutenant were beheaded.  Don Fadrique thanked God for his victory in the Sint-Bavokerk. The city would have to host a Spanish garrison.

Although ultimately the city could not be kept for the Prince of Orange, the siege showed other cities that the Spanish army was not invincible. This idea, and the great losses suffered by the Spanish army, helped the cities of Leiden and Alkmaar in their sieges. The latter city would later defeat the Spanish army, a major breakthrough in the Dutch Revolt. In the Sint-Bavo church the following words can still be read:

 In dees grote nood, in ons uutereste ellent
 Gaven wij de stadt op door hongers verbant
 Niet dat hij se in creegh met stormender hant.

 In this hour of need, in ultimate despair, 
 we gave up the city, forced by hunger,
 but not that he easily got it, walking over.

<doc id="3309501" title="History of the Northern Territory" nonfiltered="807" processed="799" dbindex="450816">

The history of the Northern Territory began over 40,000 years ago when Indigenous Australians settled the region. Makassan traders began trading with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory for trepang from at least the 18th century onwards , and possibly for 300 years prior to that, while the coast of the Territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first to attempt to settle the coastal regions of the Territory in the 19th century; however no attempt was successful until the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin in 1869.

Prehistory.

Although sparse, the archeological record of the Northern Territory provides evidence of settlement around 40,000 years ago (at Malakunanja and Nauwalabila, although there is controversy surrounding the thermoluminescent dating of these sites). During this period, sea levels were 100 - 150m lower than at present, and Australia and New Guinea along with large tracts of what is now the Timor Sea formed one single landmass. 

Abundant and complex rock art testifies to the rich cultural and spiritual lives of the original inhabitants of the Northern Territory, and in many areas of the Northern Territory there is a cultural continuum between the earliest inhabitants and the indigenous population today. Rock Art is extremely difficult to date with any reliability, and it can also be difficult to identify a linear sequence of art due to the reworking and reinterpretation of older art by younger generations, however archeologists have been able to identify three distinct phases of art: pre-estaurine (dry climate and extinct animals), estaurine (rising sea levels and marine fauna) and freshwater (freshwater fauna, moving into 'historical' subjects such as makassan traders, and european technology eg guns). Rock art also demonstrates cultural and technological changes, for instance boomerangs give way to broad spearthrowers which give way to long spearthrowers, which give way to guns and boats.

The dingo was introduced from Asia around 5000 years ago and quickly became integrated into Aboriginal societies, where they played a role in hunting and provided warmth on cold nights.

Makassan Trade.


Traders from Makassar (now Ujung Pandang began journeying to the north of Australia in search of trepang, which was prized for its culinary and medicinal values in Chinese markets. The voyages dated from at least 1720, although there are reports of visits perhaps 300 years prior to that, and extended from the Kimberleys in the west, to the east of Gulf of Carpentaria. The Makassans had extensive contact with the indigenous tribes of the Northern Territory, trading cloth, knives, alcohol, and tobacco for the right to fish in Territory waters and use aboriginal labour.

European coastal exploration.
The first recorded sighting of the Northern Territory coastline was by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon aboard the ship Duyfken in 1623. Abel Tasman and numerous French navigators also charted the coast, naming many prominent features. British Admiral Philip Parker King also made surveys of the coast.

European exploration and settlement.
Following the European settlement of Australian in 1788, four unsuccessful attempts were made to settle coastal areas of the Northern Territory prior to the establishment of Darwin. On September 30, 1824 British Captain James Gordon Bremer established Fort Dundas on Melville Island as a part of the Colony of New South Wales. Fort Dundas was the first settlement in Northern Australia, however poor relations with the Tiwi, cyclones, and other difficulties of tropical living led to the Fort being abandoned in 1828. A second settlement was established on the Cobourg Peninsula at Raffles Bay on June 18, 1827. Fort Wellington was founded by Captain James Stirling, however it was also abandoned in 1829.

The British made a third attempt in 1838, establishing Fort Victoria at Port Essington October 27, 1838. Bremer was in command of the new settlement, in July 1839 the HMS Beagle and her crew visited the settlement. Bremer left the settlement in 1839 and following his departure conditions in the settlement deteriorated. Explorer Ludwig Leichhardt travelled from Moreton Bay, overland to Port Essington. An unsuccessful migration scheme was tried, and the first Catholic priest Father Angelo Confalonieri in the area arrived in 1846, however the settlement disbanded on December 1, 1849. 


In 1863 the Northern Territory was annexed by South Australia by Letters patent. Following annexation of the Territory by South Australia a fourth attempt at settlement occurred in 1864. Escape Cliffs, about 75 kilometres from present day Darwin, in 1864. Colonel Boyle Travis Finniss was responsible for the settlement, there were numerous confrontations with the local Marananggu Aborigines, and when he was recalled to Adelaide in 1867 the settlement disbanded. The South Australian government also tried to find sites for additional settlements, sending explorer John McKinlay to search in the region of the Adelaide River, however he had no success.

Finally, on February 5, 1869, George Goyder, the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 men and women at Port Darwin. Goyder named the settlement Palmerston, after the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston. In 1870, the first poles for the Overland Telegraph were erected in Darwin connecting Australia to the rest of the World. The construction of the Overland Telegraph led to more exploration of the interior of the Territory and the discovery of gold at Pine Creek in the 1880s further boosted the young colony's development.

Twentieth century.

On 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia and transferred to Commonwealth control as a result of the Northern Territory Surrender Act 1908 in South Australia and the federal Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910. The Northern Territory (Administration) Act provided that there shall be an Administrator appointed by the Governor-General to administer the Territory on behalf of the Australian Government, subject to any instructions given to him by the appropriate Minister from time to time.Á

For a brief time between 1926 and 1931 the Northern Territory was divided into North Australia and Central Australia at the 20th parallel of South latitude. See A Brief History of the Administration in the Northern Territory Soon after this time, parts of the Northern Territory were considered in the Kimberley Scheme as a possible site for the establishment of a Jewish Homeland, understandably considered the "Unpromised Land".

During World War II, most of the Top End was placed under military government. This is the only time since Federation that an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth.

Indigenous Land Rights.
Indigenous Australians had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the strike and walk off by the Gurindji people at Wave Hill, cattle station in 1966. The Commonwealth Government of Gough Whitlam set up the Woodward Royal Commission in February 1973 set to inquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. Justice Woodward's first report in July 1973 recommended that a Central Land Council and a Northern Land Council be established in order to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.

The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was eventually passed by the Fraser Government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on Australia Day, that is 26 January 1977.

Self-government.
In 1978 the Territory was granted responsible government, with a Legislative Assembly headed by a Chief Minister.

Recent history.
The Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with legal voluntary euthanasia, until the Federal Parliament overturned the legislation. Before the overriding legislation was enacted, three people had been voluntarily euthanasised by Dr Philip Nitschke.

Sir Walter Norris Congreve (VC, KCB, MVO, (November 20, 1862 - February 26, 1927) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 37 years old, and a captain in The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), British Army during the South African War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Action.
On 15 December 1899 at the Battle of Colenso, South Africa, Captain Congreve with several others, tried to save the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery, when the detachments serving the guns had all become casualties or been driven from their guns. Some of the horses and drivers were sheltering in a donga about 500 yards behind the guns and the intervening space was swept with shell and rifle fire. Captain Congreve, with two other officers (Frederick Hugh Sherston (The Hon.) Roberts, Harry Norton Schofield) helped to hook a team into a limber and then to limber up a gun. Although wounded himself, seeing one of the officers fall, he went out with an RAMC Major (William Babtie) and brought him in.

Later Sir Walter.  Father of Major William La Touche Congreve, VC. He later achieved the rank of general. 

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets Museum (Winchester, England).

The first USS Cowell (DD 167) was a Wickes class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War I. She was transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS Brighton, and later to the Soviet Navy as Jarkyi. 

As USS Cowell.

Named for John G. Cowell, she was launched 23 November 1918 by Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Quincy, Massachustts; sponsored by Miss E. P. Garney; and commissioned 17 March 1919, Lieutenant Commander C. E. Van Hook in command. 

Cowell cleared Boston, Massachusetts, 3 May 1919, to take station at Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, first stopping point for the Navy seaplanes which that month began the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. After patrolling her station, she returned to Boston 22 May to prepare for European service, and on 30 June sailed from New York to join the American naval force in the Adriatic. Here she served as dispatch ship for the Allied Peace Commission, and as station ship at Croatian (then in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ports of Rijeka, Split, and Trogir, in turn until 23 October, when she cleared for home.

In reserve at Boston and Charleston from 1 December 1919, Cowell put to sea for a training period out of Newport, Rhode Island, with a reserve organization from April through October 1921, returning to Charleston. On 27 June 1922, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she lay until recommissioned 17 June 1940 for patrol duty in the Atlantic. She cruised along the east coast on this duty until 18 September 1940 when she arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, there to be decommissioned 23 September 1940 and transferred to the Royal Navy the same day in the land bases for destroyers exchange.

See USS Cowell for other ships of this name.

As HMS Brighton. 

Commissioned as HMS Brighton, the destroyer served with minelayers in the Denmark Strait and off the Faroe Islands. On 27 February 1941, she rescued from the sea 19 survivors of torpedoed SS Baltisan. After refit, she served during 1943 and 1944 as target ship for naval aircraft training in the Western Approaches and at Rosyth, Scotland. 

As Jarkyi.

On 16 July 1944 she was transferred to Russia, in whose Navy she served as Jarkyi until returned to the British at Rosyth 28 February 1949.

<doc id="8879165" title="Hinduism in Africa" nonfiltered="815" processed="807" dbindex="450824">
The history of Hinduism in Africa is by most accounts very short in comparison to the histories of Islam, Christianity, or even Judaism in the same continent. However, the presence of its practitioners in Africa dates back to pre-colonial times, even medieval times.  While Arab sailors and armies made frequent contact with the western coast of the Indian subcontinent, Gujarati sailors headed in the opposite direction across the Indian Ocean to sell and trade goods in the ports of the Swahili Coast of what are today known as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. However, they were driven away by the arrival of future colonizers from Portugal.

Hence, Hinduism was only to take root in Africa through the spread of the British Empire, which colonized huge swaths of land throughout the Old World, especially the entirety of the Indian subcontinent and most of the Southern half of the African continent, with added portions of land in North Africa (suceeded by today's modern states of Egypt and Sudan). Many Indians left their homeland to seek their fortunes as soldiers, civil servicemen, and indentured servants throughout the British Empire, settling mainly in the British colonies of Southern and Eastern Africa. Their descendants eventually gained middle-class status in these countries, a position which has changed little in post-colonial Africa.

Hinduism is not usually propagated to the same lengths or through the same means as the other two largest organized religions on the planet.  It has mostly been confined to practice by the Indo-African communities of these countries. However, in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa, a small-scale movement for Hinduism and its propagation outside the Indo-African community has occurred, spearheaded by such individuals such as Swami Ghanananda, the first Hindu swami of Ghana.  Today, Lagos, Nigeria, which did not receive an early influx of Indian migrants as did countries such as South Africa and Uganda, is home to over 25,000 Hindus, mostly converts and recent, post-independence Indian immigrants.  This was primarily the work of ISKCON missionaries. While Hinduism has been cited as possessing many parallels to African spirituality, it has received stiff opposition from the entrenched Christian elites and Muslim minorities of these countries.

<doc id="2325557" title="Caravan of Death" nonfiltered="816" processed="808" dbindex="450825">

The Caravan of Death was a Chilean Army squad that, following the Chilean coup of 1973, flew by helicopter from south to north of Chile between September 30 and October 22, 1973. During this foray, members of the squad ordered or personally carried out the execution of 71 individuals held in Army custody in these northern garrisons. 

The squad was made up of several Army officers and two infantrymen. They were led by Army Brigadier General Sergio Arellano; his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Sergio Arredondo González, later director of the Infantry School of the Army; Major Pedro Espinoza Bravo, an Army Intelligence officer and later operations chief of the DINA secret police; Captain Marcelo Moren Brito, later commander of Villa Grimaldi, the torture camp; Lieutenant Armando Fernández Larios, later a DINA operative and involved in the assassination of Orlando Letelier and others. 

The group traveled from prison to prison in a Puma helicopter, inspecting military garrisons and then ordering   or carrying out themselves   the execution of the detainees, the murders being committed with small arms and bladed weapons. The victims were then buried in unmarked graves.

Though the Rettig Commission puts the count of murdered individuals at approximately 3,000 during the 17-year Pinochet dictatorship, the deaths of these 70 individuals and the Caravan of Death episode itself are highly traumatic, especially as many of the victims had voluntarily turned themselves in to the military authorities, were all in secured military custody and posed no immediate threat because they had no history of violence, nor were they threatening to commit any such violence. 

In June 1999, Judge Juan Guzmán Tapia ordered the arrest of five retired military officers for their part in the Caravan of Death.. In March 2006, Judge Víctor Montiglio ordered the arrest of thirteen former army officers for their participation in the killings on murder charges.

Charoite ((Ca,K,Na)3Si4O10(OH,F)·H2O) is a rare mineral, named for the Chara River (though this etymology is disputed by some), and found only in the Sakha Republic, Siberia,  Russia.  It is found where a syenite massif has intruded into and altered limestone deposits.  

Charoite is a strong, translucent lavender to purple in color, reminding some of a granite or marble with its pearly, swirling luster.  However, it is a discrete mineral rather than a rock, with a hardness of 5-6 and a specific gravity between 2.5 and 2.8.  There is no cleavage, as charoite is strictly massive in nature, and fractures are conchoidal.  It has an unusual swirling, fibrous appearance, sometimes chatoyant, and that, along with its intense color, sometimes of a "grape" nature, can lead many to believe at first that it is synthetic or enhanced artificially. 

Though reportedly discovered in the 1940s, it was not known to the outside world until its description in 1978.  It is said to be opaque and unattractive when found in the field, a fact that may have contributed to its late recognition.  Charoite is used as an ornamental stone and sometimes a gemstone, generally as cabochons set into pendants.

Russia has fairly strict prohibitions on the exportation of charoite.  Generally, charoite is permitted to be exported only after the stone has been worked, for example, into figurines or other type ornaments.  It is therefore difficult to procure "unworked" or "rough" charoite in a form suitable for further working into jewelry such as cabochons.

Charoite often contains inclusions of the mineral tennesite, which appears as golden a golden, spire-like shape running through the material.

<doc id="588088" title="John Wise (clergyman)" nonfiltered="820" processed="812" dbindex="450829">
John Wise (August 1652   April 8, 1725) was a Congregationalist reverend and political leader in Massachusetts during the American colonial period. Wise was noted for his political activism, specifically his protests against British taxation, for which he was once jailed. As the pastor of the Chebacco Parish from 1680 to his death in 1725, Wise lived in Ipswich, often called "the birthplace of American independence."

Biography.
Wise was born in Roxbury, the son of Joseph Wise. Records show that he was baptized on August 15, 1652.

After attending public schools near his home, he was admitted to Harvard College (now Harvard University). After graduating from Harvard in 1673, he began studying theology, and preached in at Branford, Connecticut and Hatfield, Massachusetts. On August 12, 1683, Wise was ordained as the pastor of the newly organized Chebacco Parish, a new parish formed out of Ipswich.

In 1688, Wise led Ipswich citizens in a protest against colonial taxation.

John Wise Avenue, a section of Route 133, is named after him.








John Wise laid vital intellectual groundwork for the American Revolution. If that seems too bold a statement to apply to an intellectual whose work is unknown today, consider that John Wise was selected by Cornell University historian Clinton Rossiter as focus of extensive study as one of six leading early Americans that shaped the course of freedom. Wise was subject of Rossiter's Seedtime of the Republic, a book that traces the origin of Revolutionary political thought in America. Rossiter notes that, although Wise was all but forgotten by the end of the eighteenth century, "There were brave democrats before Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson, none braver than John Wise." (page 226). 

The bravery that Rossiter admires was developed as Wise, a Congregational minister who wrote widely on political and economic thought, fought a brave and lonely battle against Cotton Mather and other church leaders that sought to impose order on the New England churches. His 1717 book, A Vindication of the Government of New England Churches was his most brilliant literary performance and, acccording to Rossiter, the product of years of painstaking reflection.

Wise's political libertarian philosophy was developed from natural rights and Wise credited his own debt to the eminent German jurist Samuel von Pufendorf. But Rossiter notes that Wise is far more accessible than Pufendorf and brought many of Pufendorf's ideas to practical use in preparing for American independence. The key for Wise was liberty, equity, and fraternity through a social contract. 

Wise was an enthusiastic believer that man in a state of nature was a "free-born subject under the crown of heaven and owing no homage to none but God himself." (Rossiter, 216). 

Wise was buried in the yard of his church and rests there to this day under a stone that proclaims:

"For Talents, Piety and Learning he shone 
As a Star of the first magnitude".

Saint Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy () (October 12, 1350, Moscow   May 19, 1389, Moscow) reigned as the Grand Prince of Moscow from 1359 and Grand Duke of Vladimir from 1363 to his death. He was the first prince of Moscow to openly challenge Tatar authority in Russia. His moniker Donskoy (i.e., "of the Don") alludes to his great victory against the Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380).

Early reign.
Dmitry ascended the Muscovite throne at the age of 9. During his minority, the government was actually run by Metropolitan Alexis of Rus. In 1360 the highest dignity among Russian princes, that of Grand Duke of Vladimir, was transferred by a Khan of the Golden Horde upon Dmitri Konstantinovich of Nizhny Novgorod. In 1363, when that prince had been deposed, Dmitri Ivanovich was finally crowned at Vladimir. Three years later, he made peace with Dmitri Konstantinovich and married his daughter Eudoxia. In 1376, their joined armies ravaged Volga Bulgaria.

The most important event during the early years of Dmitri's reign was construction of the first stone Moscow Kremlin, completed in 1367. The new fortress allowed the city to withstand two sieges by Olgierd of Lithuania, in 1368 and 1370. In 1375, Dmitri managed to settle his conflict with Tver in his favour. Other princes of Northern Russia also acknowledged his authority and contributed their troops to his impending struggle against the Horde. By the end of his reign, Dmitri more than doubled Muscovy's territory.

Struggle against the Horde. 


Dmitri's thirty-year reign saw the beginning of the end for Mongol domination of the nation.  The Golden Horde was severely weakened by civil war and dynastic rivalries.  Dmitri took advantage of this lapse in Mongol authority to openly challenge the Tatars.

While he kept the Khan's patent to collect taxes for all of Russia, Dmitri is also famous for leading the first Russian military victory over the Mongols. Mamai, a Mongol general and claimant to the throne, tried to punish Dmitri for attempting to increase his power. In 1378 Mamai sent a small Mongol army, but it was defeated by Dmitri's forces. Two years later Mamai personally lead a large force against Moscow. Dmitri met and defeated it at the Battle of Kulikovo. 

The defeated Mamai was presently dethroned by a rival Mongol general, Tokhtamysh.  That khan reasserted Mongol rule over Russia and overran Moscow for Dmitri's resistance to Mamai. Dmitri, however, pledged his loyalty to Tokhtamysh and to the Golden Horde and was reinstated  as Mongol principal tax collector and Grand Duke of Vladimir. Upon his death in 1389, Dmitri was the first Grand Duke to bequeath his titles to his son Vasili without consulting the Khan.

Hole-in-the-Rock is a natural geological formation in Papago Park, a municipal park of Phoenix and Tempe, Arizona.

Description.

Hole-in-the-Rock is a series of openings (tafoni) eroded in a small hill composed of bare red arkosic conglomerate sandstone. The sandstone was first formed some 6-15 million years ago, and the tafoni are thought to have been eroded by water.  An open, shelter-like chamber in the face of the formation communicates with the rear of the formation via a hole eroded completely through the rock.  Another substantial opening exists in the  ceiling  of the chamber.  There is evidence that the Hohokam, early inhabitants of the region, used and recorded the position of sunlight shining through the latter opening to mark the seasons notably the equinoxes and the solstices, which were marked by carving a slick area (metate) in the rock. Other positions were marked with boulders.

The formation is a popular attraction in the park.  The openings and main chamber, near the summit, are easily accessible via a smoothly ascending path that passes behind the hill. It is also possible to climb the face of the hill to reach the chamber, although this is dangerous for the inexperienced.  The chamber provides a good view of the city of Phoenix west of the park.  A nearly constant wind blows through the openings in the rock.

Randy Newman Live

An intriguing live album from Newman, part of the appeal being that this is the only official live recording released by him. Recorded over three evenings between 17th and 19th September 1970 in front of a small but largely appreciative audience, Newman recalled the event with little sentiment when questioned about it years later. 

Originally intended as a radio promo recording to gain some much needed publicity it clocks in at just over 28 minutes in length and is a brief set sounding hurried at points (the longest song is 2:48 and the shortest 1:16). Although the material is mostly taken from his debut and 12 Songs, albums there are a couple of rarities ("Maybe I m Doing It Wrong" and "Tickle Me") and two songs from the as then unreleased Sail Away album ("Last Night I Had a Dream" and "Lonely at the Top." An audience member requests the former title suggesting that the composition of this song may date earlier than first thought).

Although this is not an essential item in the Newman canon for the casual listener this is of interest to the devoted, not least for the banter with the audience. Newman sounds witty and less guarded than usual and he even offers brief synopses of some of the material. The performance is engaging and is performed with Newman alone at the piano treating the audience to excellent stripped down versions of songs such as "Davy the Fat Boy" and "I Think It s Going to Rain Today." If there were more live releases by Newman then this album would perhaps not be as significant but as it is this is well worth the entrance fee.

Akanda National Park is one of 13 National Parks in Gabon set up in 2002 by President Omar Bongo after a two year study by the DFC, WCS and WWF.  The 13 national parks are designed to represent the biodiversity of the country and encourage tourism. Akanda National Park is located in the northeast of the country, near Libreville,  with coastline along the Mondah and Corisco bays. 

The national park is composed chiefly of mangrove and tidal beach habitats. Gabon has only 2.5% of the total mangrove swamp in Africa, but Akanda together with the nearby Pongara National Park comprise 25% of the total protected mangrove in the continent. They play an important role in the ecosystem and help stabilise the coastline around Libreville. Human encroachment from both building and crop planting are a threat to both parks.

Both of the bays are rich in marine life, and Corisco bay provides an important feeding area for turtles. Akanda is internationally important as a site for migratory birds and is home to the largest populations of such birds in Gabon. It is an IUCN Critical Site.

<doc id="1578416" title="Pforzheimer House" nonfiltered="833" processed="825" dbindex="450842">
Pforzheimer House, nicknamed PfoHo (FOE-hoe) (and formerly named North House or NoHo), is one of twelve undergraduate residential Houses at Harvard University.  It was named in 1995 for Carol K. and Carl H. Pforzheimer, major University benefactors, and their family.





Located in Harvard's Quadrangle, PfoHo comprises Ada Louise Comstock, Daniel Henry Holmes, Mary Buckminster Moors, and Wolbach Halls, in addition to Faculty Row and the Jordan North and South buildings.

PfoHo's shield features black and crimson squares on a crimson and black field; its mascots are the polar bear and the Pf bigram.  The present House Master and Co-Master are Jim and Sue McCarthy.  They have served in this capacity since 1996.

History.
Early years.
Radcliffe College students first took up residence on campus in 1901, and the oldest parts of PfoHo date to that year.

Moors opened in time for the 1949-1950 academic year, the year plans for Holmes were first drawn up.  Construction of Comstock began in 1957.

The Jordans, two separate buildings located at the corner of Walker and Shepard Streets, began as an experiment in cooperative living in 1961. They gradually became used as overflow housing in 1985, although one building persisted as a co-op until at least until 1997. 

Wolbach, formerly an apartment building, was purchased by Harvard by 1964.

The townhouses of Faculty Row joined the House in 1971.

North House.

The name "North House" first appeared in 1961 and consisted of Comstock, Moors, and Holmes.  Wolbach did not yet belong to Harvard at this point.  The Jordans were initially assigned to the no-longer-existent East House.

Male students were first assigned to North House around 1971.

House Master and Co-Master Woody and Hanna Hastings began their term in 1975.

Major renovations of 1986 1988.
They attempted to cultivate house spirit by integrating and interconnecting the buildings.  Woody Hastings remarked, "Any student in North House ought to be able to get from any place in the House to any other place in the House in his PJs - or less."

Accordingly, when plans were drawn up for a major renovation in the mid-1980s, the Hastings rejected an early proposal that would have segmented the house into disconnected vertical "entryways", opting instead for a plan that connected "the bricks" to one another more closely and in the process allowed the construction of the Holmes junior common room, the PfoHo Grille, the Comstock Library, and the centralized balconied dining hall.  The duplex suites on the top floors of "the bricks" were also created during this renovation.

A breezeway connecting Wolbach to Moors, long advocated by Hastings, was constructed in 2002.

Renamed as Pforzheimer.

In 1995, North House was renamed Pforzheimer House.  This caused consternation at first.  Since the Pforzheimers were known primarily as major University donors, there was a widespread sense that naming rights to the building had been sold off. A Boston Globe columnist referred to "the Pforzheimer House flap," saying that "Harvard renamed the Radcliffe-owned house after a loyal donor without consulting President Linda Wilson & Co." The Harvard Noteables (their spelling)wrote five song parodies lamenting the name change.

However, North House Masters J. Woodley and Hanna Hastings said they were "thrilled!" and Hanna was quoted as saying "It's just what we've been asking for. We wanted to be more than a direction." The naming represented the first time that one of Harvard's houses had been named for a Jewish family or person.

Pretty quickly, students grew used to the new name.  The letters f or ph were replaced by pf in House-related words, hence Pformal, PfoHo Pfora, and Pfreshman Welcome.  (Notable exceptions: Faculty Row, Thursdayfest.)

In 1996, the House welcomed new Masters, the McCarthys, to go with its new name.  A central common room in Moors was named for the Hastings upon their retirement.

In 1996, The New York Times noted that, "many black and Hispanic students lived in the Radcliffe quadrangle, in the Pforzheimer House", while the Boston Globe observed that "Pforzheimer, formerly North House,  evolved into a base for black student activism and a mecca for premeds" and observed that "the distinct cultures" of the residence halls was about to be broken up by the then-new policy of assigning students randomly to residence halls.

Dispute with Adams on dining access.

In October of 1999, Adams House began enforcing a long-standing policy of closing its dining hall to non-residents during peak hours, a policy particularly inconvenient to Pforzheimer House residents, who live farthest from the main class buildings at Harvard Yard. A light-hearted "war" erupted between the houses when residents of Pforzheimer House stole the Adams House gong, which Adams House rung to embarrass students from other houses attempting to sneak into their dinning hall. Pforzheimer House also banned Adams House residents from the Pfoho dinning hall, a mostly symbolic gesture.

In response to the stolen gong and the dinning hall ban, Adams House declared that it was "stealing the Pforzheimer Pf", and would henceforth be known as Pfadams House.  To settle this war, Adams and Pforzheimer House agreed to a binding competition, including a football game, a tug-of-war, and a dramatics contest.  An Adams win would result in a return of the gong, continued dinning hall ban, and continued use of "Pfadams House" with Pfoho becoming "Orzheimer House".  A Pfoho win would result in a return to "Adams" from "Pfadams", the return of the gong, and grant Pfoho residents perpetual dinning hall privileges at Adams House.  Pforzheimer House won and Adams accordingly agreed to provide its residents with ID stickers granting them access to the Adams dining hall.

Administration.

As with all houses at Harvard College, Pforzheimer House consists of two classes of members/residents, the Senior Common Room (SCR) and the Junior Common Room (JCR).  The official university administration of the house consists of the resident members of the Senior Common Room, such as the House co-Masters, Allston Burr Resident Dean, Senior Resident Tutors, and the Resident Tutors.  There is also often a non-academic house administrator and a building manager.

As of September, 2006, the House co-Masters of Pforzheimer House were Professor James McCarthy, chair of the Department of Environmental Science and Public Policy, and his wife Sue McCarthy.  The House administrator was Sue Watts.  The Allston Burr Resident Dean was Matthew Peattie.

House Committee.



Student life and house events are administered by the House Committee, or HoCo, whose voting members must be from the Junior Common Room, i.e. the undergraduate student body of the house.  Members of the Senior Common Room may attend HoCo meetings as non-voting participants. As of February 8, 2006 two members of the class of 2007 served as the co-Presidents of Pfozheimer House Committee.

Trivia.
 
PfoHo is home to the studio of Harvard-Radcliffe Television, the only student-run television organization on campus.

 Like all dorms in the (Radcliffe) Quad, PfoHo originally housed females only.  Doors were equipped with special hooks to help residents comply with the Radcliffe College rule that required their doors to remain ajar a certain distance when gentlemen came to call.  While this rule is now obsolete, many of the hooks remain as historical curiosities, intentionally retained through various rounds of renovation.

 PfoHo residents are colloquially known as PfoHosers.  The term actually existed as "NoHoser" before the House acquired its current name.  Combined with the fact that the House was once all-female, this was apparently some sort of joke.  "PfoHoser" has fallen somewhat out of use in recent years, and alternatives like "Pfohomie" have caught on.

 Comstock, Moors, and Holmes are known collectively as "the bricks".  "The bricks" together with Wolbach are called "the House", as in the exchange Do you live in Jordan?   No, I live in the House.;

 The squares on the PfoHo shield represent the four original halls: Holmes, Moors, Comstock, and Wolbach.  The colors were chosen because Harvard's color is crimson and Radcliffe's were black and white.  The design evokes the design of the Radcliffe shield.

 Pforzheimer is the most recently named House; at least as recently as 2002, House administrators' "department" was still listed as NORTH in Harvard's internal directory database.

 PfoHo inspired the name of North House, the band.

 Famous PfoHo alumni include Mo Rocca and Jennifer 8. Lee.

The Bell Tower Suite.

The "Bell Tower Suite" is one of several flagship "named suites" at Harvard College, including Eliot House's Ground Zero, Cabot House's Library Suite, Quincy House's The Terrace (formely known as the Balcony Suite), and Currier House's Ten-Man Suite, and is the largest party suite of Pforzheimer House.

The Bell Tower Suite is Moors Hall #410, which is located directly under Pfozheimer House's bell tower.  It is part of a larger Bell Tower Complex of rooms interconnected by internal fire-escape passageways: the student suites Moors #410, #403, and #404 as well as the bell tower itself (not used for housing).  Frequently, a single group of friends shares Moors #410 and #403, or, more rarely, all three of the suites; in these cases the term "Bell Tower Suite" or even "Bell Tower" refers by extension to all the applicable suites.

The complex is located on the fourth and attic floors of Moors with windows facing out over the Quadrangle, and the tower itself which is accessible by a ladder and trap door on the attic level. One of the largest housing arrangements on the Harvard campus, it can comfortably house twelve students with individual bedrooms, four bathrooms (three full and one half), and three common rooms. Of the interconnected three suites, the largest, Moors #410, has over 1000 square feet (90 m²) of space and has often served as a party venue for students.  The suite is popular among students of Harvard College because it features a ten foot bar of sturdy construction that lends itself to bar-top dancing. Due to current housing regulations at Harvard College, each of the three suites that connect to form the complex must remain single-sex; hence, it either houses twelve same-sex residents or four residents of one sex and eight of the other.

The bell tower itself is an architectural affectation without actual bells, as are most of the bell towers above houses at Harvard College, with the notable exception being that of Lowell House, which features a set of antique bells from a Russian monastery. Access to the bell tower is possible only via a ladder and trap door in the fire-escape passageway that connects Moors Hall #410 and #403. The first ladder leads to the carpeted mezzanine level, which contains the bell tower steel superstructure and an array of overhead lighting.  A long ladder leads via a small hatch from the mezzanine to the highest point in Pforzheimer House, the  lantern of the tower called "crow's nest".  An access door located halfway between the mezzanine and the lantern provides access to an outdoor inter-level widow's walk.  Windows in the lantern allow for an expansive view of the greater Boston area.

<doc id="412726" title="The Elenium" nonfiltered="835" processed="827" dbindex="450844">
The Elenium is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes:

 The Diamond Throne;
 The Ruby Knight;
 The Sapphire Rose;

The series is followed by The Tamuli.

The Elenium is Eddings' second fantasy series, and has proved popular; however, it has been criticised due to the similarity of the plot with previous series.



The Diamond Throne.




Sparhawk, a Pandion Knight, has returned to his homeland Cimmuria after ten years of exile in Rendor.

He finds his Queen and former pupil, Ehlana, has fallen ill, having been poisoned by Annias, the Primate (an ecclesiastical rank) of Cimmuria. Queen Ehlana has been encased in diamond by magic performed by Sephrenia, the Styric tutor of magic to the Pandion Knights. The diamond will keep Queen Ehlana alive for up to 12 months while a cure is found.

To aid him on his quest, Sparhawk takes his childhood friend and fellow Pandion Knight Kalten, his squire Kurik, and Sephrenia. In a show of unity, the other three Church Knight Orders also send their champions to be his companions: Genidian Knight Ulath of Thalasia, Alcione Knight Tynian of Deiria, and Cyrinic Knight Bevier of Arcium.





The Ruby Knight.




Sir Sparhawk and his companions seek the Bhelliom, a powerful magical artifact in the form of a sapphire carved in the shape of a rose, the only object with enough power to cure the rare poison administered to Queen Ehlana. The Bhelliom was last known to have been mounted on the Crown of the Thalasian King Sarak.

The characters travel to the house of Count Ghasek whose sister is ill, as her soul was stolen by Azash, an Elder God of Styricum, whose spirit was confined in a clay idol. Sephrenia and the others manage to cure Lady Belina, though she has been rendered hopelessly mad by destroying the idol which was controlling her power. The Count then tells them about the giant's mound where King Sarak was buried. 

After finding King Sarak's grave they learn that the crown had not been buried with him. They encounter a serf who tells them about the great battle which killed the King and how the Earl of Heid retrieved the fallen King's crown and cast it into the dark murky waters of Lake Randera.
The search for Bhelliom suffers a set back when Ghwerig, the deformed dwarf troll who originally carved the gem into the shape of a rose, retrieves the Bhelliom first after his own centuries-long search to reclaim his beloved gem. 

Sparhawk and his companions follow Ghwerig to his secret cave hidden in the mountains of Thalasia. The book ends with Sparhawk and his squire Kurik killing Ghwerig by throwing him into a bottomless chasm, Bhelliom still clutched in his hand. The girl Flute dives into the chasm only to rise out again with the Bhelliom and depositing it into Sparhawk's hands, thereby revealing her true identity as Aphrael, Child-Goddess of Styricum.

The Sapphire Rose.




Sparhawk now has possession of the Bhelliom, so he returns to Cimmura and uses it to cure Queen Ehlana.  Unfortunately, when returning the symbolic ring of the monarchy to her, she mistakes his action for a marriage proposal.  The engagement has been publicly announced before he has had time to clarify this - although it seems unlikely that Ehlana would have been willing to break the engagement anyway.

Meanwhile, the evil God Azash and his servant, Otha, have been massing their forces along the eastern border of Eosia in preparation for an invasion of the west.  Sparhawk decides, after consultation with his superiors in the Church, to take Bhelliom and travel to Zemoch with several others, with the intention of destroying Azash.

They reach the city of Zemoch, and find the temple which contains the mud idol to which Azash is confined.  By a slightly odd mixture of subtlety and brute force, they gain access to the inner room - but not without the loss of Kurik, Sparhawk's squire and friend.  Sparhawk duels with Martel, another of Azash's accomplices, and kills him; he then goes on to destroy Azash himself, who takes Otha and Annias with him.

Sparhawk returns to his wife and Queen in Cimmura, and the series comes to a close.

<doc id="508100" title="Demon (Dungeons & Dragons)" nonfiltered="836" processed="828" dbindex="450845">
In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, demons are the most widespread race of fiends.  The demons are chaotic evil by nature, and are native to the Abyss.  Demons have no true rulers, though powerful demon lords are able to gain enough power and influence to gain control over sizeable armies of demonic creatures.

Types of demons.
In First Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, some types of demons were not given species names, but were rather referred to as "Type I" through "Type VI" demons.  In subsequent editions, Types I-VI were instead known as Vrocks, Hezrou, Glabrezu, Nalfeshnee, Mariliths, and Balors, respectively. Some of these names were originally given in the First Edition Monster Manual as example names of specific demons of that type, so (for instance) Marilith was the originally the name of an individual Type V demon.

There are currently three known subtypes of demon:

Obyrith.
The obyriths are so ancient that they predate mortal life, and even the gods.  They rarely have a humanoid shape, and some say that just looking at an obyrith can drive a mortal insane.  Some obyrith lords have evolved over time to take on more recognizable shapes, such as Pazuzu or Pale Night.  Other known obyrith demon lords include Obox-ob, Dagon, the Queen of Chaos, the Malgoth, Ugudenk, Bechard, Vroth-Khun, Ubothar, and Cabiri (imprisoned in the Wells of Darkness).  Asima and numerous other obyrith lords whose names were lost to time have been destroyed.

Tanar'ri.
The tanar'ri are a race of numerous demons originally created by the obyriths as slaves.  The tanar'ri eventually revolted against the obyriths, killing most of them, and taking over as the dominant race of demons on the Abyss.  Most known demon lords are tanar'ri, with the exceptions being listed above.

The tanar'ri are essentially classic demons; those that arose as a result of faith and humanity. They're reflections of cruelty and evil and sin, and usually have a basic humanoid shape, although there are several exceptions.

There are many known types of tanar'ri, including: Alkilith, alu-fiend, anzu, armanite, arrow demon, babau, balor, bar-lgura, bulezau, cambion, cerebrilith, chasme, dretch,  glabrezu, goristro, hezrou, jarilith, jovoc, kastighur, kelvezu, klurichir, mane, marilith, maurezhi, molydeus, myrmyxicus, nabassu, nalfeshnee, orlath, palrethee, rutterkin, skurchur, sorrowsworn, succubus, turagathshnee, uridezu, vathugu, and vrock.

Note: The term "tanar'ri" originated with the 2nd Edition AD&D rules, when the words "devil" and "demon" were dropped by TSR from all the rulebooks. This was due to a shift in TSR policy which aimed to minimize the criticism from religious fundamentalists who percieved the game as being satanic in nature. Both terms were restored with the release of Dungeons and Dragons' 3rd Edition ruleset. The term "tanar'ri" was also retained, but applied specifically to a narrow subset of demon.

Loumara.
The loumara are a relatively new demonic race, much younger than the tanar'ri.  They are still centuries old, but this is still recent in a place like the Abyss, where time doesn't mean the same thing it does on the Material Plane. As a result, no loumara has become powerful enough to be  recognized as a demon lord.

Loumara are usually immaterial or invisible demons that are more like ghosts or undead than demons. All loumara can possess living creatures.

Known types of loumara include:

A Dybbuk resembles a jellyfish with a simply sketched human face.  Dybbuks can possess and control dead bodies, so they spend a lot of time looking for a 'perfect' host body to animate -- one that died without violence or major injury, and preferably one that is handsome or beautiful.  After taking the control of a 'perfect' body, dybbuks try to insert themselves into the society of the victim, plunging into depravity and hedonism until their possessed body is broken down and ruined.  When a 'perfect' body is not available, a dybbuk will take a less desirable body and continue to search for a better host.  Dybbuks are lonely creatures, and can be found in groups only where there are many corpses to possess, such as on a recent battlefield.  They tend to avoid undead, because already-animated bodies are of no use to them.

A Guecubu resembles a mass of vapor, and is born from dreamstuff tainted by evil.  Guecubus can possess and control the body of sleeping humanoids. Once they are in control, they 'ride' silently, letting their victim go about his or her business.  At some point they take control and lash out, trying to spread death and murder -- particularly the victim's family and friends.  Sometimes the guecubu will conceal its actions even from the victim, letting them believe that they are cursed or jinxed.

Guecubus believe that killings form some sort of pattern, and enough spilled blood will eventually reveal the meaning of creation in this pattern.  They rarely form groups with other guecubus, preferring to remain hidden and anonymous.  However, many of them can be found in the Dreaming Gulf (230th layer of the Abyss), where they are created spontaneously from the raw, churning chaos of dreams.

Heathrow Connect is a train service in London, connecting Heathrow Airport with Paddington station. It is a joint venture between First Great Western and BAA. The service follows the same route as the faster Heathrow Express service but serves intermediate stations on its route, thus connecting several locations in west London with each other, the airport, and central London. It normally leaves from Platform 11 at Paddington.

The service, which was launched on 12 June 2005, makes use of new four-carriage Class 360 electric multiple-unit trains built by Siemens in Germany. A fifth set has been delivered, but it is a five-carriage train and can not be used until the opening of the Terminal 5 extension, as it will not fit in the headshunt at Heathrow. Once the extension opens, the original batch of units will be returned to Germany to have a fifth carriage inserted. When the  Terminal  5 extension opens, Heathrow Express trains will be diverted to Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 and will no longer call at Terminal 4. Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 will become the new terminus for Heathrow Connect trains.

Fares.
Fares between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington are the same as for First Great Western services, but the single fare between Hayes and Heathrow is £4.90. Travelcards are not valid on the service between Hayes & Harlington and Heathrow, but can be used throughout the rest of the line.

The service is designed principally for the use of BAA staff and locals from West London for travel to Heathrow, and with a staff ID card, discounted fares are available for the journey between Hayes and Heathow. It is not intended to be used as a cheaper (but slower) alternative to the Heathrow Express service from Paddington to Heathrow: every Connect service is overtaken by an Express service en route, and at Paddington trains are advertised on Departures boards as "Heathrow Airport via Hayes and Harlington".  

Operation.
The service uses the slow lines of the Great Western Main Line between Airport Junction and Paddington, replacing some stopping services operated by the former First Great Western Link. To access the airport spur, trains in both directions use the flyover from between the fast and slow lines, to avoid crossing the fast lines. At Heathrow, the trains reverse in the headshunt beyond the station at Terminals 1, 2, 3. When the service started, there was a problem with the signalling in the headshunt, and trains entering the headshunt were unable to leave it. The service was initially curtailed at Hayes and Harlington as a result, except for a few late-night and early-morning services.

The service runs along the Great Western Main Line from Paddington to airport junction (Network Rail owned infastructure). The line from airport junction to the airport terminals is owned by BAA. The line is electrified at 25 kV AC overhead and uses Automatic Train Protection.

Andy Malcolm (born 4 May 1933 in Upton Park, London) is a former professional footballer.

Malcolm joined West Ham in 1948 from Dury Falls Senior School in Hornchurch. He captained England Schoolboys. He signed forms for West Ham in 1950, and received a £10 signing on fee.

Malcolm went on to become a member of the team that gained Ted Fenton's West Ham promotion as Division 2 Champions 1957-58, and in 1959, 6th place in Division One. He was the first West Ham United FC Supporter's 'Hammer of the Year' in 1957-58. 

Described as a  feared wing-half with an ability to close-mark and block out opponents , Andy was able to 'snuff out' the likes of Johnny Haynes, Jimmy Greaves and Denis Law.
Although he was West Ham s first-ever England Youth international and one of the finest wing-halves West Ham ever employed, Andy never won a full cap for his country. In 1959, Malcolm, along with team-mate John Bond, represented the Football League against the Scottish League.

Finding that there was no room for his style of play under Ron Greenwood, Malcolm left Hammers after 283 league appearances, one season away from qualifying for a testimonial match, to captain rivals Chelsea in November 1962, in return for £10,000 and centre-forward Ron Tindall in part-exchange.

A contract dispute with Tommy Docherty and Chelsea s relegation to Division 2 at the end of 1961-62 saw Andy move to Division 3 Queens Park Rangers, for £10,000, where he made 84 appearances under Alec Stock.

He moved to South Africa where he played for the Greek Port Elizabeth side Apollen FC and then Port Elizabeth FC for 2 seasons.

Upon his return to the UK, Malcolm played for Southern League Brentwood Town for 1967-68 season.
He retired from football at the end of the 1960s and, from 1977, was landlord of public houses The Ship and Anchor in Maldon, Essex and The Lion at Latchingdon, Essex, until 1986 when he emigrated to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

<doc id="3737233" title="Phred (Doonesbury)" nonfiltered="842" processed="834" dbindex="450851">
Phred, also known as Nguyen Van Phred, Phredrick or Phreddy, is a character in the comic strip Doonesbury.

He first appeared during B.D.'s tour of Vietnam. Phred was a Viet-Cong guerilla (though he proudly refferred to himself as a terrorist) who captured B.D., and attempted to take him to a POW camp, but they got lost on the way. After days of being lost together in the jungle they finally found a cache of supplies that had been captured and abandoned by Phred's fellow guerillas. It turned out to contain beer.

While drunk, Phred and B.D. put aside their differences and became friends. For the rest of B.D.'s tour of duty, they continually met to share stories and consume alcohol. Despite being on different sides of the war, they got along fine, particularly since Phred made it clear that he had no great devotion to his superiors, and was as cynical and jaded about the war as most American G.I.s.

After the war in Vietnam ended, Phred got work as a freelance guerilla in Cambodia where he organized the transportation of 300 refugees to Washington D.C. where they testified before a senate subcommittee. After that, he somehow became the Vietnamese delegate to the United Nations (even he is not certain why) and served there for many years. Throughout this time, he and B.D. remained in correspondence.

When B.D. finally decided to revisit Vietnam, in order to "bury some ghosts", he found that Phred had become a "mover and shaker", setting up business plans with George, a former member of B.D.'s platoon. They intended to set up a Vietnam War-themed resort where Baby Boomers who were either veterans or guilty about avoiding the war could go to experience it.

It is unknown how this plan panned out, but Phred seems to have left it behind in order to run a Nike factory. One of his many underpaid, abused employees is a cousin of Kim Rosenthal, who has since declared a personal war on the company for the terrible standards that the workers endure. Phred remains as cynical as ever.

The ZK-383 is a heavy submachine gun of Czech origin used during World War II. Czechoslovakians used it, but only as a reserve. It was also issued to the Bulgarian military, as well as some German troops. It was in use after World War II by the Balkan states up until the 1960s.

It is sometimes considered to be a light automatic rifle, but the 9mm Parabellum ammunition is typical of a submachine gun. It stores the ammunition in a 30-round magazine. In addition, the gun has a bipod, a bayonet lug, and an extra long range sight, which is unusual for submachine guns.

<doc id="1257599" title="Basal reader" nonfiltered="845" processed="837" dbindex="450854">
Basal readers are textbooks used to teach reading and associated skills to schoolchildren.  Commonly called "reading books," they are usually published as anthologies that combine previously published short stories, excerpts of longer narratives, and original works.  A standard basal series comes with individual identical books for students, a "teacher's edition," of the book, and a collection of workbooks, assessments, and activities.

Description.
Basal readers are typically highly organized.  Stories are chosen to illustrate and develop specific skills, which are taught in a strict pre-determined sequence.  The teacher's editions are also tightly organized, containing much more than the answer key to the questions that usually appear at the end of each reading passage.  The teacher's book also contains suggestions for pre-reading and post-reading activities and assessments, as well as scripted questions to ask students at specific points in a story.   

Benefits.

The highly pre-planned nature of basal readers is seen as one of their strengths, as this eases the load on teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced.  Specific skills can be easily targeted, tested, and remediated.  Those with very controlled vocabulary usage may ease difficulties for beginning or weak readers.

Criticisms.
Some of the benefits of basal readers are viewed as shortcomings by critics of these books.  Critics charge that they focus on teaching isolated skills, rather than fostering an enjoyment and appreciation of reading for its own sake, and that more time is spent on the supplemental worksheets than on actually reading authentic texts.  The quality of the literature in the reading books is another target of criticism.  Works chosen mainly to allow skills practice may not be particularly meaningful, authentic, or interesting.  

History.


Basal readers have been in use in the United States since the mid 1860s, beginning with a series called the McGuffey Reader.  This was the first reader published with the idea of having one text for each grade level.  Since then, teaching methodologies in school basals have shifted regularly.  The Scott Foresman Company published what is perhaps the most famous basal series, whose stories starred two children named Dick and Jane.  Dick and Jane books emphasized memorizing words on sight, a method which came to be known as "look and say."  This philosophy came under attack in the late 1950s, largely due to Rudolf Flesch's book Why Johnny Can't Read.  This was a scathing condemnation of the "look say" method, and advocated a return to programs that stressed teaching phonics to beginning readers.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the pendulum did swing back toward a more phonics-based approach.  During the latter part of the 1980s, basal usage declined as reading programs began to turn to whole language programs that relied more heavily on trade books, rather than textbooks.  The 1990s and early years of the 21st century have seen a renewed interest in skills acquisition which has sparked a resurgence in basal dominance.

AEP Paphos (Greek:                     ; Athletic Union Paphos) is a cypriot football club based in Paphos. The club was formed in 2000 after the merger of the two clubs of Paphos, APOP and Evagoras. The stadium of the team is Pafiako Stadium located in the city of Pafos in Cyprus. 


 History .
APOP and Evagoras were the two clubs of Paphos playing sometimes in First and sometimes in Second Division. In contrast with the other Districts of Cyprus and other major towns, which had permanent teams in First Division, Paphos did not have because the two clubs could not remain in First Division for many years. For this reason the two clubs were merged to form AEP Paphos because the people of Paphos wanted a permanent team in First Division.

When the two clubs joined to form AEP, APOP was in First Division and Evagoras was in the Second one. Since APOP was in the First Division, the new-formed club of Paphos began its history from the First. They remained there until 2005, when the team for first time relegated to the Second Division. However despite that the team for the season 2005/06 was playing in the Second Division, on April 2006 they had their greatest success as a club since the team qualified for first time to the semi finals of Cyprus Cup by eliminating Olympiakos Nicosia. In the semi finals of the Cup they faced AEK Larnaca and despite the fact that Paphos was not beaten in none of the matches against AEK, they were eliminated with scores 1-1 at home and 0-0 away.

Loituma is a Finnish quartet whose members combine the Finnish vocal tradition with the sounds of the kantele (Finnish zither). Loituma were selected Ensemble of the Year at the 1997 Kaustinen Folk Music Festival.

History.
Loituma s initial incarnation was in the autumn of 1989 as a septet called Jäykkä Leipä ("Stiff Bread"), born in the Sibelius Academy s Folk music department. The original lineup included singers Sanna Kurki-Suonio and Tellu Paulasto, who later left for Sweden to join Hedningarna.

Over the years, the group has persistently followed its own musical path, applying different musical influences to its music. It has dived into musical streams of diverse origins. One of the cornerstones of Finnish folk music is the art of singing: stories and feelings are best conveyed through this instrument. Loituma's songs convey the Finnish heritage, aided in the background by Martti Pokela and Toivo Alaspää. Another cornerstone of Loituma's art is a Finnish folk instrument called kantele, which is featured in varied ways in their recordings.

Loituma members compose or arrange the tunes by themselves, often using improvisation. Lyrics come from many sources, two main traditional sources are the Kalevala, the national epic of Finland, and the Kanteletar. The lyrics are in Finnish, but are also fascinating to non-speakers of that language: Finnish is neither Germanic, Romance, or Slavic which might be expected of a European country. Instead, it is Finno-Ugric, which includes Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian .

<doc id="5761291" title="VID (TV Company)" nonfiltered="853" processed="845" dbindex="450862">
VID is a Russian TV Company that makes the show Wait for Me, designed to help people find their loved ones and also Pole Chudes which is a Russian version of Wheel of Fortune.

History.
The VID TV Company was found in 1990 by Vladislav Listyev when he tried to make his show Vsglyad more funded. VID means "view" in Russian and it was supposed to be a "view" on Russian and Soviet politics. The VID TV company was not able to obtain a separate channel but instead had to base itself on the state First Channel. Listyev later found some other programs including Rush Hour, Field of Wonder, Guess the Melody and Star Hour.

In 1995 Listyev went to work on ORT. He was later killed. VID was then headed by Aleksandr Lyubimov.

VID allowed many celebrities to advance their careers: Sergei Bodrov Jr. was the dictor of Vsglyad after Listyev and Lyubimov, Leonid Yakubovich became a comic figure due to his Field of Wonder appearances and Valdis Pelsh was the dictor of Guess the Melody (himself being a musician). Now the program Wait for Me is led by actor Igor Kvasha.

Symbol.

As the USSR was crumbling the VID TV Company decided that (what was about to be known as) a shocking symbol was appropriate for its logo. They hence chose the, what would become known as, (the) Vid Mask. It was introduced by Vladislav Listyev in 1990 when the company was formed. It is a stone mask that was copied directly from the Museum of Eastern Art in Moscow. The museum then filed complaints to the company. To get themselves out of hot water, the mask was altered using CGI.

The mask resembled something very scary (a somewhat demented version of a man's face) and many complaints from children followed as they were extremely frightened to see the horrible mask appearing each time they watched their favorite show. To add to the fright, it was accompanied by horror music (five-note music; dum-dee, dum-dee, dum!) and bright flashes of black and white light. The flashes were removed in 1999 due to epilepsy concerns and in 2002 the mask was made smaller and placed on a yellow screen instead of a black screen (a black screen inducing more fear due to color contrast).

Originally the logo consisted of the following: a ball is bouncing on a trampoline, falls off and is augmented in size to fill the screen. It then changes colors from black to white to black to white to black and the white Vid Mask appears.     is written underneath.

The VID mask stirred a great deal of controversy in Russia() and many children had psychological problems like phobias because of it. There were petitions to terminate its exposition. In 1999 the flashing lights were removed due to epilepsy complications. The scary music was also removed and a new logo was introduced: a match is lit and the VID mask is formed from smoke.

In 2003 this was replaced by the tiny VID mask on a black and yellow background. Logo specialists have said that a smaller VID mask exposure causes less fright.

Roundstone (Irish: Cloch na Rón) is a village in Connemara, County Galway, Republic of Ireland, located on the west coast of Ireland. The town of Clifden is nearby to the north.

The anglicised name is an error on the part of the British colonial Ordnance Survey or who translated the village name;  while Cloch certainly means Stone or Rock, Rón means Seal, not Round.

The village has a thriving centre for designer/makers, including a bodhran (goat-skin drum) maker and a map maker.

Laisterdyke School is a secondary school and sixth form for boys and girls in Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK. The age range of the pupils is 11-18. The school currently holds Business and Enterprise status, and also uses the name "Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College".

Following the re-organisation of education in the local education authority (LEA) in September 1999 the school changed from a middle school for pupils aged 8 to 13 to its current designation. The school is oversubscribed and continuing to grow. In September 2002, the
school admitted its first cohort of sixth form students and became an 11 to 18 school.

A high proportion of pupils (almost 80 per cent) are from ethnic minority backgrounds and almost all have English as an additional language. Most pupils come from Pakistani backgrounds with smaller numbers from Indian and Bangladeshi backgrounds. Other than English, the main languages spoken are Urdu, Punjabi, Pushto and Hindi. 

As part of their upgrade and new building development, the school has invested in ICT facilities for pupils, staff and surrounding schools.

The school has won a Schools Drug Prevention Charter Award for its efforts in anti-drug education icarried out jointly with local units of the Rotary Club and the Soroptomists Club of Great Britain, as well as with the Bradford Bulls rugby club.

In December 2006, a delegation of educational professionals led by the University of Bradford travelled to Pakistan for a five-day International Education Conference. Representatives from Laisterdyke school were amongst the delegates. The conference was organised following the publication of a report entitled The Mirpur Connection in July 2006. One of its recommendations was to organise an International Educational Conference including practical workshops for teachers, children and young people. The purpose of that visit was to forge links between schools, colleges and Universities in Mirpur and Bradford and to provide a co-ordinated platform for close collaboration between organisations in the Bradford district and those in Mirpur. 

Mirpur is important to many British Muslim communities in West Yorkshire because of the strong social and cultural ties between the communities. These ties began in the 1960s when the families of many Bradford citizens migrated to the region, mainly because of the development of the Mangla Dam, which flooded 485 villages in the 60s making 100,000 people homeless.

John Walter Rutherford (born September 25, 1929, Bruce Rock, Western Australia) is an Australian cricketer who played in one Test in 1956. He was the first Western Australia cricketer to be picked for a "major" cricket tour and the first to win a Test cap for Australia.

Jack Rutherford was a right-handed opening batsman, inclined to be defensive, and an occasional leg-break bowler who played for Western Australia from the 1952-53 season. Until 1956-57, Western Australia played the other Sheffield Shield state cricket teams only once a season, so Rutherford's record of five first-class centuries in his first four seasons was notable enough to win him selection for the 1956 Australian tour to England. In a damp summer, though, he was not a success, scoring only 640 runs at an average of fewer than 23 runs per innings. Only fleetingly, early in the tour, did he look likely to break into the Test team: against MCC at Lord's, he scored a dour 98 and shared a second wicket partnership of 282 with Neil Harvey, who scored 225. But when the team was announced for the first Test, the Australians reverted to the first-choice opening pair of Colin McDonald and Jim Burke. 

On the way back to Australia from England, the team stopped in Pakistan for one Test match and in India for three games: in the second Indian match at Bombay (Mumbai), Rutherford won his solitary Test cap, replacing McDonald. He scored 30 and also took the wicket of Vijay Manjrekar, but McDonald returned for the third match and Rutherford never played Test cricket again. 

He played state cricket for three more seasons, but after top-scoring in the match and achieving his career-best bowling performance for Western Australia against the 1958-59 MCC touring side, he was not selected for the Tests that season and retired at the end of it, reappearing for just a single match two years later.

Afzul Khan was a Bijapuri general killed by Shivaji at Pratapghad in 1658.

Afzal Khan
Shivaji had encamped at Pratapgad Fort, which was strategically advantageous for mountainous infantry action. Afzal Khan tried to garner support of local militarily independent landlords of the mountainous region who nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of Adilshah. But the powerful baron Kanhoji Jedhe, as directed by Shahaji, helped Shivaji to counter these moves and attract their support.

 
Ruins of the Raigad Fort, which served as a capital for Maratha Empire.Shivaji and Afzal Khan arranged a meeting at a shamiyana at the foothills of the fort Pratapgarh (Fortress of Valor). It was agreed that the two would meet unarmed, but were to bring with them ten personal bodyguards each, who were to remain at a distance of one 'arrow-shot' away. Nevertheless, Afzal Khan, as was his reputation for cunning, hid a 'katyar' (a small but very sharp dagger) in his coat. Shivaji pre-empted skullduggery on Khan's part (Khan had got Shivaji's elder brother poisoned and later conspired to get his father, Shahaji, arrested.) and came prepared. Amongst Shivaji's weapons was a small but effective weapon called wagh nakhi which literally means 'the claws of the tiger'. It consisted of an iron finger-grip with four razor claws which could be concealed in the clenched fist. As the two men entered the tent fixed for meeting, the 6-feet-tall overconfident Khan, having little difficulty hiding his swagger, lounged forward pretending of giving an open-armed hug, grabbed the 5'4" Shivaji in his left arm, swiftly drew the hidden dagger and stabbed Shivaji in his back. But as luck would have it, Shivaji was wearing iron gear under his coat and was saved. Thus strikingly made aware of Khan's real intentions, Shivaji opened his fist and disembowelled the Khan with one swift stroke of his "wagh nakhi". Stunned by this sudden turn of events Khan rushed outside shouting for help. Khan's bodyguard, Sayyad Banda, (each had agreed for one guard be placed immediately outside the tent), pounced on Shivaji on hearing Khan's cries and managed to strike him on the head and cut through his turban, but failed to penetrate the steel helmet underneath. Before Sayyad Banda could strike again, Shivaji's bodyguard, Jiva Mahala, who too rushed inside hearing the pandemonium, slashed Banda with his sabre. (The pithy Marathi phrase: 'Hota Jiva Mhanun Vachala Shiva  - 'As there was Jiva, so lived Shiva' - owes its origin to this miraculous act). Afzal Khan managed to hold his gushing entrails and hurtled, faint and bleeding, outside the shamiyana and threw himself into his palanquin. The bearers hastily lifted their charge and began moving rapidly away down the slope when Sambhaji Kavji Kondhalkar, Shivaji's lieutenant and one of the distant guards, went in pursuit, and decapitated the Khan permanently.Krishnaji Bhaskar Kulkarni, Afzhal Khan's envoy charged towards Shivaji and tried to attack him with his sword.Shivaji repulsed the attack and warned Kulkarni not to attack him and that he would not kill him as Kulkarni was a Brahmin.However Kulkarni tried to attack Shivaji again.This time Shivaji slashed Kularni with his sword. 

Shivaji sped up the slope towards the fortress and his lieutenants ordered a concluding bugle to be sounded. It was a pre-determined signal to his infantry, which had been strategically placed in the densely covered valley, to commence battle in case of any treachery on part of Khan, and save the Swaraj(freedom) which was in its infancy .

The severed head of Khan was sent to Rajgarh to be shown to Jijabai. She had long wanted vengeance for the deliberate maltreatment of Shahaji (Shivaji's father) in his captivity by Afzal Khan, and for getting her elder son, Sambhaji, killed through treachery.

Khan's death dealt to the Bijapur Sultan's rule a severe blow from which it never recovered until it was eventually eclipsed by the tyrannical Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

The Maratha's Swarajya on the other hand flourished and blossomed into a muscular Maratha Empire which later spread till Attock near present-day Afghanistan, the seeds of which were laid in this small but breathtaking event amidst the mountainous jungles of Maharashtra.

In physics, the wave nature of light is often exhibited via experiments in which light is made to pass through narrow slits, producing various patterns on a screen placed behind them. Common types include:

 Single-slit experiments which exhibit diffraction.
 Double-slit experiments which exhibit interference as well as diffraction.
 Multiple-slit experiments which lead to more complex diffraction patterns;

A rubber band (in some regions known as a binder, elastic or lacker band or gumband in Pittsburgh and Australia) is a short length of rubber and latex formed in the shape of a loop. Such bands are typically used to hold multiple objects together. The rubber band was patented in England on March 17, 1845 by Stephen Perry.

Manufacturing.
The manufacturing process involves forming the rubber into a long tube, then slicing it along the width of the tube into little bands. While other rubber products may be made using synthetic rubber developed in World War II, rubber bands are still primarily manufactured using natural rubber because of its superior elasticity.

The modern rubber band is different from its ancestor at the time of patenting by Stephen Perry in that rubber is now vulcanized. The vulcanization process makes the rubber more durable and elastic, and therefore makes the rubber band useful.

Measuring and numbering.

A rubber band is given a standard number based on its dimensions.

A rubber band has three basic dimentions: Length, width, and thickness. (See picture.)

A rubber band's length is half its circumference.

Its thickness is the distance from the inner circle to the outer circle.

Lay a rubber band down so that it makes a circle. The band's width is the height of that band or cylinder. If one imagines a long tube of rubber before it is sliced into rubber bands, the band's width is how far apart the slices are cut.

Rubber bands are numbered from small to large, width first. Thus, rubber bands numbered 8-19 are all 1/16 inches wide, with length going from 7/8 inches to 3 1/2 inches. Rubber band numbers 30-34 are for width of 1/8 inches, going again from shorter to longer. For even longer bands, the numbering starts over for numbers above 100, again starting at width 1/16 inches.

Uses.
Because of  the rebound property resulting from a rubber band's elasticity, the rubber band has numerous uses, many recreational and others serious.



 A common way to suspend hard drive(s) in a computer case is to use rubber bands. Suspending hard drive(s) avoids contact between the hard drive(s) and the computer case. This results in reducing vibrations to the case, which reduces noise in the computer case.

 Rubber bands are often used in orthodontics to help realign teeth over a period of time.

 A makeshift eraser can be made by wrapping a rubber band tightly around the end of a pencil.

 Rubber bands can be tied together to create a Chinese jump rope. Many rubber bands wrapped one by one around a core will form a bouncy rubber band ball. ;

 Rubber bands are used during aerobic exercising as fitness tools.

 A rubber band, although it can be very thin, does have a non-zero thickness. Therefore, when a rubber band is fixed on two ends and then twisted upon itself, it is equivalent to being stretched. As a result, the band will try to unstretch by untwisting itself. Based on this property, rubber bands are sometimes used to power model aircraft or other mechanical toys. When the rubber band untwists itself, it will rotate the wings affixed to it.

 Rubber bands can be used as projectiles. The easiest way of doing this is to place one end on the thumb or index finger and stretch the other with the opposite hand. When the latter end is let go, the band will release. Rubber band guns also exist to fire rubber bands, and are generally more accurate. Rubber bands sting if shot at point-blank range against bare skin, but are generally harmless. However, it is best to avoid firing them at another person's face or eyes, bare skin, or at close range. As projectiles, rubber bands are sometimes used in intra-office or school pranks, involving employees or students with many dozens of rubber bands being shot at or between other various employees or students.

Slangs.
In hip hop music, the term "a rubber band" is often used in reference to people with large amounts of money. These people use a rubber band to bind together a bundle of dollar bills.

<doc id="1915344" title="Glad (duke)" nonfiltered="875" processed="867" dbindex="450884">

Glad was, according to the Gesta Hungarorum, a dux (voivod) from Bundyn (Vidin), ruler of the territory of Banat, during the 9th and 10th centuries. He also ruled part of south Transylvania, and Vidin region, and was a local governor or vassal of the First Bulgarian Empire under Bulgarian tsar Simeon. Glad had authority over the Slavs and Vlachs, which consisted most of the population of mentioned regions at the time.

History.

Glad was defeated by the Hungarians during the 10th century. The Hungarians sent an army against duke Glad and subdued the population between the Morisio (Mure ) and Temes (Timi ) rivers. When they tried to pass the Timi  river Glad came against them with a great army including Cuman, Bulgarian and Vlach support. On the following day Glad was defeated by the Hungarians. The Hungarian attack against the duke Glad in Banat is dated in 934.

One of his descendants, Ahtum, was a duke of Banat and the last ruler who opposed to the establishment of the Hungarian Kingdom in the 11th century, but he was too, defeated by the Hungarian Crown.

Name.

In Banat there are still today villages Gladna and Galad, which probably were named after duke Glad. Town Kladovo near Danube in Serbia was probably also named after duke Glad (Original name of this town could be Gladovo, with meaning "a place that belong to Glad" in the Slavic languages). In the 15th century, near the river Zlatica in Banat, fortress Galad was built. Fortress gained that name because place where it was founded was named Galad. There was also a record about Glad monastery (Galadmonostra) in 1426.

The origin of the name Glad is not certain. It could be of Slavic, Latin, or Celtic origin, thought meaning of the name is not clear. The Slavic origin of the name could be supported by the fact that near the Baltic Sea there are places named Gladichov, Glady¨ov, near the river Biese, and Gladi¨ov near the river Radgo¨ . In Balkan region, places with names similar to name Glad could be found in area, where the earliest Slavic names appeared: Gladnica, Gladni , Gladnik, Gladojevi , Gladovi , Gladovi i, Glade, Gladov do, Gladova vrta a, Gladov vrh, Gladov kr¨ (all in Republika Srpska), Gladi¨te (in Montenegro), Gladi¨ev Dol (in Metohia). However, in other parts of Europe there are also placenames like Gala i, Galata, Galatia, Galicia, Calatis, attesting the presence of the Celts (Gauls), or the name could come from latin Gladius or Gladiator. The Romanian historian Neagu Djuvara suggest that Glad probably was a Bulgarian by origin. 

Sources.

Main historical source about duke Glad is historical chronicle known as Gesta Hungarorum, written by Peter, a high priest in Buda, during the time of Hungarian King Bela III in the late 12th century.

<doc id="316392" title="Okakura Kakuzo" nonfiltered="877" processed="869" dbindex="450886">
Okakura Kakuzo (    , February 14, 1863 - September 2, 1913; also known as       Okakura Tenshin) was a Japanese scholar who contributed the development of arts in Japan.  Outside Japan, he is chiefly remembered today as the author of The Book of Tea.

Born in Yokohama to parents originally from Fukui, he attended Tokyo Imperial University, where he first met and studied under Ernest Fenollosa. In 1890, Okakura was one of the principal founders of the first Japanese fine-arts academy, Tokyo bijutsu gakko (Tokyo School of Fine Arts) and a year later became the head, though he was later ousted from the school in an administrative struggle. Later, he also founded Nihon Bijutsuin (Japan Institute of Fine Arts) with Hashimoto Gah  and Yokoyama Taikan. In 1904, he became the first head of the Asian art division of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Okakura was a high-profile urbanite who had an international sense of self in the Meiji Era as the first dean of the Tokyo Fine Arts School (now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music). He wrote all of his main works in English. Okakura researched Japan's traditional art and traveled to Europe, the United States, China and India. He gave the world an image of Japan as a member of the East, in the face of a massive onslaught of Western culture.

His book, The Ideals of the East, (1904), published on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, is famous for its opening line, "Asia is one." He argued that Asia is "one" in its humiliation, of falling behind in achieving modernization, and thus being colonized by the Western powers. This was an early expression of Pan-Asianism.

But then afterward, Okakura was compelled to protest against a Japan that tried to catch up with the Western powers by sacrificing other Asian countries in the Russo-Japanese War. Japan rapidly advanced militarily across Asia, but was forced to do an about-face after its defeat in World War II.

In Japan, Okakura, along with Fenollosa, is credited with "saving" Nihonga, or painting done with traditional Japanese technique, as it was threatened with replacement by Western-style painting, or "Y ga," whose chief advocate was artist Kuroda Seiki.  Beyond this, he was instrumental in modernizing Japanese aesthetics, having recognized the need to preserve Japan's cultural heritage, and thus was one of the major reformers during Japan's breathtaking period of modernization beginning with the Meiji Restoration.

Outside of Japan, Okakura had a remarkable impact on a number of important figures, directly or indirectly, who include philosopher Martin Heidegger, poet Ezra Pound, and especially poet Rabindranath Tagore and heiress Isabella Stewart Gardner, who were close personal friends of his.  For more on this subject, see Benfey, below.

The Chief Scout is the most senior Appointment of Scouting Ireland. As Chairperson of the National Council and National Management Committee the Chief Scout is responsible for co-ordinating the activities of the Association with the help of the National Team for Policy Implementation and Co-ordination. The Chief Scout wears a yellow neckerchief with a thin maroon border and the Scouting Ireland logo embroidered on the apex. 

The first Chief Scout elected was Martin Burbridge, a former member of Scouting Ireland (CSI). His term will end in 2007.

Term of office and roles.
The Chief, like all members of the National Management Committee is elected by secret ballot at the annual National Council for a term of three years. The Chief Scout may be re-elected for one further term of three years.

 Martin Burbridge 2004-2007 .
Martin Burbridge is a native of County Kildare and is a qualified accountant. He holds the Wood Badge is a member of the Order of CúChulainn. As the first Chief Scout of the association, his term of office has been both groundbreaking and controversial. Burbridge had previously been the National Treasurer of Scouting Ireland (CSI) and one of the steering forces behind the formation of Scouting Ireland. Once the wheels had been set in motion in May 2003, Burbridge's appointment was seen by many Scouters as a fait accompli, with neither Peter Dixon nor Donald Harvey (the outgoing Chief Scouts of Scouting Ireland (CSI) and Scouting Ireland S.A.I. respectively) seeking nomination. He became Chief of the Interim National Management Committee, a new leader for a new era in Irish Scouting, and at the first National Council in The Helix his position at the helm was confirmed. 

Among the most contentious issues of his term so far have include the adoption of a new uniform, an entirely new administrative structure and the programme review. Apart from minor teething problems with the uniform, its adoption has been a success. The new Province and County structure and the administrative reshuffle have also been efficient and have been welcomed by grassroots members. All other issues, however, have been overshadowed by the ongoing debate on the possible implications of the programme review and mooted changes to the age ranges for sections. To date the results have not been published and a new programme will be voted on at an EGM of the association in Autumn 2007, after his term has ended. 

The successes of his time in office include the smooth transition from two strong associations to one, operating in 32 counties and catering for almost 40,000 members, successful advertising campaigns which have raised the profile of Scouting nationwide and have increased youth membership and a strong belief in youth participation. Among the criticisms of his term are a lack of communication relating to the failed Castle Saunderson     project, difficulties with funding for campsites, the neglect of camping as a whole and a drop in adult membership in 2005/2006. It is as yet unknown whether he will seek re-election.

Presentation of awards.
Among the responsibilities of the Chief Scout are the presentation of Chief Scout's Awards to Scouts and the investiture of Scouters into the Order of CúChulainn.

<doc id="142749" title="Chordophone" nonfiltered="879" processed="871" dbindex="450888">
A chordophone is any musical instrument which produces sound primarily by way of a vibrating string or strings stretched between two points. It is one of the four main divisions of instruments in the original Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification.

What most westerners would call string instruments are classified as chordophones, violins, guitars, lyres, harps, for example. However, the word also embraces instruments that many westerners would hesitate to call string instruments, such as the musical bow and the piano (which, although sometimes called a string instrument, is also called a keyboard instrument and a percussion instrument).

Hornbostel-Sachs divides chordophones into two main groups: instruments without a resonator which is an integral part of the instrument (which have the classification number 31); and instruments with such a resonator (which have the classification number 32). Most western instruments fall into the second group, but the piano and harpsichord fall into the first. Hornbostel and Sachs' criterion for determining which sub-group an instrument falls into is that if the resonator can be removed without destroying the instrument, then it is classified as 31. The idea that the piano's casing, which acts as a resonator, could be removed without destroying the instrument, may seem odd, but if the action and strings of the piano were taken out of its box, it could still be played. This is not true of the violin, because the string passes over a bridge located on the resonator box, so removing the resonator would mean the strings had no tension.

Electric stringinstruments most of the time have an electromagnetic pickup with which the sound can be amplified.
The Electric guitar is the most famous example, but there are new instrumtens like the overtone koto who make use of the new possibilities the pickupaddition offers.

How Chordophones Work.
Chordophones make their sound when a stretched string vibrates. There is usually something that makes the sound reverberate such as the body of a guitar or violin. The strings are set into motion by either plucking (like a harp), strumming (like a guitar) or by rubbing with a bow (like a violin or cello).  Some common chordophones are the banjo, the dulcimer, the fiddle, the guitar, the harp, the lute, the piano, the ukulele, the viol and the violin.

Merchant Express Aviation used only one aircraft, a Boeing 707 that flew regularly from Africa to European cities, such as Ostend, Belgium. The aircraft's registration was 5N-MXX.

Brief history.
Merchant Express Aviation flew around the 1990s. Just like many other cargo airlines from around the world, the company gave the venerable 707 jet another chance to fly for a company (other cargo airlines use the DC-8 also). Competition from such European cargo airlines like Cargo Lion, Cargolux and Germany's DHL, combined with the poor economical situation of Nigeria during the time (which also had to do with Nigeria Airways' demise) to precipitate the cargo airline company's demise before the 2000s had arrived.

Augusta Savage née Augusta Christine Fells (born February 29, 1892 in Green Cove Springs, Florida; died March 26, 1962 in New York City) was an African American sculptor associated with the Harlem Renaissance. 

She began making clay figures as a child despite her father considering this to be a sinful practice based on his understanding of the "graven images" portion of the Bible. By 1921 she had married James Savage and entered an art program, which she paid for through laundry work. In 1923 she was turned down for a summer art program from the French government because of her race. This led to Herman MacNeil taking her on as a student. She went on to do sculptors of several important figures in the African American, particularly Marcus Garvey.

She was married to Robert Lincoln Poston from 1923 to his death in the following year.

Canadaspis was a genus of crustacean or euarthropod, a benthic feeder that moved mainly by walking and possibly used its biramous appendages to stir mud in search of food. The genus is placed within subclass Phyllocarida in class Malacostraca that includes shrimps and lobsters. 

Once the food was obtained, Canadaspis used its mandibles to grind larger particles. It is possible that its gill flaps were used for locomotion. Canadapsis perfecta, the type species, comes from the Cambrian-age Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada. Canadaspis are also found in different formations of the House Range of western Utah as well as the Pioche Shale of Nevada. Canadaspis laevigata, coming from the Chengjiang biota and thus some 10 million years younger than Canadapsis perfecta, is an equivocal member of the genus. Some scientists believe Canadaspis laevigata to be a more primitive Crustaceomorpha antecedent of Canadaspis, and others consider it a bi-valved arthropod of uncertain affinity.

The phylogeny of Canadaspis, like many Cambrian arthropods is in a state of flux.

The Shetucket River is a tributary of the Thames River, approximately 25 mi (40 km) long, in eastern Connecticut in the United States.

It is formed at Willimantic by the junction of the Willimantic and Natchaug rivers. It flows southeast and south. Approximately 4 mi (6.4 km) northeast of Norwich it receives the Quinebaug River and broadens into a wide estuary which stretches southeast for approximately 5 mi (8 km) and joins the Thames estuary on the south side of Norwich.

The river flows through an especially unspoiled rural section of southern New England, despite the historical prevalence of industry in the surrounding region. Parts of the rivers have been designated by the federal government as the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor. The National Park Service describes the river valley as the "last green valley" in the Boston-to-Washington megalopolis. In nighttime satellite photos, the valley appears distinctively dark amidst the lights of the surrounding urban and suburban regions.

<doc id="3671122" title="Milwaukee Road class A" nonfiltered="895" processed="887" dbindex="450904">



The Milwaukee Road's class A comprised four (#1 #4) high-speed, streamlined 4-4-2 "Atlantic" type steam locomotives built by ALCO in 1935-37 to haul the Milwaukee's Hiawatha express passenger trains.  They were among the last Atlantic types built in the United States, and certainly the largest and most powerful.  The class were the first locomotives in the world built for daily operation at over 100 mph, and the first class built completely streamlined, bearing their casings their entire lives.  Although partially supplanted by the larger F7 "Hudsons" from 1937, they remained in top-flight service until the end.  Locomotive #3 was taken out of service in 1949 and cannibalised for spares to keep the other three running until 1951.  None survive.

They proved highly successful, indeed exceeding design goals.  Designed for keeping a 6  hour schedule between Chicago, Illinois and the Minneapolis-St. Paul "Twin Cities", the class proved themselves capable of handling nine cars on a 6  hour schedule. The only change over the years, except bumps and dents in the casing, was the addition of a Mars light beneath the winged emblem on the nose in 1947.

When introduced, they hauled the fastest scheduled express trains in the world, with average speeds over the whole run, including stops, of greater than 80 mph.  Regular running at 100 mph or greater was required to keep these schedules; the class A locomotives were designed to cruise at over 100 mph and be able to achieve 120 mph.  A recorded run with a dynamometer car behind the locomotive was made on May 15, 1935 by locomotive #2 between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and New Lisbon, Wisconsin.  Over a 14-mile stretch the speed of 112.5 mph was recorded.  This was the fastest authenticated speed reached by a steam locomotive at the time, making #2 the rail speed record holder for steam and the first steam locomotive to top 110 mph.  There are reports, without physical evidence or accurate records, that these locomotives could exceed 120 mph.  Such speeds would have placed the class A in contention with the LNER Class A4 and German BR 05 for the crown of fastest locomotive of all time, but so far no records have been unearthed.

The design was fairly conventional but unusual in some aspects.  One major goal was reducing reciprocating mass, which could not be completely counterbalanced.  This was the reason for the high boiler pressure of 300 lbf/in , which enabled the use of smaller, lighter pistons.  The main rods connected to the first pair of driven wheels rather than the (more conventional) second; again, this reduced the reciprocating mass.  The large 84 inch diameter driving wheels (80 inch was the standard) reduced piston speed and made high speeds less taxing on the machinery.  The streamlined casings were designed to open easily for servicing; the front end contained a pair of clamshell doors to access the smokebox front.

Advertainment is a marketing activity that uses media channels or products typically classified as entertainment for distribution. The key distinction attributed to  advertainment  as opposed to  entertaining advertising  is that the advertising is designed to solicit or promote interaction with the campaign. 

Source: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Transwiki:Advertainment

Advertainment is a marketing method based on the fusion between an advertising(commercial)message and an entertainment content (or format). It is the act of generating entertainment content for a brand. 

The most famous form of advertainment can be seen on Hollywood movies where products and brands take part within plots and stories. Actually the movies were only the beginning of this phenomenon that in the past years have invaded other medias such as TV (sitcoms, live shows, soap operas, etc) and the Internet (advergames, viral videos, webmovies, webisodes, etc). Advertainment's main objective is to transform the advertising into something attractive and desirable instead of just interrupting people to sell something in 30 seconds.

Whitefish Bay is a village in Milwaukee County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 13,508 as of the 2005 census.

Geography.
Whitefish Bay is located at  (43.111711, -87.900762).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 5.5 km² (2.1 mi²), all land.

History.
Whitefish Bay was first settled by Native Americans and later by fishermen and farmers. In 1889, Captain Frederick Pabst, one of Milwaukee's beer barons, spent $30,000 to take advantage of Whitefish Bay's unique location by developing a popular lakeshore resort, which he called the Pabst Whitefish Bay Resort.  

As many as 10,000 visitors would come to the resort on a summer day by horse and buggy, railroad, trolley or excursion steamer. They came to enjoy the scenic view, to ride the Ferris wheel, attend daily concerts (double concerts on Sunday), rent row boats, watch outdoor movies, drink beer and dine on fine fare, including five types of whitefish netted daily in the adjoing bay. The resort's popularity faded in 1914, and the park was closed. In 1915 the land was subdivided into residential lots.

Whitefish Bay's emphasis on education began when farmers in the area demanded local schooling for children living in the area. In 1892, the 392 residents incorporated a village and built a school of their own on a triangle of land now known as Old Schoolhouse Park, across from today's public library.

Whitefish Bay had a surge of home building in the 1920s and a bigger boom in the late 1940s and early 1950s. At its peak in the 1960s and 1970s, the village's population was over 18,000, but it is currently just over 13,500.

Demographics.
As of the census of 2000, there were 14,163 people, 5,457 households, and 4,016 families residing in the village. The population density was 2,555.3/km² (6,610.8/mi²). There were 5,553 housing units at an average density of 1,001.9/km² (2,592.0/mi²). The racial makeup of the village was 95.09% White, 0.98% African American, 0.07% Native American, 2.58% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.26% from other races, and 0.96% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.56% of the population.

There were 5,457 households out of which 40.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 64.7% were married couples living together, 7.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.4% were non-families. 22.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59 and the average family size was 3.09.

In the village the population was spread out with 29.4% under the age of 18, 3.6% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 25.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 92.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.2 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $80,755, and the median income for a family was $95,744. Males had a median income of $63,011 versus $43,893 for females. The per capita income for the village was $39,609. About 2.4% of families and 3.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.2% of those under age 18 and 4.7% of those age 65 or over.

 Pericles concludes a defensive alliance with Corcyra (Corfu), the strong naval power in the Ionian Sea, which is the bitter enemy of Corinth.  As a result, Athens intervenes in the dispute between Corinth and Corcyra, and, at the Battle of Sybota, a small contingent of Athenian ships play a critical role in preventing a Corinthian fleet from capturing Corcyra.  Following this, Athens places Potidaea, a tributary ally of Athens but a colony of Corinth, under siege. ;

The College of DuPage, or COD, is the Midwest's largest single-campus two-year community college, with its main campus located in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. The college also owns and operates facilities in the Illinois communities of Addison, Bloomingdale, Carol Stream, Lombard, Naperville, West Chicago, and Westmont. The college serves students residing in Illinois' Community College District 502, which is most of DuPage County and parts of Cook County and Will County.

The college was established in 1967 in Glen Ellyn, with temporary facilities at 22nd Street (now Fawell Boulevard) and Lambert Road. That very same year the award-winning student newspaper, The Courier published its first issue and has been printing ever since. The first permanent buildings were constructed on this site in the 1970s. Due to the commuting nature of the college's early students, the Chaparral was adopted as the college's mascot. The main campus is also home to WDCB 90.9 FM, a public radio station founded in 1977, as well as the award-winning literary magazine The Little House on the Prairie Review, founded in 1982.

For most of the college's history, it has offered classes in an 11-week-long quarter format, with four quarters (Winter (January-March), Spring (April-June), Summer (June-August) and Fall (September-December)) in a single calendar year. As of August 2005, the college has shifted to a 16-week-long semester format, with Fall and Spring semesters and a continued summer program. The previous summer program would uniquely offer classes in three-, five-, eight-, and 10-week terms.

Between 2004 and 2009, a series of construction projects will add an Early Childhood Education Center, a Technology Education Center, a parking structure, a Health Careers and Natural Sciences building, and a Business and Community Education center to the Glen Ellyn campus, while demolishing three older buildings on the same campus. Other projects during this time period include athletic field and building renovations at the Glen Ellyn campus and projects at the Carol Stream and Naperville facilities.

Hemangioblast is a multipotent cell, common precursor to hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Hemangioblast was first hypothesized in 1900 by W. His. 

Hemangioblasts have been first extracted from embryonic cultures and manipulated by cytokines to differentiate along either hematopoietic or endothelial route. It has been shown that these pre-endothelial/pre-hematopoietic cells in the embryo arise out of a phenotype CD34 population. It was then found that hemangioblasts are also present in the tissue of fully developed individuals, such as in newborn infants and adults.

The Boys from Brazil is a 1978 thriller made by Incorporated Television Company (ITC)  and Lew Grade and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and produced by Stanley O'Toole and Martin Richards with Robert Fryer as executive producer. The screenplay, by Heywood Gould, is loosely based on the novel The Boys from Brazil by Ira Levin. It is not related to another film Boys from Brazil from 1993 ). The music score was by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography by Henri Decae.

The film stars Laurence Olivier, Gregory Peck and James Mason, with Lilli Palmer, Uta Hagen,  Steve Guttenberg, Denholm Elliott, Rosemary Harris, John Dehner, John Rubinstein, Anne Meara,  Jeremy Black, Bruno Ganz, Walter Gotell, Michael Gough, Linda Hayden and Prunella Scales.

Plot.

In the film, Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) clones 94 copies of Adolf Hitler and attempts to have each of the boys undergo the same childhood experiences and rearing that Hitler had, in order to re-create his psyche and breed a new "Hitler for the times" so as to re-establish the Nazi regime.

The film follows the attempts of aging Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier) to discover and thwart Mengele's plan but will Ezra succeed?

Miscellaneous.
The character of Ezra Lieberman (Yakov Liebermann in the Ira Levin novel) in The Boys from Brazil is modeled on the famous real life Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.

Olivier plays a Nazi hunter in this film whilst in Marathon Man (1976), he played Dr. Christian 'The White Angel' Szell , an evil Nazi doctor.

The film was shot on location in Vienna, Austria, England, Portugal and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA.

A new remake of the Ira Levin novel by Brett Ratner as director from a script by Richard Potter and Matthew Stravitz is planned for 2008 or 2009.

The movie is particularly notable for its musical soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith.

Trivia.
 A planned, but unmade movie for the series Batman Beyond was partially based on the film according to Bruce Timm. The concept is that Selina Kyle/Catwoman eventually went straight and would aid Batman against crime. She would make multiple clones of Batman, and of course making sure each boy had the same experiences as Bruce Wayne (including the murder of his parents). The main character Terry McGinnis as well the main enemy of the film are the most successful clones. The movie was rejected due to being darker than the first movie, Return Of The Joker. Story elements, however, were used for the Justice League Unlimited episode, Epilogue.  A deleted scene from the episode does harken to The Boys From Brazil.

 When Rebecca Romjin was interviewed on The Daily Show concerning the movie Godsend, she explains the plot of that movie as being about "A kid who's cloned but the clone turns out 'weird'." Jon Stewart replied with the statement: "Have you ever seen a movie called The Boys from Brazil? Basically they clone a bunch of Hitlers, and they *all* turn out 'weird'.";

 Both of the lead actors, Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier, played General Douglas MacArthur in films produced roughly the same time as Boys From Brazil, Peck in MacArthur (1977) and Olivier in Inchon (1981). Coincidentally, Jerry Goldsmith was the composer for each of those films.

In the Simpsons episode "Blame it on Lisa", Homer states that he doesn't want to go to Brazil, exclaiming "The boys from Brazil are all little Hitlers! I saw it in a movie! Whose name I can't remember!";

In episode 2 of Frisky Dingo, Xander Crews tells his assistant Stan "I don't care what 'Boys From Brazil' thing you have going on in here...", referencing the group of Stan clones that make up the board of Crews's company.

<doc id="7841390" title="Nymphaion" nonfiltered="907" processed="899" dbindex="450917">
Nýmphaion (, , ) was a significant centre of the Bosporan Kingdom, situated on the Crimean shore of the Cimmerian Bosporus, about 17 kilometers south of Panticapaeum. 

There was a Scythian settlement before the Greek colonists set up an emporium on the site in the 6th century BC. The town issued its own coins and generally prospered in the period of Classical antiquity, when its citizens controlled cereal trade, which was vital for the well-being of mainland Greece. Athens chose it as its principal military base in the region ca. 444 BC and Gylon, the grandfather of Demosthenes, suffered banishment from Athens on charges that he had betrayed Nymphaeum during the Peloponnesian War. Annexed to the Bosporan Kingdom by the end of the century, the city gradually declined, although it enjoyed a brief recovery in the early centuries AD. Starting from the 2nd century AD, it was increasingly barbarized by the Sarmatians until the Goths destroyed it in the mid-3rd century.

The site occupied a small hill by the sea. The acropolis contained the temples of Aphrodite (with several rooms) and of the Cabeiri. The lower terrace by the sea centred on the sanctuary of Demeter, first erected in the 6th century BC and several times rebuilt. Other ruins indicate that the town's architecture was unusually refined, perhaps the most sophisticated in the Bosporan Kingdom. One structure has no parallels in the Hellenistic world: it goes back to the 3rd century BC and is built of rose marl. The site also yielded a number of terracotta figurines, winemaking facilities (the oldest along the northern shore of the Black Sea) and several horse burials, associated with the Sarmatians.

The show was made at BBC Pebble Mill and branded as Top Gear Rally Report since unusually it was not made by BBC Sport.  Top Gear presenter William Woollard presented the programme with Tony Mason doing the location reports on the stages. The show's theme music was Jewelled by Propaganda

PodWiki is a wiki engine written in Perl, which primary markup language is Perl POD, but it also supports WikiShorthand, Twiki, TikiWiki and others. PodWiki supports the usual features such as graphics, authentication and authorization, version control of pages and so forth. It comes with a number of so-called formatters, one of them is the blog formatter, which makes it possible to use PodWiki as a blog with wiki features. (or vice versa).

The big difference from other Perl WikiEngines is that PodWiki is 100% customizable, since the whole wiki site is driven by the include feature. PodWiki always loads a page called Autoload, which includes the other stuff, such as the Header, Stylesheet, Menu, the Content-Area, Edit-Bar, Footer etc. This allows the user to fully modify PodWiki's look-and-feel.

In physics, dissipation embodies the concept of a dynamical system where important mechanical modes, such as waves or oscillations, lose energy over time, typically due to the action of friction or turbulence. The lost energy is converted into heat, raising the temperature of the system. Such systems are called dissipative systems. 

For example, a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate. The precise nature of the effects depends on the nature of the wave:  an atmospheric wave, for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass, and at higher levels due to radiative cooling.

Dissipating forces are those which which can not be described by Hamiltonian formalism. Losely speaking, friction and all similar forces which result in decoherency of energy, that is, conversion of coherent or directed energy flow into an indirected or more isotropic distribution of energy.

In computational physics, a numerical dissipation is also known as "artificial dissipation" or "artificial diffusion" or "numerical diffusion". They all mean this: when the pure advection equation--which, by definition, is free of dissipation--is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous to a diffusional process, the method is said to contain 'dissipation'.

A formal, mathematical definition of dissipation, as commonly used in the mathematical study of measure-preserving dynamical systems, is given in the article wandering set.

In river hydrology.
Dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy.  Various devices are designed in streambeds to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms.  Very often these devices look like small waterfalls where water has to flow vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force.

VAVASSOR (Med. Latin valvassor, vasvassor; French vavassour, oavassor, vasseur, &c.), in its most general sense a mediate vassal, i.e. one holding a fief under a vassal. The word was, however, applied at various times to the most diverse ranks in the feudal hierarchy, being used practically as the synonym of vassal. Thus tenants-in-chief of the crown are described by the Emperor Conrad (Lex Lamgob. lib. iii. tit. 8, 4) as valvassores majores as distinguished from mediate tenants, valvassores minores. Gradually the term without qualification was found convenient for describing sub-vassals, tenants-in-chief being called capitanei or bar ones (see BARON); Its implication, however, still varied in different places and times. Bracton (lib. i. cap. 8, 2) ranks the magnates seu valvassores between b.arons and knights; for him they are " men of great dignity," and in this order they are found in a charter of Henry II. (1166). But in the regestum of Philip Augustus (fol. 158) we find that five vavassors are reckoned as the equivalent of one knight. Finally, Du Cange quotes two charters, one of 1187, another of 1349, in which vavassors are clearly distinguished from nobles.

The derivation of the word vavassor is very obscure. The fanciful interpretation of Bracton, vas sortitum ad valetudinem (a vessel chosen to honor), may be at once rejected. Others would derive it from vassi ad valvas (at the folding-doors, valvae), i.e. servants of the royal antechamber. Du Cange, with more justice, regards it merely as an obscure variant of vassus.

Fairfield is a town located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. It is situated along the Gold Coast of Connecticut.  Fairfield is a town of many neighborhoods, two of which -- Southport and Greenfield Hill -- are notably affluent.  As of the 2000 census, the town had a total population of 57,340.  In July 2006, Money Magazine ranked Fairfield the ninth "best place to live" in the United States, and the best place to live in the Northeast.
This is primarliy due to its affluence, low crime rate, excellent public school system, suburban character, and proximity to both New York and scenic Litchfield County.

It considers itself the "dogwood capital of the world."  

Fairfield is home to Fairfield University and Sacred Heart University.

The television sitcom "Who's the Boss?" took place in Fairfield; in certain episodes, particular streets and even neighboring Bridgeport were mentioned. An episode of the Food Network show "Rachael Ray's Block Party" was filmed in Fairfield, as were portions of several episodes of "Ham on the Street."

Fairfield is also the home of Lewis the cat, a feline who attacked several neighbors before the police put a restraining order on him.

 History .
Founding.
In 1639 soon after the Pequot War, Roger Ludlow, a founder of the colony of Connecticut, led a small group of men and a herd of cattle to a place known to the local Paugausetts as Unquowa. They established a settlement that was named for the acres of salt marsh that bordered the mainland shore across from Long Island.

Revolutionary War.
When the Revolutionary War began in the 1770s, Fairfielders were caught in the crisis as much as, if not more than, the rest of their neighbors in Connecticut. In a predominantly Tory section of the state, the people of Fairfield were early supporters of the cause for independence. Throughout the war, a constant battle was being fought across Long Island Sound as men from British-controlled Long Island raided the coast in whaleboats and privateers. Gold Selleck Silliman, whose home still stands on Jennings Road, was put in charge of the coastal defenses. 

In the spring of 1779, he was kidnapped from his home by Tory forces in preparation for a British raid on Fairfield County. His wife watched from their home as, on the morning of July 7, 1779, approximately 2,000 enemy troops landed on Fairfield Beach near Pine Creek Point and proceeded to invade the town. When they left the following evening, the entire town lay in ruins, burned to the ground as punishment for Fairfield's support of the rebel cause. Ten years later, President George Washington noted after traveling through Fairfield, that " the destructive evidences of British cruelty are yet visible both in Norwalk and Fairfield; as there are the chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet."

Fairfield recovered slowly from the burning, but soon after the end of the war its houses and public buildings had all been rebuilt.

Twentieth century.
World War I brought Fairfield out of its agrarian past by triggering an unprecedented economic boom in Bridgeport, the center of a large munitions industry. The prosperity created a housing shortage in the city, and many of the workers looked to Fairfield to build their homes. The trolley and later the automobile made the countryside accessible to these newly rich members of the middle class, who brought with them new habits, new attitudes, and new modes of dress. The prosperity lasted through the twenties. 

By the time of the stock market crash in 1929, the population had increased to 17,000 from the 6,000 it had been just before the war. Even during the Depression, the town kept growing. 

The opening of the Connecticut Turnpike in the 1950s brought another wave of development to Fairfield and by the 1960s the town's residential, suburban character was firmly established.

Population Change.

Fairfield in 2000 had a population of 57,340 people the latest of 2004 put it at a 0.4% increase to 58,900 people, though some estimates of the 2006 September estimate place it at a 2% drop to 56,700 residents which is on par for many cities in the state of Connecticut.

Lake Mohegan, which includes waterfalls called The Cascades, is in the middle of town and is a popular destination for hiking, as is the Fairfield Audubon Society on Burr Street and the Bird Sancutary on Unquowa Road.

Fairfield comprises many neighborhoods.  The best known are wealthy Southport -- where well-known General Electric Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch lived for many years -- and Greenfield Hill, with its large acreages, famous dogwood trees, and picturesque green with white-spired Congregational church.  Other neighborhoods include the Stratfield area, near Bridgeport, the Lake Mohegan area, and the Fairfield Beach area, where many of the Fairfield University students live and as a result there are town/gown tensions. Two shopping districts in town include the Post Road (U.S. Route 1) and Black Rock Turnpike.

<doc id="2554894" title="Service level" nonfiltered="918" processed="910" dbindex="450928">
The term service level is used in Supply Chain Management and in inventory management to measure the performance of an inventory systems.

Under stochastic conditions it is unavoidable that in some periods the inventory on hand is not sufficient to deliver the complete demand and, as a consequence, that part of the demand is filled only after an inventory-related waiting time. 
In an inventory optimization model, the amount of late deliveries can be influenced through the introduction of penalty costs (backorder costs) into the objective function. In addition to the optimal parameters of the inventory policy
under consideration, from the optimal solution of such a model also the optimal size of backorders can be derived.
Unfortunately, this optimization approach requires that the planner know the optimal value of the backorder costs. As these costs are difficult to quantify in practice, the logistical performance of an inventory node in a supply network is measured with the help of technical performance measures. The target values of these measures are set by the decision maker.

Several definitions of service levels are used in the literature as well as in practice. These may differ not only with
respect to their scope and to the number of considered products but also with respect to the time interval they are related to. These performance measures are the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of an inventory node which must be regularly monitored. If the controlling of the performance of an inventory node is neglected, the decision maker will not be able to optimize the processes within a supply chain.

   Service Level .

The   service level is an event-oriented performance criterion. It measures the probability that
all customer orders arriving within a given time interval will be completely delivered from stock on hand, i.e. without delay.

Two versions are discussed in the literature differing with respect to the time interval within which the customers arrive. 
With reference to a demand period,   denotes the probability that an arbitrarily arriving customer order will be completely served from stock on hand, i.e. without an inventory-related waiting time (period  service level):

.

In order to determine the safety stock that guarantees a target  service
level, the stationary probability distribution of the inventory on hand must be known. This version of   is also called ready rate.

If an order cycle is considered as the standard period of reference, then   denotes the probability of no stock-out within an order cycle which is equal to the proportion of all order cycles with no stock-outs (cycle  service level):



This second definition, which is often used in operations management textbooks, is based on the idea of not running out of stock during the time between re-ordering and order arrival (the leadtime).  That is, the probability of demand during that leadtime being less than or equal to the amount of stock you had left when you ordered.  It assumes your reorder point is positive, that orders are in unit increments and inventory is monitored continuously so you can not stock out prior to reordering.

   Service Level (fill rate) .

The   service level (fill rate) is a quantity-oriented performance measure describing the
proportion of total demand within a reference period which is delivered without
delay from stock on hand:



This is equal to the probability that an arbitrary demand unit is delivered
without delay. 

Due to the fact that, contrary to the variations of the  service level, the
 service level does not only reflect the stock-out event but also the
amount backordered, it is widely used in industrial practice.

Also, by the definitions, comparing service levels we always have  .

   Service Level .

The   service level, a time- and quantity-related performance criterion, serves to reflect not only the amount of backorders but also the waiting times of the demands backordered. The   service level is defined as follows:



The   service level is rarely used in industrial practice.

<doc id="3697246" title="Powerplay Cruiser" nonfiltered="919" processed="911" dbindex="450929">
The Powerplay Cruiser was a joystick released in the early 1990s, during the time that the Commodore 64 and Commodore Amiga were both popular home computers. It was compatible with many 8-bit and 16-bit machines, and boasted many features that were considered high end at the time:
 Fully microswitch-based operation (clicking with every move or shot);
 8-directional control;
 Ambidextrous design (symmetrical with two fire buttons positioned at the front end, away from the joystick shaft);
 Adjustable torque control (a 3-position rotating collar at the base of the shaft, giving manual resistance);
 Rugged plastic body & sturdy, long-lasting design (working examples appear for auction on eBay and similar sites to this day);
 Available in a range of colours/models (all with black cable):
 All Black;
 Blue body, red stick, white fire buttons;
 Pastel green body, with pastel yellow fire buttons, pastel pink joystick shaft and pastel blue torque controller;
 The black and red Cruiser Turbo, featuring an autofire facility(the pastel version was arguably the most popular, matching the fashions of the era, followed by the sleek black model);

Other features included a cable that was longer than that used by many other joysticks, and four strong suction cups to attach the unit to a flat surface, for general stability or to enable control of rare (at the time) games that used the keyboard and other input devices to control play, such as Gunship.

 Market value .
The Cruiser retailed in the UK at £14.99 when released, at a time when this was two or three times as expensive as many joysticks with lower manufacturing or design standards, and when most C64 games (on cassette) would cost less than £15 (their disk-based counterparts usually costing £15 or more) and with Commodore Amiga games costing approximately £20-£30. It was therefore a "luxury" joystick, aimed at serious gamers who required style and resilience in their peripherals.

Today retro computing hardware may be bought and sold for very little money, with online auctions often starting at one cent/penny when someone is simply clearing out unwanted clutter.

The Administration of Justice Act, or Act for the Impartial Administration of Justice, also popularly called the Murdering Act or Murder Act, an Act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain (citation 14 Geo III c. 39) and becoming law on 20 May 1774, is one of the measures (variously called the Intolerable Acts, the Punitive Acts or the Coercive Acts) that were designed to secure Britain's jurisdiction over her American dominions.

The act effectively abolished the local administration of justice, providing that the Governor of Massachusetts could direct that any inquisition, indictment or appeal be tried in Great Britain or in another British Colony, providing for coercing any witnesses to appear at such a trial, and requiring bail for any person accused of a "capital crime in the execution of their duty." This means that trials would take place in Britain, under a British judge, ensuring court trials would result in British favor.

Jimmy Ross (born 28th March 1866, died 12th June 1902) was a footballer who played for Liverpool Football Club in the late 19th  century.

Life and playing career.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Ross played for Edinburgh St Bernard and Preston, where he had a very successful time, before being signed by Liverpool manager John McKenna for the princely sum of £75 in 1894. He made his debut in a Football League Division One match on the 13th September 1894 and went on to score 12 times in Liverpool's relegation season. A prolific goalscorer in his time at Liverpool Jimmy found the Second Division defences more to his liking managing to hit the net 23 times in 25 outings  spearheading the Reds charge back to the top tier. 

The following season didn't out quite how Ross would have wanted, although Liverpool managed to establish themselves in the First division, finishing 5th, he only scored twice in his 21 matches.

After his short but eventful spell at Anfield Ross was transferred out signing for Burnley in the March of 1897. He also went on to represent Man City before he retired.

<doc id="147115" title="President of the People's Republic of China" nonfiltered="927" processed="918" dbindex="450937">

The President of the People's Republic of China (, or abbreviated Guóji  Zh xí     ) is the head of state of the People's Republic of China. The office was created by the 1982 Constitution. Formally, the President is elected by the National People's Congress in accordance with Article 62 of the Constitution.  In practice, this election falls into the category of 'single-candidate' elections. The candidate is recommended by the Presidium of the National People's Congress.

The term Zhuxi refers to the chairman in a committee, and was translated as such prior to the 1982 constitution (as in Chairman Mao). The official translation switched to President after 1982 in conformity with Western terminology. However, Zhuxi stayed in Chinese, and in other contexts still corresponds to chairman in English. Meanwhile, the translation of English term President as the head of other states remained Zongtong (), causing a bit of confusion with regard to usage.

 Selection, succession and requirements.

According to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the National People's Congress (NPC), in theory China's top law-making legislature, has the power to elect and force the resignation of the President. By law, the President must be a Chinese citizen of 45 years of age or older. The President cannot serve for over two terms, a term being the equivalent of one session of the NPC, which is five years.

The President promulgates statues adopted by the NPC and NPCSC. The President also has the power to appoint the Premier, Vice-Premiers, State Council members, all ambassadors to foreign countries, Ministers of all departments, and all legislative committee chairs, treasurers and secretaries. The President has the power to give Special Presidential Decrees, and can declare State of Emergency, and declare War. The President is assisted by the Vice-President.

In the event that the President dies or leaves office, the Vice-President automatically assumes presidential powers. In the event that they both are unable to perform normal duties, the Chairman of the National People's Congress will perform the duties of the President as Acting President until the NPC can elect a new President.

 The President and the state .

As the President is legally China's head of state, he is responsible for China's foreign affairs. Since the early 1990s, the President has generally been responsible for establishing general policy and direction for the state and leaves responsibility for the implementation details to the Premier of the People's Republic of China, who is the head of government.  In marked contrast to the system of the Soviet Union when the President was a powerless figurehead, the Chinese Presidency has grown to be quite a powerful position.

 The President and the Party .

Also since the 1990s, it has been general practice for the President to also serve as the General Secretary of the Communist Party.

It is key for the general secretary to seal his power by adding the presidency to his powerful collection of titles. This effectively removes any power tension between the top communist leader and the Head of State.  

 The President and the military .

The relationship between the President and the military is a bit more murky.  The potential for conflict is lessened when, as during the Jiang era, the President is also chairman of the state Central Military Commission.  However, there is a source of potential conflict when this is not the case, shown by the situation in 2003 when top communist leader Hu Jintao was elected President without being elected the CMC chair.  In addition, most of the members of both the Party and the State Central Military Commission are uniformed senior generals, giving the People's Liberation Army a degree of autonomy.  This autonomy, however, is limited by the existence of political officers.

In principle, when the President is also party general secretary, he could order the Party Central Military Commission to order the state Central Military Commission to do something, however how this would work in a crisis is unclear.  

There have been proposals to constitutionally change the system of command to form a National Security Council, modelled after the National Security Council of the United States, which would give the President undisputed command of the military which would then be just another ministry.  These proposals were not actively discussed because of opposition from senior generals and because such acts would be seen as a political attack against the Chairman of the CMC, Jiang Zemin. In September, 2004, Jiang stepped down as Chairman of the commission, and President Hu Jintao became the undisputed Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.

 History of the presidency .

Upon the declaration of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mao Zedong was selected Chairman of the People's Republic of China. Mao, who was also Chairman of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, was clearly the most powerful person in China. In the Constitution of 1954, the President (officially translated as "Chairman") of the PRC was intended to be very powerful, serving both as the Head of State, and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.  The president had special powers to call upon emergency meetings during a crisis or concerns of national security. 

After his failures in the Great Leap Forward, Mao decided to give up the State presidency in 1959. He was succeeded to this post by Liu Shaoqi, who along with Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, took on a more active role in government to curb the excesses of the Great Leap Forward and restore Soviet-based centrally planned economy. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to re-assert his personal power and overthrow the Liu government. The state and party apparatus broke down and in 1968, Chairman Liu Shaoqi was arrested and humiliated by the Red Guards.  

Chairman Liu died in prison and he was not replaced. Mao concentrated powers centrally into the hands of the Party Chairman, and the CMC Chairman, which were further exercised by various Revolutionary Committees. The ceremonial duties associated with the Head of State were subsequently passed to the Chairman of the National People's Congress, the national legislature. The exact reason why Mao Zedong refused to reinstate the presidency was unclear, however it is now known that Mao did not want his political struggle with Liu Shaoqi to be remembered as his attempt to claim the title of the presidency for himself. Lin Biao, then China's number-two figure, advocated for the reinstatement of the position of President, with Mao taking the position and himself becoming Vice-President. Mao later considered this to be a threat to his power, as the Vice-President can legally succeed the President in the event of the latter's death. But during the early 1980s, it became clearer that China needed a person to serve as the Head of State, albeit completely ceremonial. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen and former vice-chairwoman of PRC, was named to be the Honorary President of the PRC before the passage of the Constitution of 1982. 

In the Constitution of 1982, the President was conceived of as a figurehead head of state with actual state power resting in the hands of the Premier of the People's Republic of China and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, both of which were conceived of as being separate people; the President will only hold the office of the President, and not intervene directly in matters of the State Council or the Party. The President therefore held minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries, and signing the appointment of embassy staff. In the original 1982 Constitution plan, the Party would develop policy, the state would execute it, and the power would be divided to prevent a cult of personality from forming as it did with the case of Mao Zedong. Thus in 1982, China perceivably had four main leaders: Hu Yaobang, the Party General Secretary; Zhao Ziyang, the Premier; Li Xiannian, the President; and Deng Xiaoping, the "Paramount Leader", holding title of the Chairman of the CMC.

Subsequent events, however, caused the office to have much larger powers than was originally intended.  In 1989, then President Yang Shangkun was able in cooperation with the then Chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping to use the office of the President to declare martial law in Beijing and order the military crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.  This was in direct opposition to the wishes of Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and probably a majority of the Politburo Standing Committee.

In the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to bitter division, was terminated, and in 1992, the post of President was taken by Jiang Zemin, who as General Secretary and chief of the Central Military Commission continued to make the office of the President a powerful position. When Jiang Zemin stepped down in 2003, the offices of General Secretary and President were once again both given to one man, then Vice-President Hu Jintao.

<doc id="399663" title="Seymour I. Rubinstein" nonfiltered="928" processed="919" dbindex="450938">
Seymour Ivan Rubinstein (born 1934) is a pioneer of the PC software industry. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and later moved to California.  Programs developed partially or entirely under his direction include WordStar, HelpDesk, and Quattro Pro, among others. WordStar was the first truly successful program for the personal computer (in a commercial sense) and gave access to word processing to the general population for the first time.  In some ways he might be called the typewriter killer.

Rubinstein began his involvement with microcomputers as director of marketing at IMSAI. Prior to this, he was a television repairman.

He currently lives in Northern California.

 Business Ventures .
Rubinstein founded MicroPro International Inc. in 1978. MicroPro was the maker of the WordStar word processor. Several IMSAI employees joined him there, including Rob Barnaby (creator of the first version of WordStar, known as "ned"), Bruce Van Natta, Joe Killian, Dianne Hajicek, and Glen Ewing.

In 1982, WordStar was ported to MS-DOS.

"So while WordMaster, SuperSort, and WordStar were developed on IMSAIs (I used mine til I got an IBM PC), few customers used them."
-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 2 May 2000

In 1987 Rubinstein became involved with a spreadsheet called Surpass. This spreadsheet was later sold to Borland International. Borland International renamed it QuattroPro.

In 1990 Rubinstein was sued by IMSI regarding theft of trade secrets regarding WordStar. Rubinstein was successfully defended by Davis Wright Tremaine LLP .

In a Video History Interview with the David Allison of the Smithsonian Institute, Bill Gates referred to Rubinstein as starting one of the first software companies .

In 1995 he founded a company called Prompt Software to investigate document management, internet research, and patent a series of discoveries regarding Content Discovery, this software connected to multiple search sites and used complex word algorithms to refine searches.

One of his most recent associations is with Intesoft Systems.

Stories About Rubinstein.
According to the book The Silicon Jungle, Rubinstein, a science fiction fan, had once asked author Arthur C. Clarke about the possibility of a briefcase computer tapping into information from anywhere in the world. Of course, Clarke had already thought of this, and predicted in Profiles of the Future that businesses would need "only the equivalent of a telephone number".  Around the time of this question, Rubinstein already knew that Epson was going to be marketing a lap-sized machine with WordStar in ROM.

Arthur C. Clarke credited WordStar with bringing him out of the retirement that he announced in 1978.

Part of Rubinstein's legacy is the invention of the $495 selling price for PC software, a price level that ruled the desktop for over a decade. According to Rubinstein, he arrived at this price by walking down Fourth Street in San Rafael, going into businesses and asking them what they'd be willing to pay for word processing software with WordStar's capabilities.

 Quotations .
 "I'm still searching for nirvana"   25 August 1997;

 Improper Credit .
Similar to many early pioneers in the software industry, Rubinstein is sometimes credited with actually writing the software that his companies have marketed.  Some things Rubinstein is improperly credited with are:

Development of a BASIC compiler .  The real BASIC compilers of the day were MBasic   Bill Gates' big success   and CBasic by Gordon Eubanks.  Rubinstein never had any involvement with a BASIC compiler.  He was a COBOL man at that time.

Developing WordStar   The code was actually written by Rob Barnaby .  The base code was originally an IMSAI program called NuEdit, which was spiffed up and named WordMaster in San Rafael, California. The features that turned WordMaster (a programming editor, similar to vi in some ways) into WordStar   the common man's word processor   were mostly Rubinstein's.

"Seymour was the marketing brains   it was he that said we should address word processing to get a larger market.  The defining change was to add margins and word wrap.  Additional changes included getting rid of command mode and adding a print function.  I was the technical brains   I figured out how to do it, and did it, and documented it.  The product's success I think related both to it being the right product (Seymour) and to it being a fairly good implementation given the equipment (me)."
-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 3 May 2000

Developing Quattro Pro   The original Quattro Pro was a DOS program. The development environment   a Modula-2 compiler and a windowing system and a crude spreadsheet   were developed in Texas by a company started by Bob Warfield. Rubinstein bought that program and hired the developers and brought on Bob Richardson, former chief programmer at MicroPro to work on the compiler.  Surpass (the program name) was developed in Novato, California by Bob Warfield, Dave Anderson, Weikuo Liaw, and Bob Richardson.  Barnaby, from the WordStar days did a minor amount of work, as did Jim Fox. Surpass was developed by Surpass Software Systems and at one time was a major spreadsheet competitor as measured by P.C. Magazine. Surpass got great benchmarks and was popular, but due to a bad marketing division was never widely sold.  Ingram was given an exclusive on the program but never sold it because Lotus was a major source of income for them.  Surpass did not have the money to sue.  Quattro was developed by Borland at about the same time sold considerably more units than Surpass and was probably profitable for Borland, but both products were clearly far behind the market leader Lotus.  Phillipe Kahn saw the chance to double the development team and get some new technology ideas by buying the Surpass product at a bargain rate, giving him another shot at gaining the lead.  So the entire operation was sold to Borland who moved the development to Santa Cruz and Scott's Valley.  The Surpass codebase was converted to C and merged with existing Borland code from Quattro to form Quattro Pro, an extremely popular program   although the features such as Hot Links were largely first implemented in Surpass.

Developing WebSleuth   A widely unknown program.  The actual code was written by Garnet R. Chaney and Bob Richardson (formerly of WordStar and Quattro Pro), with minor external help from Jon Hibbins and team with some of the interface design. This company suffered from a lack of funding. The marketing effort there was spearheaded by Penelope Lamars. The product is still being developed by a new company called Intesoft Systems.  Rubinstein is a principal in the new company.

<doc id="8247029" title="Mk 2 mine" nonfiltered="930" processed="921" dbindex="450941">

The Mark II mine was a small British anti-tank blast mine used during the Second World War. The consisted of a body about seven inches (18 cm) in diameter and two inches high (5 cm). The mine has a central fuze well accessed from the bottom, with a main charge in a cavity around the well consisting of about 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of TNT. The mine is fitted with a cover, which acts as a pressure plate. The cover is suspended over the main body of the main by four leaf springs. A Sorbo ring made of Sorbo rubber can be fitted between the cover and the mine body, which absorbs shock and blast and allows the mines to be planted as close as two feet (60 cm) without causing sympathetic detonation (normally five feet is the minimum safe distance). 

Sufficient pressure on the cover of the mine causes the cover to press downward onto the pressure cap of the fuze. This downward pressure forces the assembly surrounding the striker down until the striker retaining balls are aligned with a cavity. The balls are pushed aside and the striker is released impacting the detonator which detonates the C.E. pellet, triggering the exploder and then the main charge. 

The mines main charge was relatively small and the mine appears to have been withdrawn by the end of the war, being replaced by the large Mk 5 mine. However the mine was used in large numbers at the Battle of El-Alamein .

 Diameter: 7 inches (18 cm);
 Height: 3 inches (8 cm) with cover;

<doc id="3017694" title="Chinese eight-ball" nonfiltered="932" processed="923" dbindex="450943">
Chinese eight-ball is a two-player pocket billiards game which combines the play of eight-ball with the shooting style of carom games.

Play.

Set the balls up as you would for eight-ball. The first player breaks by shooting the cue ball into the rack as one normally would. A ball must be pocketed, or two must strike cushions, for the break to be legal. If a ball is pocketed, the breaking player goes again.

The break is the only time players will strike the white cue ball with their cue stick.

From this point forward, balls are pocketed by striking the object ball with the cue stick and causing it to carom off of the cue ball, then go into the called pocket.

Even if a ball is pocketed, the table is still "open," which means that neither player is yet "stripes" or "solids." To determine which object balls one is playing, one must sink an object ball with a legal shot.

Legal shots.

For a shot to be legal, the object ball must strike the cue ball before touching any other ball on the table.

The shooting player must also call the pocket where the object ball will drop.

As with straight pool, the object ball may strike other balls or cushions unintentionally before falling and still count, provided it falls in the called pocket.

When a player pockets one of his or her balls he or she shoots again. When all of the player's object balls have been pocketed, the 8-ball is the final object ball.

Fouls.

If the object ball is in contact with the cue ball when the shot begins, the player must hit away from the cue and strike it by banking off of a cushion. The cue ball may not move before the object ball touches the cushion or it is a foul.

When the cue ball falls in a pocket or leaves the table it is also a scratch. The cue ball is placed at the head spot, or, if occupied, as close as possible to this spot following a line perpendicular to, and moving toward, the head cushion.

In the event of one of the above two fouls, one of the player's pocketed balls comes out and is placed on the foot (rack) spot, or if occupied, as close as possible to this spot following a line perpendicular to, and moving toward, the foot cushion. Any other missed or illegal shot does not result in a pulled ball, unless the ball was pocketed during that shot.

Any opponent's balls pocketed through an illegal or foul shot remain in the pocket. Any of one's own balls pocketed as a result of one's illegal or foul shot come out and are placed on the footer spot, or if occupied, directly behind as already detailed.

If a player makes an illegal shot (which includes not striking the cue ball first with the object ball), his or her turn ends. The opponent may elect to play the balls where they sit. The opponent may also choose to move the white cue ball to the center spot, but only if it is unoccupied.

Winning and Losing.

Scratching while shooting the 8 ball does not result in a loss of game. The balls are replaced according to the foul rules stated above.

Sinking the 8 ball through an illegal or foul shot, or when one has not yet pocketed all of one's object balls, does result in a loss.

The winner of the game is the one who successfully pockets the 8 ball with a legal shot.

Stern-Volmer Relationship.

The Stern-Volmer relationship allows us to explore the kinetics of a photophysical intermolecular deactivation process.

Processes such as fluorescence and phosphorescence are examples of intramolecular deactivation (quenching) processes. An intermolecular deactivation is where the presence of another chemical species can accelerate the decay rate of a chemical in it's excited state. In general, this process can be represented by a simple equation:

A* + B -> A + B 

or

A* + B -> A + B* 

where A is one chemical species, B is another (known as a quencher) and * represents an excited state. 

It is the kinetics of this process which utilises the Stern-Volmer relationship:


If0/If = 1+kQ f


Where If0 is the rate of fluorescence without a quencher, If is the rate of fluorescence with a quencher, kQ is the quencher rate co-efficient,  f is the fluorescence lifetime and  is the concentration of the quencher. 

It is from this relationship that the rate co-efficient of the quencher can be calculated as kQ = 8RT/3 , where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin and   is the viscosity of the solution.

<doc id="3854502" title="Ralph Shapey" nonfiltered="937" processed="928" dbindex="450948">

Ralph Shapey (March 12, 1921 - June 13, 2002) was an American composer and conductor.  He is well-known for his work as a composition professor at the University of Chicago, where he founded and directed the Contemporary Chamber Players. Shapey was a MacArthur Fellow in 1982. 

Although Shapey's style is characterized by angularity, irony, and technical rigor, it eschews the pointillism, anti-emotionalism, and detached austerity of much twelve-tone music.  His work's insistence instead on sweeping gesture, frenetic passion, rhythmic vitality, lyrical melody, and dramatic arc recall Romanticism.  Shapey was dubbed by critics Leonard Meyer and Bernard Jacobson as a "radical traditionalist," which pleased him immensely -- he held a deep respect for the masters of the past, whom he regarded as his finest teachers.  

The French-American composer Edgard Varèse was among Shapey's most important influences.  Both composers shared a fascination with unusual sonorities, counterpoint masses, and the outer extremes of pitch space.  The coordination of static "sound blocks" in Shapey's music also reminds one of another great French composer, Olivier Messiaen, though Shapey reportedly found Messiaen's music saccharine and maudlin.   

Although comparisons are useful, Shapey's compositional voice is undoubtedly personal and distinctive.  Many listeners would call his music "atonal," but Shapey himself denied the label.  He considered himself a tonal composer, and indeed his work, though couched in a highly dissonant harmonic idiom rich in interval classes 1 and 6, does adhere to certain organizational features of tonal music, including pitch hierarchy and object permanence.

In 1992 the Pulitzer Prize for Music jury, which that year consisted of George Perle, Roger Reynolds, and Harvey Sollberger, selected  Shapey's "Concerto Fantastique" for the award.  However, the Pulitzer Board rejected that decision and choose to give the prize to the jury's second choice, Wayne Peterson. The music jury responded with a public statement stating that they had not been consulted in that decision and that the Board was not professionally qualified to make such a decision.  The Board responded that the "Pulitzers are enhanced by having, in addition to the professional's point of view, the layman's or consumer's point of view," and they did not rescind their decision. 

Shapey created a body of over 200 works, many of which have been published by Presser.  Presser also offers his textbook 
A Basic Course in Music Composition, written after over fifty years of teaching the subject.  Recordings of Shapey's music are available on the CRI, Opus One, and New World labels. Shapey's works have been catologued by Dr. Patrick D. Finley in A Catalogue of the Works of Ralph Shapey, published by Pendragon Press

His students include Gerald Levinson, Gordon Marsh, Lawrence Fritts, James Anthony Walker, Frank Retzel, Jorge Liderman, Jonathan Elliott, Deborah Drattell, Ursula Mamlok, Terry Winter Owens and a very broad and exceptional list of others.

 Statement by Ralph Shapey about his work .


 Radical traditionalist  is what I ve been called. My music combines two fundamentally contradictory impulses -radical language and romantic sensibility. The melodies are disjunct and dissonant; they contain "atonal" harmonies and extremes in register, dynamics, and textural contrast. Yet the musical structures are grandly formed and run the gamut of dramatic gestures. Like the Romantics, I conceive of art in a deeply spiritual way. A great work of art transcends the immediate moment into a world of infinity.

My credo is: 1) The music must speak for itself. 2) Great art is a miracle. 3) What the mind can conceive will be done.

<doc id="2397884" title="Xevoz" nonfiltered="938" processed="929" dbindex="450949">
Xevoz (pronounced: ZEE-vohs) are a line of action figures made by Hasbro. They were developed using a joint design and construction style licensed from the STIKFAS action figure line. The toys are noted for having posable, interchangeable body parts, and for being of generally high quality and aesthetic appeal. Xevoz enthusiasts particularly enjoy the high degree of customization options to which the toys lend themselves. 4 waves of figures were released in the United States. The Line still has a large amount of Supporters, two of which entered custom creations in Custom Con 14, and received a large amount of praise for their efforts. There is also an Unofficial Theme song performed by the Indie band Full Fathom.

Sizes.
The line was made available in five "price points": Basic, Deluxe, Two-Pack, Vehicle, and Transporter.   Additionally, a sixth type of figure, the "Special Value" series, was created exclusively for Toys "R" Us.

Basic A single figure with accessories. Basic sets normally retailed for $5-8.

Deluxe A single figure, similar to Basics, but with more accessories and at least one "action feature" (e.g., firing missiles, spring-loaded abilities). Deluxe Figures retailed for $9-$12. 

The two Special Value figures came in the same packaging as Deluxe figures and sold at the same price point.  The Special Value sets were created by combining a recolored Basic toy (either Alpha Ranger or Skull Jack) with a handful of recolored Deluxe accessories (from Sledge Trooper or Inferno Fury, respectively).  The Special Value sets did not include action feature accessories, although Grim Skull included a recolored version of Inferno Fury's missile, without the launcher.

Two-Packs included two distinct figures, each with their own separate accessories. The Two-Packs also included a map-board for use with the Xevoz game pieces.  The two-packs retailed for $14-$18.

The single Vehicle set included two distinct figures, one standard-sized and one larger figure that could be reassembled into several vehicles.  The set retailed for $18-20.

A single Transporter case was released, which contained compartments on the side to store pieces. When opened, it provided a platform to have figures battle one another. The Transporter case included one figure and sold for $30-$35.

Prices for the line fluctuated wildly from retailer to retailer. Basics were selling for $5 at Wal-Mart and $7 at K-B.  The entirety of Wave One and parts of later waves could eventually be obtained for half the initial retail price or less as retailers looked to move the remaining stock.

History.
Xevoz began shipping in January 2004, with early sightings of wave one limited to Toys 'R' Us stores.  Within months, however, the toys could be found at most major retailers. The first three waves of the line were all displayed at the New York Toy Fair in February 2004. 

Wave 2 arrived in late Spring of 2004, adding a few new kits and a few new retail partners, including Wal-Mart and Target. 

Wave 3 came in late Summer and was unevenly distributed.  The figures were found primarily in Target and at online retailers, although some Wal-Marts did receive cases, and when they did arrive, the new figures tended to sell out quickly.  Single-packed figures like Tomb Wraith and Storm Wing rapidly climbed in value as a result. 

The line ended with Wave 4, which was displayed at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2004.  The final assortment, Wave 4 was never released to brick-and-mortar retailers, although a few shops that also had online services did receive the Thunder Shaman set.  Months after the line was thought to have been written off by Hasbro, Wave 4 figures began appearing in Asian stores.  Finally, in the summer of 2005, Hasbro sold the remaining Wave 4 figures to various Internet retailers, including their own HasbroToyShop.com site, causing a run on the long-awaited series.  HasbroToyShop.com's initial offering of the Wave 4 basics sold out within ten hours of their listing on the site.  More recently, Wave 4 basics have been turning up at Big Lots and Tuesday Morning stores in the United States, with at least one person reporting finding the Wave 4 two-pack at a Tuesday Morning.

Future (?).
Despite the unexpected sales of the figures on Hasbro's online store, it is unlikely that Hasbro has plans on continuing the line in any capacity.  The future of this line is said to be non-existent as the Hasbro Xevoz team has been disbanded.  Nevertheless, a small, vocal online fan base continues to support the line.

<doc id="3596898" title="Hindu views on monotheism" nonfiltered="940" processed="931" dbindex="450951">

The very first book of the Rig Veda,1:164:46 states,

   "                           " - ekam sad vipraa bahudhaa vadantya
Truth is One, but sages call it by many names. 
Monotheistic theology was/is an inherent part of  Hinduism which teach that the many forms of God, i.e., Vishnu, Shiva, or Devi merely represent aspects of a single or underlying divine power or Brahman (see articles on Nirguna Brahman and Saguna Brahman). Claims that Hinduism never taught polytheism ,  are correct if we read the major texts of Hinduism such as the Vedas,Upanishads and Gita. 

Certain sects of Hinduism, the Smarta view, is an inclusive monotheistic view of monotheism, as discussed later. This Smarta view dominates the view of Hinduism in the West and has confused all Hindus to be seemingly polytheistic. The Smarta division is the only branch of Hinduism that strictly follows this view. After all, Swami Vivekananda, a follower of Ramakrishna, along with many others, who brought Hindu beliefs to the West, were all Smarta in belief. Only a Smartist would have no problem worshiping Shiva or Vishnu together as he views the different aspects of God as leading to the same One God. God, thus, according to Smarta theology, can have a multitude of aspects and thus, according to this belief, they hold that Vishnu and Shiva are one and the same God. The Smarta theologians have cited many references to support this view. For example, they interpret verses in both the Shri Rudram, the most sacred mantra in Shaivism, and the Vishnu sahasranama, one of the most sacred prayers in Vaishnavism, to show this belief. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the only one true God, worthy of worship and other worship of other forms as subordinate or simply incorrect.

Monotheism can be divided into different types on the basis of its attitude towards polytheism: inclusive monotheism claims that all polytheistic deities are just different names for the single monotheistic God; Smartism, a denomination of Hinduism, follows this belief and holds that God is one but has different aspects and can be called by different names (this belief dominate the view of Hinduism in the West); exclusive monotheism, on the other hand, claims that these deities are false and distinct from the one God, either invented, demonic,  or simply incorrect, as Vaishnavism, a denomination of Hinduism, regards the worship of anyone other than Vishnu. Exclusive monotheism is a well-known tenet in the beliefs of the Abrahamic religions.
In Hinduism, views are broad and range from monism, dualism, pantheism, panentheism, alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars, and strict monotheism, but are not polytheistic as outsiders perceive the religion to be. Hinduism has often been confused to be polytheistic as many of Hinduism's adherents, i.e., Smartas, who follow Advaita philsophy, are monists, and view multiple manifestations of the one God or source of being. Hindu monists see one unity, with the personal Gods, different aspects of only One Supreme Being, like a single beam of light separated into colours by a prism, and are valid to worship. Some of the Hindu aspects of God include Devi, Vishnu, Ganesh, and Siva.  It is the Smarta view that dominates the view of Hinduism in the West. After all, Swami Vivekananda, a follower of Ramakrishna, along with many others, who brought Hindu beliefs to the West, were all Smarta in belief. Other denominations of Hinduism, as described later, don't hold this belief strictly and more closely adhere to a Western perception of what a monotheistic faith is. Additionally, like Judeo-Christian traditions which believe in angels, Hindus also believe in less powerful entities, such as devas.

Contemporary Hinduism is now divided into four major divisions, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. Just as Jews, Christians, and Muslims all believe in one God but differ in their conceptions of him, Hindus all believe in one God but differ in their conceptions. The two primary form of differences are between the two monotheistic religions of Vaishnavism which conceives God as Vishnu and Shaivism, which conceives God as Shiva. Other aspects of God are in fact aspects of Vishnu or Shiva; see Smartism for more information. 
Only a Smartist would have no problem worshiping Shiva or Vishnu together as he views the different aspects of God as leading to the same One God. It is the Smarta view that dominates the view of Hinduism in the West. By contrast, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as the one true God, worthy of worship and other forms as subordinate. See for example, an illustration of the Vaishnavite view of Vishnu as the one true God, at this link. 
Accordingly, many Vaishnavites, for example, believe that only Vishnu can grant the ultimate aim for mankind, moksha. See for example, this link. Similarly, many Shaivites also hold similar beliefs, as illustrated at at this link and at this link.

However, even Vaisnavites, like other Hindus, have tolerance for other beliefs because Lord Krishna, avatar of Vishnu, said so in the Gita. Few views illustrate this view of tolerance: Krishna said: "Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady. However, their wishes are only granted by Me." (Gita: 7:21-22) Another quote in the Gita states: "O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship other lesser deities (e.g., Devas, for example) with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way because I am the Supreme Being. I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services (Seva, Yajna) and Lord of the universe." (Gita: 9:23) Even a Vedic verse illustrates this theme of tolerance. The Vedas are revered in Hinduism, regardless of denomination. For example, a well-known Rig Vedic hymn stemming from Hinduism states that "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously." This is in contrast with some beliefs of other religious traditions, where one must believe in God being one aspect and to totally reject or disdain other beliefs.

Smarta view.

The system prevalent in Hinduism is defined by the Smartha philosophy; this theory allows for the veneration of numberless deities, but on the understanding that all of them are but manifestation of the ONE divine power. That ultimate power is termed Brahman or Atman, and is believed to have no specific form, name or attribute.

Only a Smartha, or follower of the Advaita philosophy, would have no problem worshiping every imaginable deity with equal veneration; he views these different deities as being manifestations of the same God. Other (somewhat peripheral) Hindu sects, such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism conform more closely to a Western understanding of what a monotheistic faith is. For instance, a Vaishnavite considers Vishnu as being the one and only true God, an attitude that resonates with that of the semitic religions. However, the Smartha philosophy defines the mainstream of Hinduism, and imparts to Indic spiritual and religious traditions their renowned liberalism.

Swaminarayana sect view-similar to Smarta view.

Swaminarayan, founder of the Hindu Swaminarayan sect, according to this site,, said in verse 115 of their scripture, Shikshapatri said, "Shree Krishna Bhagwan and Shree Krishna Bhagwan's incarnations alone are worthy of meditation. Similarly, Shree Krishna Bhagwan's images are worthy. And men or devas, even if they are devotees of Shree Krishna Bhagwan or brahmavettaa (knower of divinity), they are still not worthy of meditation - and thus one should not meditate upon them." 

Although followers of Swaminaryan are slanted towards Vaishnavism, Swaminarayan also believed in a Smarta view; he adopted panchadevata system. (five forms of God, as per Smarta theology.
For example, he also recognized a Smarta view, in verses 47, 84,  "And the oneness of Narayana and Shiva should be understood, as the Vedas have described both to be brahmaroopa, or form of Brahman, i.e., Saguna Brahman, thus indicating that Vishnu and Shiva are different forms of the one and same God. He concludes in verse 108,  "And that Ishvara is Shree Krishna Bhagwan (Shree Swaminarayan Bhagwan), who is supreme Parabrahm Purushottam, our Ishta-deva (principal deity), worthy of worship, and the cause of all incarnations."

Give 'em Hell, Harry! is a biographical play and 1975 film, written by Samuel Gallu, which is a one-man show about former President of the United States Harry S. Truman.  It stars James Whitmore and the movie was directed by Steve Binder and Peter H. Hunt.

During a speech by Truman in, Harrisburg, Illinois attacking the Republicans during the 1948 Presidential election campaign a supporter yelled out, "Give 'em Hell, Harry!".  Truman replied, "I don't give them Hell.  I just tell the truth about them and they think it's Hell." Subsequently, "Give 'em Hell, Harry!" became a lifetime slogan for Truman supporters.    

The movie was filmed on the stage of the Moore Theater in Seattle, Washington. James Whitmore was nominated for Best Actor for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe.

The pakhavaj also called mardal, pakuaj, pakhvaj and mardala is an Ancient Indian barrel shaped percussion instrument which is similar to the mridangam. It is famous in North India. It is widely used for orissi dancers and sometimes for kathak.  It is the standard percussion instrument in dhrupad. As with the tabla, the pakhawaj rhythms are taught by a series of mnemonic syllables known as bol.

Playing technique.
Set horizontally on a cushion in front of a crossed-leg pakhavaji the larger bass-skin is played with the left hand, the treble skin by the right hand. The goatskin membranes are looped with leather thongs around the hollowed barrel, which is widest in the middle. Eight pieces of two inch wooden roundstock are pried between thongs and barrel and are hammered tight. The treble skin is fitted with three concentric rings of dense black hardened paste which helps create a sound resonant with harmonics. The treble skin is tuned with a tuning-hammer, holding the instrument in a vertical position, striking down along the rim over the barrel to raise the pitch, turning the pakhavaj on its vertical axis as it is tuned all along the circumference of the skin. The sound emitted by a particular stroke should merge completely with that of the accompanying tanpura. The bass skin is tuned not by adjusting the tension but by applying a ball of dough from aarta,  whole-fiber wheat. Its fundamental tone will be the lower tonic.   
Traditionally, the pakhavaj has been the favoured percussion instrument for performances of the Dhrupad-style, be it vocal, on Rudra-Veena or on Surbahar. These are all capable of employing low registers so the colours match well.

Sound.
The pakhavaj has a low, mellow tone.  The sound of the Pakhavaj is very rich in harmonics. In traditional pakhavaj-styles a student would learn a number of different strokes which produce a specific sound. These are remembered and practiced with corresponding syllables.

The very basic capacity is to play a theka in a particular tala or rhythmic cycle, as for instance chautala in 12 beats: Dha din din dha, dha din din dha tirikata gadi gana Dha.
Advanced students will have learned endless reelas that are virtuoso compositions.

The pakhavaj bears resemblance to the Carnatic mridangam which, however, is smaller in diameter and has a lighter timbre.

There is great pakhawaj player in lucknow ,U.P. P.Rama Kant Pathak.
He is top grade artist of A.I.R. and T.V.

<doc id="7345983" title="Philadelphia Science Fiction Society" nonfiltered="950" processed="941" dbindex="450961">
The Philadelphia Science Fiction Society (PSFS) is a science fiction club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The PSFS is the second oldest group in science fiction fandom.  Anyone living in the greater Philadelphia area and interested in science fiction, fantasy, horror, whether written or on TV or in the movies; SF, fantasy, and horror art;  gaming, board games or video games; comic books/graphic novels; and related arts is welcome. 

The PSFS Constitution requires that a person must have attended three meetings before being voted into membership.  The traditional club greeting for a person voted in is, "Pay your dues!" shouted in unison.

PSFS was formed in October 1935 as a merger of the 11th chapter of the Science Fiction League (chartered the previous January by Milton A. Rothman), and the Boy's Science Fiction Club, founded at about the same time. It adopted its present name in early 1936. According to John Baltadonis (one of its founders), the new name was inspired by an illuminated sign saying "PSFS" on the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society's building.  The idea was that the science fiction group could then claim that the building was its clubhouse.

PSFS meets monthly, usually on the evening of each month's second Friday. There is usually a guest speaker.  The January meeting is the Annual meeting.  The seven members of the PSFS Board (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and the three at-large members) report on their activities for the past year, and elections for new officers are held.

Since 1981, the July meeting of the Society has featured the Hugo Panel.  This panel is made up of five members and a varying number of alternates.  Panel members and alternates read all the nominees for Science Fiction Achievement Awards in the categories of Short Story, Novella, Novelette, Novel, and the long form and short form Dramatic Presentations.  

One panel member summaries all the nominees in a category, with the others adding in afterwards.  All panelists then vote their preference for each nominee, ranking them -- and the traditional "No Award."  Votes are averaged to get the rankings.  The panel is usually held some days before the deadline for voting on the Hugos, and helps those PSFS members who are voting. 

Each panel member and alternate also makes a recommendation for Best and Worst of all of the nominees.  It is not uncommon for the same work to be nominated for both.

PSFS hosts an annual science fiction convention, Philcon, in or near Philadelphia, usually in November.  In 2006, the 70th anniversary Philcon was held at the Sheraton Philadelphia City Center Hotel.  The first Philcon was held in 1936, making the convention the oldest science fiction convention in the world.  See the entry for Philcon for more information on the 1936 convention.

Since 1982, PSFS has sponsored the Philip K. Dick Award for "Best Original SF Paperback", which is awarded every year at Norwescon.

PSFS is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

The shell of a species of Powelliphanta land snail.

Powelliphanta is a genus of giant, carnivorous land snails endemic to New Zealand. They live mostly in tiny pockets of moist native bush in small areas of the North and South Islands, with the greatest diversity of species in the mountains of northwest Nelson. They are sometimes known as amber snails.

There are 21 species and 51 subspecies. The relationship between the species is complex, and it has been suggested that the group Powelliphanta gilliesi-traversi-hochstetteri-rossiana-lignaria-superba forms a ring species. In November 2003 a subspecies, thought to be extinct, was rediscovered alive on the West Coast; it had last been documented on the basis of shell fragments in 1934.

These snails are real giants, with shells up to 9 cm across (Powelliphanta superba prouseorum).

Their striking delicately-patterned shells come in an array of shades, from brown or red to yellow or black. The structure of these shells is very delicate, with a very thin layer of calcium carbonate, covered by a thicker chitinous outer layer. That is why these snails need moist surroundings. Otherwise the outer layer (periostracum) dries up, shrinks and cracks.

They are carnivorous and eat mostly earthworms or slugs. They are nocturnal. They need moist surroundings and live buried under leaf mold and logs.  They can live for 20 years or more and are slow to mature, reaching sexual maturity around 5 years of age. They are hermaphrodites, having both male and female characteristics. They lay 5 to 10 large eggs a year.

Their origin goes back 200 million years to the continent Gondwana. Through their isolation on New Zealand, they have evolved a unique set of characteristics. They are a testimony for New Zealand s unique biodiversity.

An unspecified species of Powelliphanta recently appeared on a New Zealand 40-cent postage stamp.

 Conservation status .
The IUCN Red List states for Powelliphanta marchantii a lower risk, near threatened. But most of these snails are under serious threat or even in danger of extinction. They have no defense against introduced predators, such as Common Brushtail Possums, Trichosurus velpecula, and rats. Many recovery plans are being launched by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. The subspecies Powelliphanta gilliesi brunnea and Powelliphanta traversi otakia are the most threatened.

Since 2004, plans by Solid Energy to destroy the main habitat of Powelliphanta Sp.Augustus while mining for coal have caused controversy, and the species is critically endangered with only between 500 and 1,000 remaining.

D-Company is a criminal organization based primarily in Mumbai, India which is closely linked to a range of organised criminal and terrorist activities in the South Asian (especially India) and the Persian Gulf region, and headed by mafioso Dawood Ibrahim. The reference to "company" in the name of the organisation does not signify that it has a separate corporate identity.

There are a number of unverified claims about the organisation, such as that it generates billions of US dollars from illegal business activities around the globe especially in India. It is also reported that one of India's foreign intelligence organisation, the Research and Analysis Wing, considers that D-Company financed terrorist bombings in Mumbai which killed nearly 200 people in 1993, and that D-Company planned further terrorist attacks in Gujarat following the extensive riots and violence which occurred there in 2002. D-Company is also alleged to run the largest underground business in South Asia. Its operations include arms dealings, drug trafficking, hawala, organised crime and funding of terrorist organisations. D-Company is also believed to have close links with Pakistan's intelligence organisation, the ISI.

At various times it has been linked to the Bollywood film industry, as well as real estate and betting businesses, from which it is said to derive considerable revenue. The film "Company" is based loosely on its activities.

<doc id="160203" title="George II of Greece" nonfiltered="960" processed="951" dbindex="450971">


George II, King of the Hellenes (Greek:           ' rgios                     ) (20 July 1890 1 April 1947) ruled Greece from 1922 to 1924 and from 1935 to 1947.  

He was born at Tatoi, near Athens, the eldest son of Constantine I, King of the Hellenes and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia.

He married, on 27 February 1921 at Bucharest, Princess Elisabeth of Romania, daughter of King Ferdinand I of Romania and Princess Marie of Edinburgh. They had no children, and were divorced on 6 July 1935.

He followed his father into exile in 1917, and returned with him in 1920, after the death of his brother, Alexander and the electoral defeat of Eleftherios Venizelos. He succeeded to the Greek throne on his father's abdication on 27 September 1922.

Following a failed royalist coup in October 1923, he was asked by the government to leave Greece "on leave" while the National Assembly considered the question of the future form of government. He complied and left on 19 December 1923 for exile in Romania. When a republic was proclaimed on 25 March 1924, he was officially deposed, stripped of his Greek nationality and his property confiscated.

His wife stayed in Bucharest whilst he spent more and more time abroad visiting Britain, and his mother in Florence. In 1932 he left Romania permanently and moved to Britain.

In Greece between 1924 and 1935 there were 23 changes of government, a dictatorship and 13 coups. By October 1935 Prime Minister General Georgios Kondylis had decided that the monarchy should be restored as a means of providing some stability and continuity. George refused Kondylis's first offer of the throne, but eventually accepted after a plebiscite on 3 November 1935, appeared to show that he had overwhelming public support. Over 95% of the reported votes supported restoration.

George returned to Greek soil on 25 November. Almost immediately he and Kondylis disagreed over the terms of a general amnesty the King wanted to declare, and George appointed an interim Prime Minister, Professor Konstantinos Demertzis. New elections were held in January, which resulted in a hung parliament with the Communists (who were anti-monarchist) holding the balance of power. A series of unexpected deaths amongst the more well-known politicians (including Kondylis and Demertzis) as well as the uncertain political situation, led to the rise to power of Ioannis Metaxas. On 4 August 1936 George endorsed Metaxas's establishment of dictatorship - the "4th of August Regime".

Despite the regime's quasi-fascist tendencies and strong economic ties to Nazi Germany, George was known to have pro-British feelings at the start of the World War II. On 28 October 1940 Metaxas rejected an Italian ultimatum demanding the stationing of Italian troops in Greece, and Italy invaded. The Greeks mounted a successful defense and eventually occupied the southern half of Albania, but when the Germans invaded from Bulgaria on 6 April 1941 the Greeks were soon driven back.

On 23 April he and the government left the Greek mainland for Crete but after the German airborne attack on the island he was evacuated to Egypt. Once again he went into exile to Great Britain, seemingly at the behest of King Farouk of Egypt and Farouk's pro-Italian ministers.

During the war he remained the internationally recognized head of state, backed by the exiled government and Greek forces serving in the Middle East. In occupied Greece, however, the leftist partisans of the National Liberation Front (EAM) and National Popular Liberation Army (ELAS), now unfettered by Metaxas's oppression, had become the largest Greek Resistance movement, enjoying considerable popular support. As liberation drew nearer, however, the prospect of the King's return caused dissensions both inside Greece and among the Greeks abroad. Although the King effectively renounced the Metaxas regime in a radio broadcast, a large section of the people and many politians rejected his return on account of his support of the dictatorship. In November 1943 George wrote to the Prime Minister-in-exile Emmanouil Tsouderos, "I shall examine anew the question of the date of my return to Greece in agreement with the Government". Either deliberately or accidentally, the version released for publication omitted the words "of the date", creating the impression that George had agreed to a further plebiscite on the monarchy, even though a retraction was issued.

After two changes of Prime Minister, the establishment of a rival Communist-led government in occupied Greece and a mutiny, it was agreed in May 1944 that the fate of the monarchy would be decided in a national referendum. Bowing to Allied pressure, George was forced to appoint Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens as Regent in January 1945. Damaskenos immediately appointed a republican-dominated government. Ill, exhausted and powerless, George bought a lease on a house in Chester Square, Belgravia and made a home there with his long-time mistress.

In elections held on 31 March 1946 the monarchist parties won a clear majority of the parliamentary seats, and the referendum on the monarchy was set for 1 September. Between then and the plebiscite, the electoral registers were revised under Allied supervision. The announced results claimed 69% in favour of the King's return on a 90% turnout. The result fueled Civil War between the communists and the royalists (see Greek Civil War).

On 26 September George returned to Greece to find the Royal Palace looted, the woods at Tatoi chopped down for fuel and corpses buried in shallow graves outside. His country faced economic collapse and political instability. 

On 31 March he was discovered unconscious in his room at the Royal Palace in Athens, and died the following day of arteriosclerosis. When the news was announced some thought it to be an April Fool's joke.

He was succeeded by his brother, Paul. On account of his many exiles, he is said to have remarked that "the most important tool for a King of Greece is a suitcase."

Honours, styles and arms.


In 1941, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for courage under enemy fire, the first and only time a reigning Monarch has received this decoration.

In 1942, he was awarded the Norwegian War Cross.

The Javan tiger (Panthera tigris sondaica) was a tiger limited to the Indonesian island of Java. It now seems likely that this subspecies was made extinct in the 1980s, as a result of hunting and habitat destruction, but the extinction of this subspecies was extremely probable from the 1950s onwards, when it is thought that fewer than 25 tigers remained in the wild. The last specimen was sighted in 1972.  A track count in 1979 concluded that three of the tigers were in existence. However
it is possible that it is not extinct, as in the 1990s, there were some unverified reports of sightings.


Javan tiger reserves .
By 1940 the Javan tiger had been pushed into remote mountain ranges and forests. At this stage some small reserves were set up, but these were not large enough and prey species were too low. 
Come the mid-1950s only 20-25 tigers remained on Java. Half of these were in the well-known Ujong Kulon Wildlife Reserve, but the 1960s saw all tigers eliminated from this area and also from Baluran National Park. 
1972 and  the Javan tiger count was down to a maximum of seven in the then newly-formed Meru Betiri Forest Reserve, and perhaps five elsewhere. 
Meru Betiri was rugged and considered this tiger's last chance for survival. However, even as it was declared a reserve, the area was under attack by agricultural development. A  1979 census located the tracks of only three tigers. Substantiated evidence that this tiger is still alive has not been forthcoming since then.
The exact time of extinction remains unknown, but this was probably sometime in the 1980s.

Continued sightings of the Javan tiger.

Occasional reports still surface of a few tigers to be found in east Java where the forested areas account for almost thirty per cent of the land surface. Meru Betiri National Park, the least accessible area of the island, is located here and considered the most likely area for any remaining Javan tigers. This park is now coming under threat from three gold mining companies after the discovery of 80,000 tons of gold deposit within the locality.

Despite the continuing claims of sightings it is far more likely that, even with full protection and in reserve areas, the Javan tiger was unable to be saved. The 'tigers' are quite likely to be leopards seen from a distance.

At the present time the World Conservation Monitoring Centre lists this subspecies as having an 'outstanding query over status' rather than 'extinct', and some agencies are carrying out experiments using infrared activated remote cameras in an effort to photograph any tigers. Authorities are even prepared to initiate the move of several thousand natives should tiger protection require this.

But until concrete evidence can be produced (expert sightings, pug marks, photographic evidence, attacks on people and animals), the Javan tiger must be considered yet another tiger subspecies which is probably extinct.

<doc id="298818" title="Effects of the automobile on societies" nonfiltered="964" processed="955" dbindex="450975">
Over the course of the 20th century, the automobile rapidly developed from an expensive toy for the rich into the de facto standard for passenger transport.  The development of the automobile built upon the transport revolution started by railways, and like the railways, introduced sweeping changes in infrastructure, manufacturing and legislation. The wide reaching effects of automobiles on everyday life have been a subject of much controversy. Proponents on one end of the spectrum claim the car is a marvel of technology that has brought about unprecedented prosperity, while opponents on the other end claim it lead to a mode of urban and suburban planning that discourages walking and human interaction, uses large amounts of polluting fuel, and drains urban centers of their populations leading to wide-spread urban decay and the neglect of once proud and efficient cities.



 Economic changes .

The development of the automobile has caused changes in city planning, as well as changing the roles of horses and railroads.

Industry restructuring.
Huge industries devoted only to the automobile were created. Others were expanded from once trivial insignificance to eminent importance. Before the internal-combustion engine was developed, gasoline was a waste product, often discarded. Once the automobile became commonplace, the production of gasoline blossomed into a matter of such importance that the governments took action to secure a steady flow of oil. The steel industry was already established, but the coming of the automobile created huge amounts of business for it.  The chemical, rubber, and petroleum industries were remade to suit the needs of the automobile and industries sprang up, such as service stations, motels, and automobile insurance, that were completely reliant upon the automobile for their livelihood.  

As automobiles began to travel at higher and higher speeds, the sign industry began building larger and larger signs and billboards to draw the attention of drivers.   Some urban areas remain pedestrian friendly with many stores, cafes, and other attractions, yet still have a great deal of motor traffic passing through, and hence billboards atop many business buildings.  A pedestrian in these areas is likely not even to notice the billboards, because a pedestrian's attention tends to be focused on the objects in the immediate vicinity.

Infrastructure.
Aside from industries, one of the most visible effects the automobile has had on the world is the huge increase in the amount of surfaced roads. For example, between 1921 and 1941, the United States spent US$40 billion on roads, increasing the amount of surfaced road from 387,000 miles (619,000 kilometers) to over 1,000,000 miles (1.6 million kilometers) which doesn't even take into account road widening.

With increased road-building came loss of habitat for wildlife on a massive scale.  Loss of rural areas and agricultural land to pavement has also been extensive. The quality of roads was also improved. Roads were paved with asphalt, and roads with more than one lane on each side became commonplace. 

In addition to federal, state, and local dollars for roadway construction, car use was also encouraged through new zoning laws that required that any new business construct a certain amount of parking based on the size and type of facility. The effect of this was to create a massive quantity of free parking spaces and to push businesses further back from the road, making it dangerous, if not nearly impossible, for anyone to visit these businesses using means other than a car. Many shopping centers and suburbs abandon sidewalks altogether. This had the effect of encouraging people to drive, even for short trips that might have been walkable, thus increasing and solidifying American auto-dependency. As a result of this change, employment opportunities for people who were not wealthy enough to own a car and for people who could not drive, due to age or physical disabilities, became severely limited.

Technological changes.
Production.
The assembly line and other methods of mass production were developed when American businessmen began seeking ways to build more automobiles at a lower price. The idea of using many small identical parts that could be exchanged for each other was engendered by the president of the Cadillac Automobile Company, Henry M. Leland. Once other automobile makers realized the value of small identical parts that were interchangeable, they hired many small machine shops to make identical parts that were then put together at assembly plants. Because of this, replacement parts could easily be sent to car owners. This  greatly prolonged the life of the automobile, making it even more attractive to consumers.

Ransom E. Olds took the first step towards assembly line production when he had the framework of each automobile pushed on a wooden platform supported by rolling casters. Henry Ford built on this when he used conveyor belts to pull along the bare frame of an automobile while workmen added parts to it that were brought to them by other conveyor belts. Ford's utilization of the conveyor belt in the factory was inspired by the Chicago Packing Association's disassembly line, where workers dressed beef pulled along by an overhead trolley.

Cultural changes.
Prior to the appearance of the automobile, horses, walking, streetcars and bicycles were the major modes of transportation within cities. Horses require a large amount of care, and were therefore kept in public facilities that were usually far from residences. The manure they left on the streets also created a sanitation problem. The automobile had neither of those disadvantages.

The automobile made regular medium-distance travel more convenient and affordable, also in areas without railways. Because automobiles did not require rest, and were faster than horse-drawn conveyances, people were routinely able to travel farther than in earlier times. Historically, most people never travelled more than a few dozen kilometres from their birthplace in their entire lives ; the advent of the automobile began the transformation of society in such a way that those who had never travelled that distance were only a tiny minority.  Some experts suggest that many of these changes began during the Golden age of the bicycle, the preceding era from 1880 1915.

Changes to urban society.

Beginning in the 1940s, most urban environments in United States lost their streetcars, Cable cars, and other forms of light rail, to be replaced by diesel-burning motor coaches or buses.  Many of these have never returned, though some urban communities eventually installed subways.  

Another change brought about by the automobile is that modern urban pedestrians must be more alert than their ancestors.  In the past, a pedestrian had to worry about relatively slow-moving streetcars, or getting kicked in the face by horses, or stepping in horse dung.  With the proliferation of the automobile, a pedestrian has to worry about being hit by automobiles at high speeds, and breathing noxious exhaust fumes.  The Futurama exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair showed a City of the Future in which pedestrian and automobile traffic was fully grade-separated.  However, for cost reasons, this vision has never come to pass outside of small-scale skyways in a few downtowns.  

The loss of pedestrian-scale villages has also disconnected communities.  People have less contact with their neighbors and rarely walk unless they place a high value on exercise. Also, drivers lose  time stuck in traffic jams, and today people rarely get the recommended amount of exercise to stay healthy.  In fact, since the 1980s, obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.

In areas with high crime rates, people who do exercise usually prefer to do so in the safety of their home or in subscriber-only fitness clubs (which they drive to and from).


Advent of suburban society.
Because of the automobile, the outward growth of cities accelerated, and suburbs began developing rapidly for the first time.  Until the advent of the automobile, factory workers lived either close to the factory or in high density communities further away, connected to the factory by streetcar or rail. The automobile and the federal subsides for roads and suburban development that supported car culture allowed people to live in low density communities far from the city center and integrated city neighborhoods. The developing suburbs created few local jobs, due to single use zoning. Hence, residents commuted longer distances to work each day as the suburbs expanded. 

Shopping centers were built in or near suburbs to save residents trips to the city. The shopping centers provided goods and services further reducing the need for suburban residents to visit the city.

Finally, as the service economy gained importance, business parks appeared, allowing suburb dwellers to work in the suburbs. The automobile caused the decentralisation of cities, segregating land use and ethnicities, while increasing the ecological footprint of their residents.

Car culture.
The car had a significant effect on the culture of the middle class. Automobiles were incorporated into all parts of life from music to books to movies. Between 1905 and 1908, more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject. The automotive themes of these songs reflected the general culture of the automotive industry: sexual adventure, liberation from social control, and masculine power. Books centered on motor boys who liberated themselves from the average, normal, middle class life, to travel and seek adventure in the exotic. Car ownership came to be associated with independence, freedom, and increased status.

Changes to individual lifestyle in America.

At the end of the 19th century, Americans put a great deal of emphasis on personal freedom and individual mobility. The automobile encompassed both of these ideals. Individuality was increased for the automobile owner. This individual zeal didn t apply to everyone.
 
Conservative critics felt that the automobile decreased church attendance, increased sexual activity, and weakened family unity. A popular religious magazine of the day, the Independent, argued that it took away from even more important things. It argued, for example, that middle class men were prone to delay marriage in order to buy an automobile. It then argued that the automobile led to an augmented divorce rate, due to an increased stress rate over car payments. Others felt that couples delayed having children or even had fewer children, owing to the expense.

Social status.
The automobile signifies much more to many than simply a mode of transportation. Henri Lefebvre called the automobile "the epitome of possessions". In the early years, when the first automobiles were imported to America from France for the bourgeois and elite, the car served as a mark of distinction above all others. The automobile rapidly became a symbol of social status, and in some cases, a fashion item.  The automobile, more than almost any other possession, allowed people to flaunt wealth. Not only was  the ownership of an automobile demonstrative of a certain level of income and prestige (and still is, especially in poorer nations where the automobile isn't ubiquitous), it is also highly visible.

Recreation. 
The creation of good roads and dependable automobiles changed recreation and vacations. Before the automobile, resorts were predominantly found near the coast or a railroad. Once the automobile became abundant, resorts sprang up that were off the beaten path. Resorts appeared in scenic places, far away from the hectic life of the cities. In the United States, national parks became popular tourist attractions and developed designs with automobile travelers in mind.

Safety.
Automobile accidents caused many deaths and injuries, especially before automobile safety laws were implemented.  To this date, automobiles remain a major cause of accidental death and injury, not to mention emotional stress.

In comparison to pedestrians or users of mass transit, drivers of automobiles are not able to travel as quickly in inner-city urban cores. They are slightly less vulnerable to mugging, but are naturally vulnerable to crimes like carjacking, to torts like injuries sustained in car accidents, and to the inconvenience of vehicle breakdowns.   

The automobile expanded the role, abilities and efficiency of the emergency services such as the response to emergency calls for firefighters or paramedics. 

Political changes.

George Monbiot speculates that widespread car culture has shifted voter's preference to the right of the political spectrum. He thinks that car culture has contributed to an increase in individualism and fewer social interactions between members of different socioeconomic classes. The growth of the suburbs is also considered an important factor. Suburbs dwellers are more likely to vote conservative than city dwellers.

Since the early days of the automobile, automobile manufactures successfully lobbied consecutive governments to build public roads. Road building was sometimes also influenced by Keynesian-style political ideologies. In Europe, massive freeway building programs were initiated by a number of socialist governments after WW2, in an attempt to create jobs and make the automobile available to the working classes. From the 1970s onwards, promotion of the automobile increasingly became a trait of the conservative right. Margaret Thatcher talked of a "great car economy", and increased government spending on roads. Conservative parties often attempt to win votes by promising to defend motorists' rights.

Car-oriented convenience.

Many aspects of daily life in the First World industrialized countries reflect an impulse to make life convenient for car users.  

Without having to exit one's car, a resident of a typical large North American city may accomplish the following:

Buy gasoline at a gas station (in the few areas where full service is still available);
Have the car washed;
Obtain cash from an ATM;
Buy many different kinds of fast food;
Buy freshly prepared coffee or other similar beverages;
Deposit mail for delivery by the postal service;
Drop off apparel for dry cleaning;
Pick up and pay for prescription drugs at a pharmacy;
Return library books, videotapes, or almost any other small object that is regularly lent to the public;

Environmental changes.
Automobiles are a major source of the carbon dioxide that is causing global climate change. The total number of cars and light vehicles (exclusing heavy trucks) on the planet was about 600 million in 2006. This is increasing at the rate of about 50 million a year. The average car or light vehicle emits approximately 0.2 kilogramms of carbon dioxide per kilometre - in terms of volume, that is about 1 cubic metre of carbon dioxide for every 10 kilometres travelled. For a large part of its development, no consideration was given to concerns such as air pollution, destruction caused by road-building, and the massively increased consumption of limited natural resources, most notably petroleum and land. Certain of these issues are now starting to be addressed in some parts of the world, particularly in parts of the European Union, where there is much scope for tackling these problems. For example almost all cities in Europe were developed during the era when pedestrians and mass transit were more common, before the rise of the automobile - and are ideal for bicycles and other human powered transport.

The term Latin American revolutions refers to the various revolutions that took place during the early 1800s that resulted in the creation of a number of independent countries in the Latin American region. This is considered to be one of the most influential series of events in the history of the Western Hemisphere.

Conditions for revolution.
American Revolution.

The rebellion by the British colonies in North America from Great Britain was spurred by a number of taxes and Acts that the colonists had no say over. This infuriated colonists, and started the American Revolution, which gave inspiration to other revolutions in the Atlantic world, such as the French, Haitian, Latin American, and other unsuccessful revolutions. Colonists in North America were able to start a government of their own because of Enlightenment thinking, and because they were governing themselves on the state level for many years before the rebellion.

French Revolution.

This was a French peasant revolution against King Louis XVI.

Napoleonic Wars.

This was a series of wars fought between France (led by Napoleon Bonaparte) and alliances involving Britain, Prussia, Spain, Russia and Austria at different times, from 1799 to 1815.

Other factors.
Other factors included European Enlightenment thinking. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Latin America. Ideas about free trade and physiocrat doctrine were raised by the Enlightenment.

The revolutions.
Miguel Hidalgo led the successful independence movement of Mexico. Simón Bolívar helped in a number of revolutions in northern South America. A wealthy Creole officer, Bolívar impassioned his fellow South Americans to support him in fighting against the Spanish. Between 1817 and 1822, he won a series of victories in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. These countries were united in a new nation called Gran Colombia, which broke up in 1830 due to political differences and regional interests. Bolívar rejected all attempts to crown him king of the newly independent areas and worked until this death in 1830 for the cause of independence and republican government.

World Reaction.

France.
Portugal.
United States.

Acceptance or rejection of these new nations.
Europe.
During the 1800s, Latin American countries were faced by many challenges in developing their economy. Though they were politically independent from countries such as Spain and Portugal, many countries remained economically dependent on Europe. Latin American countries exported sugar, beef, copper and coffee to Europe in exchange for manufactured goods.

United States and Great Britain.
As a result of these successful revolts, United States President James Monroe asked Secretary of State John Quincy Adams to draft the Monroe Doctrine" It stated that the United States would not tolerate any European interference in the Western Hemisphere. This measure was taken in order to safeguard the newfound liberties revolutionaries such as Bolivar and Hidalgo fought for. Also, it was taken as a precautionary measure against the vast naval might of the United States' European contemporaries.

Great Britain had little in Latin America to lose by this time so they supported the United States' policies in the region so that the other European powers wouldn't be able to regain their strength there.

Within Latin America.
Simón Bolívar attempted to create an American-style government in Gran Colombia. Geographical barriers made this impossible, however, and Bolívar named himself Emperor Simón I. Latin America never did create an unified government because it had too many military rulers, and no civilian rulers. Because every ruler who came to power was from the military, Caudillos, there were countless revolutions, which never allowed Latin America to become united.

Resulting changes in international policies.
Increased interest in Africa.
Growing tensions in Europe.
Growth of U.S. political power.
Organization of American States.

The notion of closer hemispheric union in the American continent was first put forward by the Liberator Simón Bolívar who, at the 1826 Congress of Panama, proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. This meeting was attended by representatives of Gran Colombia (comprising the modern-day nations of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela), Peru, the United Provinces of Central America, and Mexico, but the grandly titled "Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation" was ultimately only ratified by Gran Colombia. Bolívar's dream soon foundered irretrievably with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of national rather than continental outlooks in the newly independent American republics.

The pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889 90, at the First International Conference of American States. Gathered together in Washington, D.C., 18 nations resolved to found the International Union of American Republics, served by a permanent secretariat called the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics (renamed the "International Commercial Bureau" at the Second International Conference in 1901 02). These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception to which today's OAS and its General Secretariat trace their origins.

<doc id="272596" title="Spanish Socialist Workers' Party" nonfiltered="976" processed="967" dbindex="450987">

The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, commonly abbreviated by its Spanish initials, PSOE (Partido Socialista Obrero Español), is a major party in Spain and the second oldest, exceeded only by the Partido Carlista, founded in 1833. It is a social-democratic party.    
   
It has had strong ties with the Unión General de Trabajadores, a Spanish trade union. For decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership. During the 1980s, though, UGT criticised the economic policies of the PSOE, even calling for a general strike on 14 December of 1988.   
   
Since the Spanish legislative election, 2004 on March 14, 2004 it is the largest party of government. It forms part of the Party of European Socialists and is a member of the Socialist International.   
    

 Ideology .   
The PSOE was founded with the purpose of representing the interests of the working class born from the Industrial Revolution with the declared objective of achieving socialism, and inspired by the revolutionary principles of Marxism. Nowadays, it is a social democratic party.

Early history.

The PSOE was founded on May 2, 1879 in Madrid by the historical Spanish workers' leader Pablo Iglesias. The first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people, on July 20 of that same year. Although the PSOE was rather weak during the late 1800s, its active participation in strikes from 1899 to 1902 and especially its electoral coalition with the main Republican parties led in 1910 to the election of Pablo Iglesias as the first Socialist representative in the Spanish Cortes.   
    
PSOE formed part of the Spanish government during the Second Spanish Republic and as part of the Spanish Popular Front, elected to government in 1936. During the Spanish Civil War, it was divided into three wings: a leftist revolutionary Marxist wing, led by Francisco Largo Caballero; a centrist, but violence-prone, led by Indalecio Prieto; and a reformist one, led by Julian Besteiro.   

The dictator Francisco Franco banned the PSOE in 1939, and it was legalised again in 1977. During Franco's rule it was persecuted, with many leaders, militants and supporters being imprisoned, assassinated, or exiled.

Modern history.   
Its 25th Congress was held in Toulouse in August 1972. In 1974 at its 26th Congress in Suresnes, Felipe González was elected Secretary General, replacing Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz. González was from the "reform" wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who hadn't fought the war.   
    
Llopis led a schism to form the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historic) (PSOE (h)).   
González showed intentions to move the party away from its Marxist and socialist background, turning the PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977 PSOE became the official opposition party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the Parliament. Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the 6 deputies of the Popular Socialist Party (Spain) agreed to merge with the party. 

In their 27th congress in May 1979 Gonzalez resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which González was re-elected and the party agreed to end Marxism within the party. European social democratic parties supported González' stand, and the German SPD granted them money. The party symbol was changed from the anvil with the book to the Social Democratic fist with a rose. In the referendum of 1978, PSOE supported the Spanish Constitution, which was approved. In the 1979 elections they gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party.        
On October 28 1982, the PSOE was victorious, with 48.3% of the vote (10,000,000 total). Felipe González became Prime Minister of Spain on December 2, a position he held until March 1996. In spite of its appearance as a party with a progressive economic program, the PSOE combined social reforms with a liberal and capitalist economic policy. In the face of this problem, the leftist base was disappointed to see their leaders rubbing elbows with the rich and powerful. One example would be the marriage between the Finance minister Miguel Boyer and the star of gossip magazines Isabel Preysler.    

  
Though the party had previously opposed NATO, after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation.   
The González administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and NATO, using the unofficial Atlantic Alliance terms.   
A symbol of this U-turn is Javier Solana who campaigned against NATO but ended years later as its Secretary General.   
    
PSOE Supported the United States in the First Gulf War (1991). The PSOE won 1986, 1989 and 1993 elections.   
    
Economic crisis, corruption scandals and state terrorism against the illegal Basque armed group ETA eroded the popularity of Felipe González, and in 1996, the PSOE lost the elections to the conservative Partido Popular (PP). Between 1996 and 2001 the PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. The party suffered a hard defeat in 2000 (34.7%).   
   
It has still remained as the ruling party in the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha and Asturias.   

 
In 2001, a new general secretary, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, was elected, renewing the party. Later, the PSOE won the municipal elections of 2003.    

On 13 November 2003 the PSOE won the regional election in Catalonia, through a pact with Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia, ERC, left-wing pro-independence) and Iniciativa per Catalunya (Initiative for Catalonia, ICV, left-wing).   
   
In 2004, the PSOE won the Spanish legislative elections with almost 43% of the votes, following the 11-M terrorist attacks, and maintained their lead in the elections to the European Parliament.   
-    
- In 2005, PSOE called for a Yes vote on the European Constitution. It has since legalised same-sex marriage, and has called for further integration into the EU.

Terms.   
 Baron: Unofficial term for the party's regional leaders. They can be very powerful, especially if they run an autonomous community. There have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate. Some barons are Pasqual Maragall (Catalonia), who didn't run for re-election in 2006; Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra (Extremadura), who has also announced that he will not run in his region's next elections; and Manuel Chaves (Andalusia). (Enrique Barón was a PSOE minister for Industry, the surname is a coincidence). The term baron is more colloquial than official, representing the great power than these persons have in the party.   ;
 Compañero ("companion"): A term of address among Socialists, similar to the English term comrade. After the social-democratization, it is out of vogue and used only during campaigns or by the most leftist socialists.   ;
 Currents: There have been several internal groups within PSOE, based on personal or ideological affinities. Some of them have ended with separation from the PSOE. The failed trial of primary elections for PSOE candidates was an attempt to conciliate currents. Examples of currents are "Guerristas" (followers of Alfonso Guerra), "Renovadores" (renewers, right-wing of the Party) or Izquierda Socialista (Socialist Left).

The Drava (German: Drau, Slovenian, Croatian and Italian: Drava, Hungarian: Dráva) is a river in southern Central Europe. It rises in South Tyrol, Italy and flows east through East Tyrol and Carinthia in Austria, into Slovenia (145 km), and then southeast, passing through Croatia and forming most of the border between Croatia and Hungary, before it joins the Danube near Osijek. It has a length of 725 km (450 mi).

The Drava flows through Lienz, Spittal an der Drau, Villach, Dieschitz and Ferlach in Austria, Dravograd, Vuzenica, Muta, Ru¨e, Maribor, Ptuj, and Ormo¸ in Slovenia, Vara¸din and Osijek in Croatia, and Barcs in Hungary. The Drava is navigable  for about 90 km from a avica in Croatia to its outfall.

The main tributaries of the Drava are: the Gail in Austria, the Mislinja and Dravinja in Slovenia, and the Bednja in Croatia from the left; and the Gurk in Austria, and the Mur (near Legrad) in Croatia from the right.

<doc id="161306" title="Sellmeier equation" nonfiltered="978" processed="969" dbindex="450989">


In optics, the Sellmeier equation is an empirical relationship between refractive index n and wavelength   for a particular transparent medium. The usual form of the equation for glasses is:



(definition used by Schott Glass)

where B1,2,3 and C1,2,3 are experimentally determined Sellmeier coefficients. These coefficients are usually quoted for   in micrometres. Note that this   is the vacuum wavelength; not that in the material itself, which is  /n( ).

The equation is used to determine the dispersion of light in a refracting medium. A different form of the equation is sometimes used for certain types of materials, e.g. crystals.

The equation was deduced in 1871 by W. Sellmeier, and was a development of the work of Augustin Cauchy on Cauchy's equation for modelling dispersion.

As an example, the coefficients for a common borosilicate crown glass known as BK7 are shown below:


 CoefficientValue 
 B11.03961212 
 B22.31792344x10 1 
 B31.01046945 
 C16.00069867x10 3  m2 
 C22.00179144x10 2  m2 
 C31.03560653x102  m2 


The Sellmeier coefficients for many common optical glasses can be found in the Schott Glass catalogue, or in the Ohara catalogue.

For common optical glasses, the refractive index calculated with the 3 terms Sellmeier equation only deviates from the actual refractive index by less than 5.10-6 for wavelengths ranging fron 365nm to 2.3µm   , which is of the order of the homogeneity of a glass sample . Additional terms are sometimes added to make the calculation even more precise. In its most general form, the Sellmeier equation is given as:

with each term of the sum representing an absorption resonance of strength Bi at a wavelength  Ci. For example, the coefficients for BK7 above correspond to two absorption resonances in the ultraviolet, and one in the mid-infrared region. Close to each absorption peak, the equation gives unphysical values of n=± , and in these wavelength regions a more precise model of dispersion such as Helmholtz's must be used.

At long wavelengths far from the absorption peaks, the value of n tends to:

where  r is the relative dielectric constant of the medium.

The Sellmeier equation can also be given in another form:

here the coefficient A is an approximation of the short-wavelength (e.g., ultraviolet) absorption contributions to the refractive index at longer wavelengths.

<doc id="7978" title="Data Encryption Standard" nonfiltered="979" processed="970" dbindex="450990">


The Data Encryption Standard (DES)  is a cipher (a method for encrypting information) selected as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1976, and which has subsequently enjoyed widespread use internationally. The algorithm was initially controversial, with classified design elements, a relatively short key length, and suspicions about a National Security Agency (NSA) backdoor. DES consequently came under intense academic scrutiny, and motivated the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis. 

DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications. This is chiefly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; DES keys have been broken in less than 24 hours. There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are theoretical attacks. In recent years, the cipher has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

In some documentation, a distinction is made between DES as a standard, and the algorithm, which is referred to as the DEA (the Data Encryption Algorithm). When spoken, "DES" is either spelled out (dee-ee-ess) or pronounced as a single syllable (dez or dess).

History of DES.
The origins of DES go back to the early 1970s. In 1972, after concluding a study on the US government's computer security needs, the US standards body NBS (National Bureau of Standards)   now named NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)   identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.  Accordingly, on 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions, however, turned out to be suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time, IBM submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable, a cipher developed during the period 1973 1974 based on an earlier algorithm, Horst Feistel's Lucifer cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, Walter Tuchman, Don Coppersmith, Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, Edna Grossman, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and Bryant Tuckerman.

NSA's involvement in the design.
On March 17, 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register. Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was some criticism from various parties, including from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, citing a shortened key length and the mysterious "S-boxes" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they -- but no-one else -- could easily read encrypted messages. Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, "We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different."  The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:
"In the development of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.";
However, it also found that
"NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended.";
Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, is quoted as saying, "We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!"

Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, a general method for breaking block ciphers.  The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique back in the 1970s. This was indeed the case--in 1994, Don Coppersmith published the original design criteria for the S-boxes.  According to Steven Levy, IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret.  Coppersmith explains, "that was because cryptanalysis can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security."  Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: "hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified.  They said do it.  So I did it".  Shamir himself commented, "I would say that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened."

The other criticism--that the key length was too short--was supported by the fact that the reason given by the NSA for reducing the key length from 64 bits to 56 was that the other 8 bits could serve as parity bits, which seemed somewhat specious. It was widely believed that NSA's decision was motivated by the possibility that they would be able to brute force attack a 56 bit key several years before the rest of the world would.

The algorithm as a standard.

Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976, and published on 15 January 1977 as FIPS PUB 46, authorized for use on all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1998 (FIPS-46-3), the latter prescribing "Triple DES" (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, following a public competition (see AES process). Even as of 2004, however, DES remains in widespread use.  On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but NIST has approved Triple DES through the year 2030 for sensitive government information. 

Another theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but it was a brute force attack in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of cryptanalysis are discussed in more detail later in the article.

The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers.  According to a NIST retrospective about DES, 
The DES can be said to have "jump started" the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is trying to "crack") the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer Bruce Schneier , "DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study." An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every symmetric key algorithm since has been compared.;

Chronology.


Replacement algorithms.
Concerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in software motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative block cipher designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s; for example RC5, Blowfish, IDEA, NewDES, SAFER, CAST5 and FEAL. Most of these designs kept the 64-bit block size of DES, and could act as a "drop-in" replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the USSR the GOST 28147-89 algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a 256-bit key, which was also used in Russia later. 

DES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use Triple DES (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES's patentees (see FIPS Pub 46-3); it involves applying DES three times with two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is DES-X, which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. GDES was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.

In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher: the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as a replacement. The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name Rijndael. Other finalists in the NIST AES competition included RC6, Serpent, MARS, and Twofish.

Description.

For brevity, the following description omits the exact transformations and permutations which specify the algorithm; for reference, the details can be found in DES supplementary material.;
DES is the archetypal block cipher   an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another ciphertext bitstring of the same length. In the case of DES, the block size is 64 bits. DES also uses a key to customize the transformation, so that decryption can only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking parity, and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective key length is 56 bits, and it is usually quoted as such.

Like other block ciphers, DES must be used in a mode of operation if applied to a message longer than 64 bits. FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES, including one for authentication . Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74 .

Overall structure.
The algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed rounds. There is also an initial and final permutation, termed IP and FP, which are inverses (IP "undoes" the action of FP, and vice versa).  IP and FP have almost no cryptographic significance, but were apparently included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s hardware. Before the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the Feistel scheme.

The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes   the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.

The red  symbol denotes the exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. The F-function scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are not swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.

The Feistel (F) function.
The F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:


 Expansion   the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the expansion permutation, denoted E in the diagram, by duplicating some of the bits. ;
 Key mixing   the result is combined with a subkey using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys   one for each round   are derived from the main key using the key schedule (described below).
 Substitution   after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the S-boxes, or substitution boxes. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a lookup table. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES   without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.
 Permutation   finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed permutation, the P-box. ;

The alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called "confusion and diffusion" respectively, a concept identified by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.

Key schedule.

Figure 3 illustrates the key schedule for encryption    the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by Permuted Choice 1 (PC-1)   the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as parity check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2)   24 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by "<<<" in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.

The key schedule for decryption is similar   it must generate the keys in the reverse order. Hence the rotations are to the right, rather than the left.

Security and cryptanalysis.
Although more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute force attack, require an unrealistic amount of known or chosen plaintext to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.

In spite of all the criticism and weaknesses of DES, there is no known example of anyone actually suffering monetary losses because of DES security limitations.

Brute force attack.
For any cipher, the most basic method of attack is brute force   trying every possible key in turn. The length of the key determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. It is known that the NSA encouraged, if not persuaded, IBM to reduce the key size from 128 to 64 bits, and from there to 56 bits; this is often taken as an indication that the NSA possessed enough computer power to break keys of this length even in the mid-1970s. 



In academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implemented, at least no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s.  In 1997, RSA Security sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest.  That contest was won by the DESCHALL Project, led by Rocke Verser, Matt Curtin, and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet.  The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see EFF DES cracker). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: "There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES." The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days' search; at about the same time at least one attorney from the US Justice Department was announcing that DES was unbreakable.



The only other confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine (Cost-Optimized Parallel COde Breaker) built more recently by teams of the Universities of Bochum and Kiel, both in Germany. Unlike the EFF machine, COPACOBANA consist of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. 120 of these FPGAs of type XILINX Spartan3-1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well. The figure shows a full-sized COPACOBANA. One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost factor. One machine can be built for approximately $10,000. The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an impressive example for the continuous improvement of digital hardware. Interestingly Moore s law predicts an improvement of about 32, since about 8 years have passed between the design of the two machines, which allows for about five doublings of computer power (or 5 reductions by 50% of the cost for doing the same computation).

Attacks faster than brute-force.
There are three attacks known that can break the full sixteen rounds of DES with less complexity than a brute-force search: differential cryptanalysis (DC), linear cryptanalysis (LC), and Davies' attack. However, the attacks are theoretical and are infeasible to mount in practice; these types of attack are sometimes termed certificational weaknesses.

 Differential cryptanalysis was discovered in the late 1980s by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir, although it was known earlier to both IBM and the NSA and kept secret. To break the full 16 rounds, differential cryptanalysis requires 247 chosen plaintexts. DES was designed to be resistant to DC.
 Linear cryptanalysis was discovered by Mitsuru Matsui, and needs 243 known plaintexts (Matsui, 1993); the method was implemented (Matsui, 1994), and was the first experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. There is no evidence that DES was tailored to be resistant to this type of attack. A generalisation of LC   multiple linear cryptanalysis   was suggested in 1994 (Kaliski and Robshaw), and was further refined by Biryukov et al (2004); their analysis suggests that multiple linear approximations could be used to reduce the data requirements of the attack by at least a factor of 4 (i.e. 241 instead of 243). A similar reduction in data complexity can be obtained in a chosen-plaintext variant of linear cryptanalysis (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000). Junod (2001) performed several experiments to determine the actual time complexity of linear cryptanalysis, and reported that it was somewhat faster than predicted, requiring time equivalent to 239 241 DES evaluations.
 Improved Davies' attack: while linear and differential cryptanalysis are general techniques and can be applied to a number of schemes, Davies' attack is a specialised technique for DES, first suggested by Donald Davies in the eighties, and improved by Biham and Biryukov (1997). The most powerful form of the attack requires 250 known plaintexts, has a computational complexity of 250, and has a 51% success rate.

There have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, i.e. versions of DES with fewer than sixteen rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a "security margin" the full version retains. Differential-linear cryptanalysis was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 215.8 known plaintexts and has a 229.2 time complexity (Biham et al, 2002).

Minor cryptanalytic properties.
DES exhibits the complementation property, namely that
;
where  is the bitwise complement of   denotes encryption with key    and  denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively. The complementation property means that the work for a brute force attack could be reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a chosen-plaintext assumption.

DES also has four so-called weak keys. Encryption (E) and decryption (D) under a weak key have the same effect (see involution):
 or equivalently, ;
There are also six pairs of semi-weak keys. Encryption with one of the pair of semiweak keys, , operates identically to decryption with the other, :
 or equivalently, ;
It is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation, either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly; the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible. The keys are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway, as they do not give an attack any advantage.

DES has also been proved not to be a group, or more precisely, the set  (for all possible keys ) under functional composition is not a group, nor "close" to being a group (Campbell and Wiener, 1992). This was an open question for some time, and if it had been the case, it would have been possible to break DES, and multiple encryption modes such as Triple DES would not increase the security.

It is known that the maximum cryptographic security of DES is limited to about 64 bits, even when independently choosing all round subkeys instead of deriving them from a key, which would otherwise permit a security of 768 bits.

Jessica Betts 1982 emerged in 2000 with a recording deal at Restless Records and a debut album titled You Can't Resist. The lead single "Get Up" has been picked up to be featured in the hit movie Big Mama and became a moderate hit. Even though, Jessica wasn't happy with the situation at the record company where they wanted her to be someone she says she wasn't. The recording deal was soon brought to end and Jessica had to think on a second coming. It happened in 2005 on Missy Elliott's UPN reality show, The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott. She went on to win the competition, being a favorite throughout despite having previously released an album before Missy's show. The show did not garner huge ratings. During a Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes concert in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, she performed the song "Killing Me Softly".

In a recent blurb from BET.com, Jessica is finishing the final touches on her yet-to-be-titled album, which features production from Timbaland, Vidal & Dre, Walter Millsap, Missy Elliott, 9th Wonder, Warryn Campbell, Brian Michael Cox, Mike City, Nisan Stewart, and The Avila Brothers (of Usher/Toni Braxton fame), set to be released in February 2007, with a single/video release in December 2006. The album also includes collaborations with American Idol winner Fantasia, Missy Elliott, Tweet, Karen Clark Sheard, Kelly Price and Faith Evans. The last three artists mentioned all join together with Jessica on the gospel-themed "Stand By Me", a track dedicated to Hurricane Katrina victims.

This list of pre-Colombian civilizations includes those civilizations and cultures of the Americas which flourished prior to the European colonization of the Americas. 

In particular, these pre-Colombian civilizations can be said to have established characteristics  such as permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, and complex societal hierarchies. 

Many of these civilizations had long ceased to function by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th - early 16th centuries), and are known only through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few (such as the Maya) had their own written records which can shed light on their development and history.  

Where they persist, the societies and cultures which gave rise to these civilizations may now be subtantively different in form to that of the original. However, many of these peoples and their  descendants still uphold various traditions and practices which relate back to these earlier times, even if combined with those more recently-adopted.

Za Kabuki (Japanese:     ), founded in 1976 at the Australian National University, is the longest running Kabuki troupe outside of Japan. Directed by Mr. Shun Ikeda of the ANU Japan Centre, with a cast and crew consisting mainly of ANU Japanese students, the troupe performs traditional Kabuki plays almost entirely in classical Japanese, with some English translation and ad-libs inserted to assist the mainly English-speaking audiences.

History.
The tradition of annual Japanese performances at the ANU began in 1976, with the first shows taking place in the walkway between the Sports & Recreation building and the Union building. During the 80s and 90s, productions became increasingly elaborate, with authentic makeup and costumes, original sets and musical accompaniment, hosted at a number of the theatre facilities around the ANU campus.

In 1999, Producer Suzy Styles led the Za Kabuki troupe on their first tour of Japan, with performances in Kyoto and Kobe. On September 11, 2001, a troupe from Kobe's Konan University returned the favor by performing at the ANU's Llewellyn Hall.

The 2006 production of Yukio Mishima's "Iwashiuri Koi no Hikiami", for the first time in Za Kabuki history, featured a 7-piece orchestra, also made up predominantly of ANU Japan Centre students. The orchestra played an original score, composed specifically for the play by Thomas Spencer Hartley.

Tay syndrome is a recessive hereditary disease characterised by trichothiodystrophy (sulfur-deficient brittle hair) with photosensitivity, ichthyosiform erythroderma (fish-like scales on skin), dystrophic (abnormal) finger and toe-nails, progeria-like faces (prematurely aged looking face), growth and mental retardation, infertility and variable other defects.

It is named after Dr. Tay Chong Hai, a Singaporean doctor who discovered and subsequently published a paper on it in 1971. Dr. Tay is the first doctor in South East Asia to be honoured by having a disease named after him. The Tay syndrome should not be confused with the Tay-Sachs disease.

Tay syndrome is synonymous with:

<doc id="2436304" title="Georges Querelle" nonfiltered="987" processed="978" dbindex="450998">
Georges "Jo" Querelle is the protagonist and antihero of Jean Genet's 1953 novel Querelle de Brest. He was portrayed by Brad Davis in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1982 movie adaptation of the novel.


A sailor on the cargo ship Le Vengeur, Querelle is also a thief, a prostitute, an opium smuggler, and a serial killer. While he technically kills for money, his real motive for murder is the sheer, liberating pleasure of it; he kills to feel alive. His view of crime as the highest form of creative expression   one of Genet's favorite themes   draws a close parallel to another literary thrill killer, Raskolnikov of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.

While he is sexually drawn to other men, he is more aroused by power than by people. Sex, for him, is an act of either domination or submission rather than pleasure or love, and so his partners are objects existing for the sole purpose of enacting his sadomasochistic fantasies of power and punishment. He has at least a passing interest in women; in one of the novel's main conflicts, he competes with his brother, Robert, for Madame Lysiane, Robert's mistress and the proprietess of a brothel they both frequent. Even then, however, Querelle's pursuit of her is completely self-serving, a ploy to get the best of his brother.

His mysterious, brooding persona and sexual ambiguity make him an object of fascination and attraction to everyone in his orbit, especially Madame Lysiane and Lieutenant Seblon, his closeted superior officer. While not completely understanding who or what he is, the people in his life find themselves inescapably drawn to him, often at their own peril.

He runs his smuggling racket out of Le Vengeur, enlisting one of his shipmates, Vic, as his accomplice. One night, when the ship is docked in the French port town of Brest, Querelle stabs Vic to death. The ship is delayed at the port as the police investigate, led by Mario, a predatory police captain who extorts sexual favors from the men he investigates before putting them in jail.

Desperate for a scapegoat, Querelle befriends Gilbert "Gil" Turko, a young man fleeing arrest for the murder of a man who propositioned him, with the intention of framing him for Vic's murder. Much to his surprise, however, he finds in Gil a kindred spirit whom he wants to "teach," both sexually and in the "art" of murder. He enlists Gil to help in mugging Seblon, confident that the lieutenant's infatuation with him will prevent him from going to the police. 

Querelle sleeps with Mario in an attempt to get him to back away from arresting him or Gil, but the captain is unmoved from turning him into yet another of his jailed conquests. Seeing no alternative, Querelle betrays Gil to Mario, adding to Gil's already dire situation the blame for a murder he didn't commit.

At the end of the novel, Querelle seduces Seblon, only to turn him over to the police the next day (homosexuality was illegal in France in the 1950s.) He leaves Brest the same day when Le Vengeur sets sail.

The 480 is a didactic future history novel of social commentary by William Lederer and Eugene Burdick (1965).

It created a well-crafted futures studies political campaign scenario that forecasts both our computer insecurity and meta-ethics challenges for social network analysis applications during the 21st century. 

The novel criticizes the socio-political effects on society at large from the use of computers by large corporations.  The 480 in the title is meant to echo IBM's very successful System/360 series of mainframe computers. Another interpretation of the 480 in the title is that this was the number of socio-economic classes that define the American electorate.

Lederer and Burdick collaborated on several other didactic novels, the most famous being The Ugly American (1958).

<doc id="10148" title="Ernst Kaltenbrunner" nonfiltered="989" processed="980" dbindex="451000">

Ernst Kaltenbrunner (October 4, 1903   October 16, 1946) was a senior Nazi official during World War II. He was executed for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Early life.
Born in Ried im Innkreis, Austria, he was the son of a lawyer. Educated at the State Realgymnasium in Linz and Graz University. He obtained a law degree in 1926. He worked as a lawyer briefly in Linz and Salzburg and from 1928 in Linz. He was a huge man, standing just over 6'6 tall.

The deep scars on his face were due to dueling in his student days.

Kaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party and the SS in Austria in 1932. He was the Gauredner (district speaker) and Rechtsberater (legal consultant) of the SS division VIII. In January 1934 Kaltenbrunner was briefly jailed by the Engelbert Dollfuss government with other National Socialists at the Kaisersteinbruch concentration camp. In 1934 he was jailed again on suspicion of High Treason in the assassination of Dollfuss. This accusation was dropped, but he was sentenced to six months for conspiracy. Also that year Kaltenbrunner married Elisabeth Eder, they had a son, Werner.

Kaltenbrunner rises to a major Nazi figure.
From mid-1935 Kaltenbrunner was the leader of the Austrian SS. He assisted in the Anschluss and Hitler promoted him to SS Brigadeführer on the day the Anschluss was completed. On September 11 1938 he was promoted to the rank of SS Gruppenführer (see Video of Kaltenbrunner in Vienna January 1939). He was also a member of the Reichstag from 1938. In April 1941 was promoted to Major General of the Police. 

On January 30 1943 Kaltenbrunner was appointed Chief of the RSHA, comprising both the Security Police (Sicherheitspolizei, or Sipo) and the SD, replacing Reinhard Heydrich, who had been assassinated in June 1942. Kaltenbrunner held this position until the end of the war. 

Toward the end of the war, Kaltenbrunner's power increased greatly, especially after the attack on Hitler of July 20 1944. He gained direct access to Hitler. It was said that even Heinrich Himmler feared him, and it was rumoured that he was responsible for Adolf Eichmann's failure to attain the rank of SS-Colonel. 

Following Himmler's appointment as Minister of the Interior in August 1943, Kaltenbrunner sent him a letter wherein he argued that Himmler's new powers must be used to reverse the party cadre organisation's annexation of the civil service and the government apparatus. However he soon changed course and assiduously courted Martin Bormann much to Himmler's resentment. His closeness to Bormann further strengthened his position vis-a-vis Himmler and indeed the rest of the SS.

On December 9 1944 he was awarded the Knight's Cross. By then his full title was SS Obergruppenführer and General of the Police Dr. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Chief of the Security Police and the SD. In addition he held the Golden Insignia of Honor and the Blutorden.

Nuremberg Trials.

At the Nuremberg Trials he was charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war-crimes and crimes against humanity. The most notable witness in this trial was Rudolf Hoess, the camp commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp.

His close control over the RSHA meant that direct knowledge of and responsibility for the following crimes was ascribed to him: 

Mass murders of civilians of occupied countries by Einsatzgruppen. ;
Screening of prisoner of war camps and executing racial and political undesirables. ;
The taking of recaptured prisoners of war to concentration camps, where in some cases they were executed. ;
Establishing concentration camps and committing racial and political undesirables to concentration and annihilation camps for slave labor and mass murder. ;
Deportation of citizens of occupied countries for forced labor and disciplining of forced labor. ;
The execution of captured commandos and paratroopers and protection of civilians who lynched Allied fliers. ;
The taking of civilians of occupied countries to Germany for secret trial and punishment. ;
Punishment of citizens of occupied territories under special criminal procedure and by summary methods. ;
The execution and confinement of people in concentration camps for crimes allegedly committed by their relatives. ;
Seizure and spoliation of public and private property. ;
Murder of prisoners in SIPO and SD prisons. ;
Persecution of Jews. ;
Persecution of the churches. ;

During the trial his lawyer attempted to bring out the worst in direct examination but only served to make things worse for him. He told his guards to relay to the prosecution that thanks were in order "for bringing him such a stupid attorney."  He also denied his signed name so many times that his own attorneys referred to him as (Der Mann ohne Unterschrift) "the man without a signature."

He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. He was executed at around 1.40 a.m. on October 16, 1946; his last words were: 

I have loved my German people and my fatherland with a warm heart.  I have done my duty by the laws of my people and I am sorry this time my people were led by men who were not soldiers and that crimes were committed of which I had no knowledge.  Germany, good luck.

Personal Life.
In 1934 Kaltenbrunner married Elisabeth Eder (b. 1908) and they had three children. In addition, he had twins (b. 1945) with his long-time mistress Gisela Gräfin von Westarp (née Wolf). All of his children survived the war.

Miscellaneous.
In the twelve episode Russian television series, Seventeen Moments of Spring, Ernst Kaltenbrunner plays an important role and he is portrayed by Mikhail Zharkovsky.
In the book Colonization: Down to Earth Harry Turtledove creates an alternative history where Kaltenbrunner is the successor of Himmler as the third Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor of the Greater German Reich and triggers a war between Nazi Germany and aliens, a war that results in the destruction of the Reich.
 He is represented in the landmark NBC docu-drama mini-series, Holocaust.;
A character in the movie The Return of the Living Dead is named "Ernie Kaltenbrunner".

Yang Lin (  ) is a character in the epic Chinese tale Water Margin.

Yang Lin was from Zhangdefu. He had a round head, large ears, straight nose and squarish mouth, beautiful eyes and a narrow waist with broad shoulders. He was often armed with an iron spear and was nicknamed 'Multi-coloured leopard' (   ).

He became an outlaw and got to know Gongsun Sheng by chance. Once, Dai Zong went to visit Gongsun Sheng and met Yang Lin. They travelled together and passed by Yinma River. There, Dai Zong managed to persuade the bandits at Yinma River (Pei Xuan, Deng Fei and Meng Kang) to join the Liangshan band.

When the Liangshan heroes attacked the Zhu Family Village, Yang Lin volunteered to sneak inside the village and act as a spy. He disguised himself as a priest and started marking out the roads, but the enemy saw through his disguise and caught him. Later, after the heroes had conquered the village, then Yang Lin was released.

Yang Lin became one of the leaders of the Liangshan calvary and 72 Earthly Warriors. After Song Jiang had obtained amnesty from the emperor, Yang Lin followed the heroes on their campaigns against the Liao Tartars and southern rebels. During the Fang La campaign, Yang Lin followed Mu Hong and sneaked into Runzhou. They acted as spies from within and helped the Liangshan heroes conquer Runzhou, making great contributions. After the conquest of Hangzhou, Yang Lin fell ill and could not move on, so he remained in Hangzhou till he recovered.

After Fang La had been defeated, Yang Lin refused to take up any official post despite his contributions. He and Pei Xuan returned to Yinma River after that.

Panchamrita generally refers to a concoction used in Hindu worship services.  It is a Sanskrit word, a combination of two words - Panch, meaning five and Amrita, meaning nectar.  As its name implies, it is made of five ingredients, usually, milk, ghee, curd, honey, and jaggery.

Each of the 'nectars' has an origin in Hindu tradition. The milk is that of Kamadhenu (the wish-fulfilling heavenly cow), the curd represents the white, smooth and cool lustre of the moon, the ghee is the food of the gods themselves with a long Vedic past, honey - the extract of all herbs, is the essence of life with herbal healing powers and jaggery - the extract of sugarcane, a representation and the epitome of sweetness.

Panchamrita is offered to gods and distributed to devotees on special days.

<doc id="150423" title="Bifocals" nonfiltered="992" processed="983" dbindex="451003">

Bifocals are eyeglasses that have corrective lenses containing two different optical powers.  They are most commonly prescribed for people with presbyopia, and who also require a distance correction for myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism.  

Benjamin Franklin had become disgusted having to change eyeglasses whenever he read the paper. Using an old, weaker prescription for reading, it suddenly struck him that if he had his old spectacles and new spectacles cut horizontally in half, married the weaker lens half in the bottom of the frame and the stronger half in the top, he could read or look comfortably across the room merely by shifting his eyes up or down.

Proudly he wrote to his optometrist -- then known as opticians -- and described the procedure. Later he took his two pairs of glasses, had the work completed, and history, that Franklin was so good at making, was made once more.

So, the originals were designed with the lenses for close viewing in the lower half of the frame and the distance viewing lenses on the upper. Until a few generations ago, the lenses were still cut in half and combined together in the rim of the frame.

Later, the process involved the cementing of a bifocal segment onto a larger lens, but now most bifocals are made by molding a small reading segment into the lens. The correct term for the segment is "segment", but the correct term for the prescription of the segment is known as the "add" power, or "add" for short.

Bifocal lenses are available with the reading segments in a variety of shapes and widths.  The most popular is the flat-top (a.k.a. straight-top or D-segment), 28 mm wide.

With the advent of computers, bifocal users have experienced some problems.  Although most printed reading materials are easily viewed with bifocals, computer monitors are generally placed directly in front of users, but still close enough to require corrective lenses, requiring bifocal wearers to tilt their heads up to view the screen. Naturally this trouble is easily solved by the use of trifocal lenses.

But a next generation bifocal is being developed by Guoqiang Li and Nasser Peyghambarian at the University of Arizona. Instead of the old double lenses, the new switchable lens uses the whole aperture for one vision task and hence the field of view is increased. The lens is based on diffractive optics principle. It has an ultrathin liquid crystal layer sandwiched between the two glass substrates coated with transparent conductive thin film. One substrate consists of photolithographically patterned electrodes. When electrical voltages are applied to the patterned electrodes, the director of the liquid crystal molecules rotate and the effective refractive index changes, varying the focusing power of the lens.

Antonius ("Anton") Johannes Geesink (born April 6, 1934 in Utrecht) is a Dutch 10th dan judoka. He is a 3 time World champion (1961, 1964 and 1965) and Olympic Gold Medalist(1964).  He was 6' 7" tall and at one time weighed 320 pounds.

Judo career.

Geesink first participated in the European Championships in 1951, and placed second in his category. The following year, he won his first European title. Until 1967, 20 more European titles would follow.

At the 1961 World Championships, Geesink became World Champion in the open class, defeating the Japanese, who had won all World Championship titles up to that point. 

Judo debuted as an official sport at the 1964 Summer Olympics, which were held in the sports home country, Japan. Although Japan dominated 3 of the 4 weight divisions (light,middle and heavy), Anton Geesink won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.

After winning the 1965 World Championships and a last European title in 1967, Geesink quit competitive judo. 

Anton Geesink is the only living 10th dan grade kodansha recognized by the IJF. There are three 10th dan kodanshas recognized by Kodokan: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe and Yoshimi Osawa.

Professional Wrestling Career.

In October 1973, All Japan Pro-Wrestling owner Giant Baba recruited Anton Geesink to join AJPW.  Baba sent him to Amarillo, TX and Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk trained him for a month. He worked for All Japan from 1973 to 1978, as a popular part-timer.

Notable opponents included Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon, Dick Murdoch, Dory Funk Jr., Bob Remus (Sgt. Slaughter), Jumbo Tsuruta.

International Olympic Committee Career.

In 1987, he became a member of the board of the Dutch National Olympic Committee, and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Geesink was among the IOC members suspected of accepting bribes during the scandal surrounding the election of Salt Lake City as the host of the 2002 Winter Olympics. The IOC considered the situation not serious enough for expulsion, and issued a warning to Geesink.

Trivia.

When he was twelve years old, Geesink was beaten up by Rijk de Gooyer, because he was caught stealing bread from De Gooyers bakery-cart. Nowadays, both men are Dutch celebrities: Geesink for his judo career, and De Gooyer is a well known actor in The Netherlands. Both come from the Dutch city of Utrecht.

Collin's Barracks is a military barracks on the north side of Cork in Ireland. 

Originally erected between 1801 and 1806 (by Abraham Hargrave) and named simply The Barracks, the complex commands a prominent position on the hills overlooking the city and the River Lee.

The barracks were extended in 1849 and renamed to Victoria Barracks, to celebrate a visit by Queen Victoria.

Housing British forces in the city for more than one hundred years, the barracks were handed over by the British Government to Commandant Sean Murray of the Army of the Irish Free State in 1922, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty (which marked the end of the Irish War of Independence).

The barracks were quickly renamed for Michael Collins, the first commander-in-chief of the Free State, and a native of Cork.

A garrison for the Southern Command of the Irish Army since then, the complex was visited by US President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

<doc id="2143113" title="Dave Hickson" nonfiltered="1002" processed="993" dbindex="451013">
Dave Hickson (born 30 October 1929 in Ellesmere Port) was a football player for Everton, Aston Villa, Huddersfield Town, Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers.

Hickson signed for Everton in 1948 from non-league Ellesmere Port but he then had to serve in the Army for three years, were he played in the Cheshire Army Cadets team.  There he was coached by 'Dixie' Dean. He made his league debut for Everton in 1951.  He was a 'physical' centre forward and his complete commitment won him adulation.  Although he was good 'in the air', he was also quite skillful on the ground and possessed a powerful shot.  

Hickson's reputation was confirmed in an epic 5th round FA Cup tie in 1953 against Manchester United when he had typically put his head where there were flailing boots and he was carried off with a serious gash.  Nevertheless he returned to score the winner and played the rest of the match while losing blood copiously. Hickson also scored the winner in the following 6th round tie.

Hickson scored 25 goals in the 1953-54 season and so made a major contribution to Everton's promotion from Division Two. However, he left Everton in 1955 to join Aston Villa for £17,500.  Later he moved briefly to Huddersfield Town.  In 1957 he came back to Everton, though not as successfully.  Even so there was much sadness among Everton's fans when he joined Liverpool in 1959.  Later he played 45 games for Tranmere Rovers.

Hickson made 243 appearances and scored 111 goals for Everton and in the process became to the club.  He is famous for saying during an interview: "I would have died for Everton, I would have broke every other bone in my body for any other club, that's how I look at it, you know, if it was that much I would have died for this club." Today Hickson is still with Everton as a guide on the tours of the club's ground, Goodison Park.

Los Alamitos Creek or Alamitos Creek is a creek in San Jose, California, USA.  It is located in Almaden Valley and begins at Almaden Lake.  It is managed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District.  The creek flows in a generally northwesterly direction as it ambles along the northeast side of the Almaden Valley.  Its environment has some relatively undisturbed areas and considerable lengths of suburban residential character.

The Los Alamitos Creek Trail or Alamitos Creek Trail is a paved four mile long trail by the creek that crosses Almaden Expressway and Camden Avenue. 

History.
The Alamitos Creek banks were inhabited by Native American tribes thousands of years ago and up until the time of Spanish exploration.  Evidence of middens and traces of that hunter-gatherer civilisation has been recorded from archeological excavations and surface finds.  In the 1940s and 1950s, rapid residential development expanded into this portion of the Almaden Valley including building which encroached into the 100-year floodplain.  The Santa Clara Valley Water District began studying this watershed with emphasis upon flood control functions, and made some minor streambed alterations such as energy dissipators.  In 1976 the District developed a comprehensive flood control plan and retained Earth Metrics Inc. to prepare an independent Environmental Impact Report.  The resulting study developed the first comprehensive data base of biology, water quality, geology and cultural resources information for Alamitos Creek.  In 1989 the city of San Jose undertook an analysis to create a creekside trail from Almaden Quicksilver County Park to a location along Alamitos Creek about .6 mile below the confluence with Calero Creek.

Ecology.
In the downstream rocky streambed reaches of the creek there are a variety of birds commonly observed including mallard, Black Phoebe, Common Merganser, Red-shouldered Hawk, Snowy Egret, Belted Kingfisher, Great Blue Heron and Black-crowned Night-Heron.  There are a few mammals on the lower reaches such as raccoon.  Vegetation includes upland tree species such as coast live oak and California bay laurel; understory growth such as coyote brush, toyon and poison oak; and riparian vegatation such as red willow and wild blackberry.

In the extreme downstream reaches Rufous-crowned Sparrow, California Thrasher and American Kestrel can be observed on chaparral slopes.  In the oak woodlands along the creek, Acorn Woodpecker, California Quail, Anna's Hummingbird, Scrub Jay, Oak Titmouse, Bushtit, Bewick's Wren, and Spotted Towhee can be found.

Maine Guides are individuals certified to accompany travelers on a number of outdoor activities in the wilderness of the State of Maine, in the U.S.A.  

 History .

On March 19, 1897, The Maine legislature passed a bill requiring hunting guides to register with the state. Maine registered 1316 guides in that first year.  

The first Registered Maine Guide was a woman, Cornilia Thurza Crosby, or "Fly Rod", as she was popularly known. In addition to being its first licensed guide, she promoted Maine's outdoor sports at shows in metropolitan areas, and wrote a popular column that appeared in many newspapers around the country. Her efforts helped to attract thousands of would-be outdoorsmen--and women--to the woods and streams of Maine.

 What is a Maine Guide? .

Maine Guides are licensed and registered with the State of Maine.  "Guide" means any person who receives any form of remuneration for services in accompanying or assisting any person in the fields, forests or on the waters or ice within the jurisdiction of the State while hunting, fishing, trapping, boating, snowmobiling or camping at a primitive camping area.

 Becoming a Maine Guide .

Maine Guides are licensed in one or more specialized classifications:  Hunting, Inland Fishing, Recreational, Sea-Kayaking, and Tide Water Fishing.Being licensed in a specialized classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide one or more specific types of activity as follows:

Specialized Hunting classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide hunting and trapping activities, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with those hunting and trapping activities.

Specialized Fishing classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide fishing activities, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with those fishing activities on inland waters.

Specialized Recreational classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide boating, snowmobiling and camping activities.

Specialized Sea- Kayaking classification means that a person ha met the qualifications to guide sea-kayaking activities on the State's territorial seas and tributaries of the State up to the head of tide and out to the three mile limit, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with those sea-kayaking activities.  ;

Specialized Tide-Water Fishing classification means that a person has met the qualifications to guide sport fishing activities on the State's territorial seas and tributaries of the State up to the head of tide out to the three mile limit, including overnight camping trips in conjunction with those tide-water fishing activities.

Registered Maine Guides have satisfactorily completed a written examination in each license classification for which he/she applies. In addition all Maine Guides have passed an oral examination.  The oral exam is overseen by a panel of State of Maine Game Wardens and experienced Maine Guides. The oral exam includes: map and compass, lost person scenarios, navigation, survival, as well as questions to ensure the professional knowledge in the Guide's area of specialization.

 Master Maine Guide .

Master certification means that a person has acquired experience in a specialized classification that exceeds the minimum requirements necessary to be licensed as a guide in that classification.

To become a Master Maine Guide, a guide must have been working as a guide for ten years, and have had at least five years professional experience in their specialized classification. It should be noted that the process of obtaining a License as a Registered Maine Guide is the most difficult in the country, which is why Maine Guides are held in such high regard.

Batuque was a Brazilian game played in Bahia in the early part of the twentieth century but now extinct.  A similar game, pernada, was popular in Rio de Janeiro about the same time.  Players stand in a circle; one player stands in the center in a defensive position, and another moves around him, suddenly attacking.  The attacking player tries to throw the defending player to the ground with blows from his legs.  Mestre Bimba's father was a champion of batuque, and research seems to indicate that Mestre Bimba incorporated some techniques into his Capoeira Regional courses.  

For further details, see Capoeira: Roots of the Dance-Fight-Game, by Nestor Capoeira, ISBN 1-55643-404-9.

<doc id="3740698" title="Direct numerical simulation" nonfiltered="1008" processed="999" dbindex="451019">
A direct numerical simulation (DNS) is a simulation in computational fluid dynamics in which the Navier-Stokes equations are numerically solved without any turbulence model. This means that the whole range of spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence must be resolved.
All the spatial scales of the turbulence must be resolved in the computational mesh, from the smallest dissipative scales (Kolmogorov scales), up to the integral scale L, associated with the motions containing most of the kinetic energy. The Kolmogorov scale,, is given by



where   is the kinematic viscosity and   is the rate of kinetic energy dissipation. On the other hand, the integral scale depends usually on the spatial scale of the boundary conditions. 

To satisfy these resolution requirements, the number N of points along a given mesh direction with increments h, must be

,

so that the integral scale is contained within the computational domain, and also

,

so that the Kolmogorov scale can be resolved.

Since 

,

where u is the root mean square (RMS) of the velocity, the previous relations imply that a three-dimensional DNS requires a number of mesh points  satisfying

 

where Re is the turbulent Reynolds number

.

Hence, the memory storage requirement in a DNS grows very fast with the Reynolds number. In addition, given the very large memory necessary, the integration of the solution in time must be done by an explicit method. This means that in order to be accurate, the integration must be done with a time step,  t, small enough such that a fluid particle moves only a fraction of the mesh spacing h in each step. That is,



(C is here the Courant number). 

The total time interval simulated is generally proportional to the turbulence time scale  given by

.

Combining these relations, and the fact that h must be of the order of , the number of time-integration steps must be proportional to . By other hand, from the definitions for Re,   and L given above, it follows that 

,

and consequently, the number of time steps grows also as a power law of the Reynolds number.

One can estimate that the number of floating-point operations required to complete the simulation is proportional to the number of mesh points and the number of time steps, and in conclusion, the number of operations grows as .

Therefore, the computational cost of DNS is very high, even at low Reynolds numbers. For the Reynolds numbers encountered in most industrial applications, the computational resources required by a DNS would exceed the capacity of the most powerful computer currently available. However, direct numerical simulation is a useful tool in fundamental research in turbulence. Using DNS it is possible to perform "numerical experiments", and extract from them information difficult or impossible to obtain in the laboratory, allowing a better understanding of the physics of turbulence. Also, direct numerical simulations are useful in the development of turbulence models for practical applications, such as sub-grid scale models for Large eddy simulation (LES) and models for methods that solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). This is done by means of "a priori" tests, in which the input data for the model is taken from a DNS simulation, or by "a posteriori" tests, in which the results produced by the model are compared with those obtained by DNS. The biggest DNS in the world, up to this date, used  mesh points. It was carried out in the Japanese Earth Simulator supercomputer in 2002.

The Martin JRM Mars was the largest flying boat ever to enter production. The U.S. Navy contracted the development of the XPB2M-1 Mars in 1938 as a flying dreadnought for ocean patrol. 

Navy service.

The Martin Company effectively scaled up their successful PBM Mariner patrol bomber design to produce the prototype XPB2M-1 Mars. After flight tests with the XPB2M between 1941 and 1943, she was passed on to the Navy. The original patrol bomber concept was considered obsolete by this time, and the Mars was converted into a transport aircraft designated the XPB2M-1R. The Navy was satisfied with the performance, and ordered 20 of the modified JRM-1 Mars. The first, named Hawaii Mars, was delivered in June 1945, but the with the end of World War II the Navy scaled back their order to just 5 more boats. Though the original Hawaii Mars was lost in an accident on Chesapeake Bay, the other 5 Mars were built  with the last delivered in 1947.

Named the Marianas Mars, Philippine Mars, Marshall Mars, Caroline Mars, and a second Hawaii Mars, the 5 production Mars aircraft entered service ferrying cargo to Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. On May 5, 1950, the Marshall Mars was lost near Hawaii when an engine fire consumed the airplane after her crew had evacuated. The remaining "Big Four" flew record amounts of cargo on the San Francisco-Honolulu route efficiently until 1956, when they were parked at NAS Alameda.

Civilian use.


In 1959, the remaining Mars were sold for scrap. Dan McIvor, who represented a consortium of British Columbia lumber companies, recognized their potential value as water bombers and had them converted. A company called Flying Tankers Inc. was formed, and purchased the "Big Four" for aerial firefighting. The Marianas Mars crashed near Northwest Bay, British Columbia on June 23, 1961 during firefighting operations; all four crewmembers were lost. Just over a year later, on October 12, 1962, the Caroline Mars was destroyed by Typhoon Freda while parked onshore. The remaining Hawaii Mars and Philippine Mars had their conversions to water bombers accelerated and entered service in 1963.

The two surviving tankers are still operated by Flying Tankers Inc., now a subsidiary of TimberWest Forest Ltd., and are based at Sproat Lake near Port Alberni, British Columbia. When converted, the original powerplants were replaced with four Wright R-3350-24WA Cyclone engines of 2500 hp (1860 kW) each. The aircraft can carry up to 7,200 US gal (27,250 litres) of water, enough to cover an area of 4 acres (16,000 m²). They are used to fight fires along the coast of British Columbia, and even sometimes in the interior.  They also make appearances at local airshows, demonstrating their water-dropping ability. Flying Tankers Inc. also flies the water bombers to other hotspots around the world if a need develops, such as in August of 2003 when a large forest fire threatened the city of Kelowna, British Columbia.  On November 10, 2006, TimberWest Forest Ltd. announced that they are looking for buyers of the Mars.  A condition of this sale is that the purchasers will donate one back to Port Alberni when they are retired as a historical attraction.  The Maryland Aviation Museum and British Columbia Aviation Council have initiated a joint effort to preserve the aircraft, one in Maryland and the other at their current location in Canada.

Perilla ketone is a natural terpenoid that consists of a furan ring with a six-carbon side chain containing a ketone functional group.  It is a colorless oil that is sensitive to oxygen, becoming colored upon standing.

Perilla ketone is present in the leaves and seeds of purple mint (Perilla frutescens), which is toxic to some animals.  When cattle and horses consume purple mint when grazing in fields in which it grows, the perilla ketone causes pulmonary edema leading to a condition sometimes called perilla mint toxicosis.

<doc id="1303647" title="Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee" nonfiltered="1018" processed="1009" dbindex="451029">


Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee is an 18th century Chinese detective novel, Dee Goong An (   , lit. "Cases of Judge Dee"). It is loosely based on the adventures of Judge Dee (Ti Jen-chieh or Di Renjie), a magistrate and statesman of the Tang court, who lived roughly 630 700.

The Dee Goong An was translated by Robert van Gulik into English and used as the basis for his own series of detective novels about Judge Dee after he came across it in a secondhand bookshop in Tokyo. The author wrote that 

This translation is chiefly a product of the Pacific War years, 1941-1945, when constant travel on various war duties made other more complicated Sinological research impossible.


In the preface, van Gulik describes some of the problems (as he saw it) with traditional Chinese murder mysteries. First, the criminal is introduced at the very start of the story and his crime and reasons are carefully explained, so removing any mystery from the story at the start. Second, the stories always have a supernatural element with ghosts telling people about their death and even accusing the criminal. Third, the stories were filled with digressions into philosophy, the complete text of official documents, and much more, making for very long books. Fourth, Chinese novels tended to have a huge cast of characters (200 or more) and these characters are all described as to their relation to the various main actors in the story. Lastly, the Chinese writers spent little time on the details of how the crime was committed and great deal of time on describing the torture of the criminals, even going on into their further torments in one of the various hells for the damned.  

Van Gulik then goes on to say 
This novel Dee Goong An is offered here in a complete translation. Possibly it would have had a wider appeal if it had been entirely re-written in a form more familiar to our readers.

This is exactly what Robert van Gulik did over the next 20 years, as he created his Judge Dee series. For the books based on the semi-fictional detective Judge Dee see: Judge Dee.

The original Chinese novel contains cultural elements from the Ming Dynasty (1368 1644) rather than Tang Dynasty China, which may have been done deliberately or from ignorance about Tang-era China.

The book features nine drawings, three copies from old Chinese art, and six illustrations by the author.

Plot introduction.
There are three cases in this book. The first might be called "The Double Murder at Dawn". The case describes the hazardous life of the traveling silk merchant and the murder which is committed to gain wealth.

The second is The Strange Corpse which takes place in a small village, a crime of passion which proves hard to solve. The criminal is a very determined woman.

The third case The Poisoned Bride is the daughter of a local scholar who marries the son of the former administrator of the district and the killer is a man studying for the imperial exams.

All three cases are solved by Judge Dee, the district magistrate - Detective, prosecutor, judge, and jury all wrapped up into one person.

Albersdorf is a village in the district of Dithmarschen, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is situated near the Kiel Canal, approx. 14 km southeast of Heide. The place was first mentioned in 1281 under the name Aluerdesdorpe, meaning "village of the old custodian." Albersdorf is the seat of an Amt KLG, bearing the same name, in which ten municipalities around Albersdorf are organized.


 Physical geography .
There are many tumuli from the Neolithic and the Bronze Age in this region. It is situated in the east of the Dithmarschen, close to the Kiel Canal. The area is called a geest a sandy heathland with numerous hills and forrests. Albersdorf is a spa town visited for its pure air. It is therefore a popular touristic centre of the Dithmarschen. 

 Economy .
The biggest employer in Albersdorf is the Bundeswehr with more than 780 jobs. However, in November 2004 it was published that the army base would be closed in the future.


 Sites of interest .

The Archeologic-Ecological Center tries to recreate the cultural landscape of the Neolithic 5,000 years ago, on the area of 40,000 m². The aim is to create a pasture, settled by the first farmers. In 1999 the center has opened a stone age village in which visitors are shown the technics of that time. In the town centre there is the spa park with an open air stage for 2,000 people.

In Albersdorf there is the oldest folk high school on German soil, which is still open today. At the time it was founded, Holstein was under Danish administration. In the rest of Germany, folk high schools were not introduced until the formation of the Weimar Republic in 1919.

 Notable events .

For more than a century now, Albersdorf celebrates the Pfingstvolksfest (pentecost festival), visited by several thousand people each year.

Julie Teeger is a fictional character on the USA Network show Monk, played by Emmy Clarke. She is the daughter of Adrian Monk's assistant, Natalie. As of the season four episode "Mr. Monk Goes to a Fashion Show," she is 13 years old, and revealed to be in high school in "Mr. Monk and the big game".

Julie was introduced to the show during the third season (episode 10, "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring") where she bonded with Monk after he rescued her pet fish. Since then, Julie has appeared in several episodes of the show, usually in minor roles. In "Mr. Monk Goes to a Fashion Show," Julian Hodge (Malcolm McDowell) invites Julie to participate in a fashion show.  Natalie forbids it, partly because Julian criticized her fashion sense, and Julie runs away to be in the show.

Natalie and Julie fill the gap left when Sharona left Monk and went with her son, Benjy, to remarry her ex-husband.

Råne

Foreldrenes, miljøets og gamle damers verste mareritt. Råning er noe ofte unge mennesker med tøff bil og litt for mye penger til bensin driver med i fritiden. De setter seg i bilen, kjører frem og tilbake et titalls ganger og håper på at noen legger merke til dem.  Av og til sitter eller ligger noen på panseret mens bilen kjører.

Råning skjer ofte i miljøer hvor det er mange ungdommer med tøffe biler. Det er ofte såkalte "råneruter". Det er ganske selvsagt hva det betyr, nemlig at det er en rute hvor rånerene skal kjøre. 

Det finnes klart rånere som driver og kjører uansvarlig, men det må du ikke forbinde med ordet "råne". De fleste som råner kjører ganske ansvarlig, dog med litt for høyt turtall. Men det er bare moro, syns rånerne selv.

Harder Than You is the debut album from rap, metal, and funk pioneers 24-7 Spyz. The album contains elements of several genres and is the band's heaviest album. The group flirts with polka on "Tango Skin Polka," instrospective political reggae on "Ballots Not Bullets," and speed metal with "Spill My Guts." 

The band made a video for MTV with their cover of Kool and the Gang's "Jungle Boogie." The song was also remixed into a dance version with extended electronic instrumental passages and was popular on the club circuit.

The album is widely regarded as a pioneering effort in the fusion of hip hop and heavy metal that would take place in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Like many 24-7 Spyz albums, the recording is out of print.

The Penguin versions of the works of D. H. Lawrence reproduce the scholarly editions originally published by Cambridge University Press without some of the specialist editorial apparatus. They are based on the most accurate versions of the texts, and include a critical essay of introduction; bibliography of criticism; explanatory notes; alternative and missing chapters; and glossaries of dialect terms where required. The titles are widely available in a cheap paperback format.

Penguin has a long association with the publication of Lawrence's work, most notably the first unexpurgated paperback edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover that led to a prosecution for obscenity in the early 1960s.

Shona McIsaac (born 3 April 1960, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland) is a British politician, and since 1997, she has been the Labour Member of Parliament for the Lincolnshire constituency of Cleethorpes.

Early life.

She studied Geography at St. Aidan's College the University of Durham and graduated in 1981.

McIsaac wrote for magazines and was elected to the London Borough of Wandsworth.

MP for Cleethorpes.

McIsaac was selected for Cleethorpes from an all-women shortlist and attracted a great deal of local press attention in the run-up to the 1997 general election.

Typical of many marginal constituencies that year, Cleethorpes had a large amount of support from the central Labour Party including visits by John Prescott and a high-profile, high-visibility poster campaign.

During the various debates between the candidates, McIsaac's relaxed, conciliatory style was in stark contrast to that of her election-hardened Conservative Party opponent Michael Brown, the outgoing MP for the predecessor constituency of Brigg and Cleethorpes).

On polling day, McIsaac spent most of the day knocking on doors in the town of Immingham, formerly the strongest Labour supporting area of the constituency, ironically reminiscent of Jeffrey Archer when he represented the town over 20 years earlier. In recent years opinion in Immingham has changed and it is now represented by two Conservative and one LibDem councillor on North East Lincolnshire Council. 

McIsaac and neighbouring MP Austin Mitchell tabled an early day motion in 1998 affirming support for Grimsby Town Football Club's trip to Wembley for the 1998 Auto Windscreen Shield Final and the 1998 Nationwide Division 2 Play-Off Final.

McIsaac was re-elected at the 2005 general election  Despite the Conservatives deselecting their candidate just 4 months before polling day their new candidate achieved an above-average swing reducing McIsaac's majority to just 2,642.

McIsaac presently serves as Parliamentary Private Secretary to a government minister and was described as asking "sycophantic questions in the Commons" by the national newspapers in their post-2005 general election coverage.

Her majority was significantly cut in the 2005 general election, receiving 43% of the vote.  The Conservative condidate received 37.3% of the votes.

William Edmund Newton Sinclair (1873-1947), known as W.E.N. Sinclair, was a Canadian politician. 

Sinclair was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1911 provincial election but was defeated in 1914.

He returned to politics in the 1917 federal election on conscription (see: Conscription Crisis of 1917), Sinclair ran on as part of the anti-conscription "Laurier Liberals" but was again defeated. 

He returned to provincial politics and was elected again to the Ontario legislature in the 1919 provincial election as the MLA for the riding of Ontario South. 

Sinclair ran for the leadership of the party in the 1922 leadership convention, but lost to Wellington Hay. Hay resigned following a disastrous election result, and Sinclair served as interim leader of the Ontario Liberal Party from 1923 to 1930 and also as Leader of the Opposition in the provincial legislature. He was interim leader for that length of time (and through the elections of 1926 and 1929) because of the party's state of disorganization and inability to hold a proper leadership convention. 

The Liberals remained at the 14 seats they had in 1926, and dropped to 13 seats in the 1929 election. Sinclair initially decided to run for the permanent leadership in 1930, but because of the party's failure to make gains during his tenure, he attracted little support, and withdrew before balloting began. He remained Leader of the Opposition until the 1934 election because the newly-elected leader, Mitchell Hepburn, did not have a seat in the provincial legislature. Sinclair was re-elected in the 1934 election that brought the Liberals to power but Hepburn, the new Premier of Ontario, did not appoint him to Cabinet. Sinclair sat as a government backbencher for three years and then retired from the legislature at the 1937 provincial election. 

In the 1945 federal election, Sinclair was elected to the Canadian House of Commons for the Liberal Party of Canada. He died in office in 1947.

In English grammar, a false singular occurs when a singular noun ending in a s or z sound is understood as a plural from which a new singular is constructed.  The false singular is a form of back-formation.

Some false singulars become standard English.  For example, pea was originally a false singular from pease pl. peasen.  (The old word remains in the phrase pease porridge.)

The non-standard historical forms Chinee and Portuguee are also false singulars, from Chinese and Portuguese.

<doc id="574909" title="Alien Nation (film)" nonfiltered="1040" processed="1031" dbindex="451051">


Alien Nation is a 1988 science fiction movie written by Rockne S. O'Bannon and directed by Graham Baker.  It stars James Caan, Mandy Patinkin, Terence Stamp, and Kevyn Major Howard.

The movie's plot concept later became the basis for a television series of the same name, which premiered in 1989. A book series began in 1993. In the late 1990s, five television movies were made as a continuation of the television series.


The movie is set in 1991, three years after a flying saucer bearing enslaved aliens (the "Newcomers") has crash-landed in the Mojave Desert. Los Angeles becomes a new home for the aliens, who take, or in some cases are assigned, Earth-like names (such as "Rudyard Kipling"). Caan plays Los Angeles police detective Matthew Sykes, who loses his partner when they try to stop two Newcomers in what appears to be a robbery of a small Newcomer-owned store. The next day Sykes' commanding officer informs his squad that they will have to work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective, Sam Francisco, played by Patinkin, and if someone doesn't volunteer to work with him the commanding officer shall choose someone. Sykes volunteers to work with Francisco, feeling that as he investigates crimes involving Newcomers he will find opportunities to also investigate his partner's death, which he is officially forbidden to do.

Sykes tells Sam that the name given him by an immigration official is embarrassing, and calls his partner George. As the pair continue to be assigned cases which mainly deal with Newcomer criminals and victims and as the cases progress, Sykes is able to learn to appreciate his partner.

The main villain of the film is an ambitious Newcomer businessman who plans to sell a drug which was used to pacify the Newcomers when they were slaves.

Analysis.
The Tenctonese/Newcomers have been bred to work in a wide variety of environments, readily adapting to different conditions.  As a result, they rapidly assimilate American culture and even become viewed by some human characters in the film as an economic threat when they begin to very quickly advance through the education system and workforce.  The film (and the subsequent television series even more so) is a metaphor for immigration, assimilation, suspicion of new arrivals and caste systems.

Parodies.
The season eight episode of South Park, "Goobacks" heavily satirizes this film.

Robert "Rob" Ramage was born on January 11, 1959 in Byron, Ontario, Canada and was a professional ice hockey player from 1979 to 1994.

Playing career.
Ramage was selected first overall by the Colorado Rockies in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. He spent his junior career with the London Knights, who have since retired his number 5, and also played a season in the World Hockey Association for the Birmingham Bulls. His National Hockey League career spanned fifteen seasons, during which he played for the Rockies, the St. Louis Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, Minnesota North Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, Montreal Canadiens, and Philadelphia Flyers.

In his rookie season with Colorado, Ramage became a part of history in a rather embarrassing way.  While the Rockies were playing the New York Islanders, the Rockies' goaltender left the ice for an extra skater after a delayed penalty was called on the Islanders.  The puck deflected off the chest protector of Islanders goalie Billy Smith into the corner.  Ramage picked up the puck and accidentally made a blind pass from the corner boards in the opposing zone to the blue line. Nobody was there to receive the pass, and so the puck sailed all the way down the length of the ice and into the Colorado net.  Smith had been the last Islander to touch the puck, and so he became the first goalie ever to be credited with a goal.

In spite of this gaffe, and in spite of being traded very often during his career, he got his name engraved on the prestigious Stanley Cup twice as a member of the 1989 Calgary Flames and the 1993 Montreal Canadiens. His role was limited on the '89 Calgary Flames, though, due to an already-strong Calgary defensive corps featuring the likes of Al MacInnis and Gary Suter.

On December 15, 2003, Ramage was behind the wheel when his car swerved into the oncoming lane and got into an accident, killing passenger and former Chicago Blackhawk captain Keith Magnuson. Charged with impaired driving causing death, Ramage's future remains uncertain.

He is currently a broker at the Frontenac, MO branch of A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. brokerage firm.

According to a Toronto Sun article late in 2006 Ramage's lawyer is stalling on court procedings in the hope of having the charges thrown out of court for delay of a speedy trial,thus allowing Ramage to walk away from vehicular murder.

John MacAlpine ( Maccabeus) (died December 6,1557) Protestant theologian was born in Scotland about the beginning of the 16th century and graduated at a Scottish university. From 1532 to 1534 he was prior of the Dominican convent of Perth; but having in the latter year been summoned with Alexander Ales and others to answer for heresy before the Bishop of Ross, he fled to England, where he was granted letters of denization on April 7, 1537, and married Agnes Macheson, a fellow exile for religion; her sister Elizabeth became the wife of Miles Coverdale. The reaction of 1539 made England doubtful refuge and on November 25, 1540. MacAlpine matriculated at the university of Wittenberg. He had already graduated BA at Cologne, and in 1542 proceeded to his doctorate at Wittenberg. in that year, being known as Maccabeus, he accepted Christain III's offer to the chair of theology at the university of Copenhagen, which had been endowed out of the spoils of the Church. Melanchthon spoke well of MacAlpine and with Peter Plade (Palladius) who had studied at Wittenberg, MacAlpine took a prominent part in building up the Lutheran Church of Denmark.  joint exposure of Plade and MacAlpine of Osiander's errors was published in 1552 and reprinted in Leipzig and Copenhagen in 1768, and MacAlpine was one of the four translators of Luther's German Bible into Danish.

The Hui Minorities' War is the modern term used by the People's Republic of China for what used to be called the Dungan Revolt or Muslim Rebellion.  The term is sometimes used to refer to the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan as well.  It was an uprising by members of the Hui minority from the Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia provinces of China between 1862 and 1877. The uprising was directed against the Qing Dynasty and actively encouraged by the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion. When it failed, it instigated immigration of some of the Dungan people into Imperial Russia.

 Background .
Chinese Muslims had been traveling to West Asia for many years prior to the Hui Minorities' War. In the 18th century, several prominent Muslim clerics from Gansu studied in Mecca and Yemen under the Naqshbandi Sufi teachers. Two different forms of Sufism were brought back to Northwest China by two charismatic Hui sheikhs: Khafiya (also spelt Khafiyya or Khufiyah; , H f y ), associated with the name of Ma Laichi (   , 1681-1766), and a more radical Jahriyya (also spelt Jahriya, Jahariyya, Jahariyah, etc.; , Zhéhèlíny , or     , Zhéhér ny ), founded by Ma Mingxin (    or    , 1719(?)-1781). The coexisted with the more traditional, non-Sufi Sunni practices, centered around local mosques and known  as gedimu (    or    ). The Khafiya school, as well as non-Sufi gedimu tradition, both tolerated by the Qing authorities, were referred to by them as the "Old Teaching" (  ), while Jahriya, viewed as suspect, became known as the "New Teaching" (  ).

Disagreements between the adherents of Khafiya and Jahriya, as well as perceived mismanagement, corruption, and anti-Muslim attitudes of the Qing officials resulted in attempted risings by Hui and Salar followers of the New Teaching in 1781 and 1783, but they were promptly suppressed.

 The course of the rebellion .
As the Taiping troops approached south-eastern Shaanxi in the spring of 1862, the local Han Chinese, encouraged by the Qing government, formed tuanlin (trad.   , simplfied   ) militias to defend the region against the Taipings. Afraid of the armed Han, the Muslims formed their own tuanlian units.

According to modern researchers (Lipman (1998), p. 120-121), the Muslim rebellion of started in 1862 not as a centralized planned uprising, but as coalescing of many local brawls and riots triggered by seemingly trivial causes. 
The prestige of the Qing dynasty being low and their armies being busy elsewhere, the rebellion that started in the spring of 1862 in the Wei River valley was able to spreadly rapidly throughout the southeastern Shaanxi. By late June 1862, the organized Muslim fighter bands were able to besiege Xi'an, which was not relieved by the Qing general Dolongga (, Duo Long-a) until the fall of 1863.

A vast number of Muslim refugees from Shaanxi fled to Gansu. Some of them formed the "Eighteen Great Batallions" in eastern Gansu, intending to fight back to their homes in Shaanxi.

While the Hui rebels took over Gansu and Shaanxi, Yaqub Beg, who had fled from Kokand Khanate in 1865 or 1866 after losing Tashkent to the Russians, set himself up as the ruler in Kashgar, soon taking over the entire Xinjiang.

In 1867 the Qing government sent one of their best officials, Zuo Zongtang, a hero of the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion, to Shaanxi.  His forces were ordered to help put down the Nian Rebellion and he was not able to deal with the Muslim rebels until December 1868. Zuo's approach was to rehabilitate the region by promoting agriculture, especially cotton and grain as well as supporting orthodox Confucian education. Due to the poverty of the region Zuo had to rely on financial support from outside the North-West.  

After suppressing the rebellion in Shaanxi and building up enough grain reserves to feed his army, Zuo attacked the most important Muslim leader, Ma Hualong (   ). Zuo's troops reached Ma's stronghold, the city of Jinjibao in what was then north-eastern Gansu  in September of 1870, bringing Krupp siege guns with him. After a sixteen months' siege, Ma Hualong was forced to surrender in January of 1871. 

Zuo sentenced Ma and over eighty of his officials to death by slicing. Thousands of Muslims were exiled to different parts of China. 

Zuo's next target was Hezhou (now known as Linxia), the main Hui people center west of Lanzhou and a key point on the trade route between Gansu and Tibet. Hezhou was defended by the Muslim forces of Ma Zhan'ao (   ). Not a Jahriya (New Teaching) adherent, he was a pragmatic member of the Khafiya (Old Teaching) movement, ready to explore avenues for peaceful coexistence with the Qing state. After successfully repulsing Zuo's offensive against Hezhou in 1872, he offered to surrender his stronghold to the empire, and offered his assistance to the Qing for the duration of the war. His diplomatic skills are evidenced by the success he managed achieved in preserving his community: while Zuo Zongtang pacified other areas by moving the Muslims elsewhere (in the spirit of the    (xi Hui), "washing off the Muslims" approach that had been long advocated by some officials), in Hezhou it were the non-Muslims whom Zuo relocated out of the area. The Hezhou (Linxia) area remains heavily Muslim to this day, achieving the status of Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture under the PRC.

Zuo's troops being reinforced by some of the Hezhou Muslims that have changed sides, he now planned to 
proceed westward, along the Hexi Corridor toward Xinjiang. However, he felt it necessary to first secure his left flank by taking Xining, which not only had a large Muslim community of its own, but also sheltered many of the refugees from Shaanxi. After three months' resistance, Xining fell to Zuo's commander Liu Jintang in the late fall of 1872. The defenders' commander Ma Guiyuan was captured, and thousands of armed defenders was killed. The Muslim population of Xining was spared, however; the Shaanxi refugees sheltered there were resettled or arable lands in eastern and southern Gansu, isolated from other Muslim areas.

Despite repeated offers of amnesty, many Muslims continued to resist at their last Gansu stronghold in Suzhou (now known as Jiuquan), which sits astride the Hexi Corridor in the western part of the province. The defence of the city was commanded by Ma Wenlu, originially from Xining; many Hui that had retreated from Shaanxi were there as well. After securing his supply lines, Zuo besieged Suzhou the city in September 1873 with 15,000 troops under his personal command. The Huis' rifles were no match to Zuo's siege guns, and the fortress fell on October 24. Zuo had 7,000 Muslims executed, and resettled the survivors in southern Gansu, to ensure that the entire Gansu Corridor from Lanzhou to Dunhuang would remain Muslim-free, preventing any possibility of future collusion between the Hui of Gansu and Shanxi and the Turkic people (now known as Uyghurs) of Xinjiang.

 The rebellion in Xinjiang .

 Rebels seize the north .
The Muslim uprising spread to central Xinjiang in the summer of 1864, when the Hui soldiers of the Urumqi garrison rebelled. Large parts of the city were destroyed, the tea warehouses burned, and any Manchus stationed there lost their lives. Then the rebels started advancing westward thru what is today Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, taking Manas (east of today's Shihezi) and Wusu.

By the early August 1864, the Hui population of Kuldja, the main city of the Ili Valley region, rose too, perhaps in anticipation of repressions from the authorities; Kulja's Taranchis (Turkic-speaking farmers who were to form later part of the Uyghur people) joined. When the local Muslim Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people felt that the rebels are gained the upper hand, they joined it as well; on the other hand, the Buddhist Kalmyks and Xibe mostly stayed loyal to the Qing government. After 12 days of heavy fighting in the streets of Kulja's Chinese Town (at the time, the center of the imperial administration in Xinjiang), the Hui and Uyghur rebels started to retreat; the local Hans, seeing the Manchus winning, joined  forces with them. 

However, the Qing forces' counter-offensive failed. The imperial troops lost their artillery; the local Qing commander (, jiangjun), Ming Xu (  ), barely  escaped capture. With the fall of Wusu and Aksu, the Qing garrison, entrenched in the Kulja fortress, was completely cut off from the rest of empire-controlled territory; Ming Xu had to send his communications to Beijing via Russia.

While the Qing forces in Kulja successfully repelled the next attack of the rebels (12 December, 1864), the rebellion kept spreading thru the northern part of the province, Dzungaria, where the Kazakhs were glad to take revenge on the Kalmyks that used to rule the area in the past. 


For the Chinese New Year of 1865, the Hui leaders of Tacheng (Chuguchak) invited the local Qing authorities and Kalmyk nobles to assemble in the Hui mosque, in order to swear a mutual oath of peace. But once the Manchus and Kalmyks were in the mosque, the Huis seized the city armory, and started killing the Manchus. After two days of fighting, the Muslims were in control of the town, while the Manchus were besieged in the fortress. 
However, with the Kalmyk help, the Manchus were able to retake the Tacheng area by the fall of 1865. This time it was the Huis turn to be locked up in the mosque. The fighting resulted in the utter destruction of Tacheng and the surviving residents fleeing the town.

Both the Qing government in Beijing and the beleaguered Kulja officials asked the Russian for assistance against the rebellion (via Russian envoy in Beijing, G.A. Vlangali, and via the Russian commander in Semirechye, General Gerasim Kolapakovsky () respectively). The Russians, however, were diplomatically non-committal: on the one hand, as Vlangali wrote to Saint Petersburg, a "complete refusal" would be bad for Russia's relations with Beijing; on the other hand, as Russian generals in Central Asia felt, seriously helping China against Xinjiang's Muslims would do nothing to improve Russia's problems with its own new Muslim subjects - and in case the rebellion were to succeed and form a permanent Hui stete, having been on the Qing's side would do nothing good for Russia's relations with that new neighbor. The decision was thus made in Saint Petersburg in 1865 to avoid offering any serious help to the Qing, beyond agreeing to train Chinese soldiers in Siberia - should they send any - and to sell some grain to the defenders of Kuldja on credit. The main priority of Russian government was in guarding its border with China and preventing any possibility of the spread of the rebellion into Russia's own domain.

Considering that offense is the best defense, Kolpakovsky suggested to his superiors in February 1865 that Russia should go beyond defending its border and move in force into Xinjiang's border area, seizing Chuguchak, Kulja and Kashgar and colonizing the area with Russian settlers - all to better protect the Romanovs' empire's other domains. The time was not ripe for such an adventure, however: as Foreign Minister Gorchakov noted, such a breach of neutrality would be not a good thing if China does recover its rebel provinces, after all.

Meanwhile the Qing forces in the Ili Valley did not fare well. In April 1865, the town of Bayandai (   ), some 10 km northwest of Kulja, fell to the rebels after three months' siege. Its  8,000 Manchu, Xibe, and Solon defenders were massacred, and two survivors, their ears and noses cut off, sent to Kulja - Qing's last stronghold in the Valley - to tell the jiangjun about the fate of Bayndai.

Most of the city of Kulja fell to the Hui rebels on January 20, 1866. Most of the residents and garrison perished; some 700 rebels died as well. Ming Xu, still holding out in the Kulja citadel with the remainder of his troops, but having run out of food, sent a delegation to the rebels, bearing a gift of 40 sycees of silver and four boxes of green tea, and offering to surrender, provided the rebels guarantee their lives and allow them to keep their allegiance to the Qing government. 12 Manchu officials with their families left the citadell along with the delegation. The Huis and Uyghurs received the delegation and allowed them to settle in the Old Town of Kulja; however, they would not accept Ming Xu's condition, requiring that he surrenders immeidatelt and recognizes the authority of the rebels. Ming Xu refusing these conditions, the rebels proceeded to storm the citadel at once. On March 3, the rebels having broken into the citadel, Ming Xu assembled his family and staff in his mansion, and blew it up, dying under its ruins. This was the end, for the time being, of the Qing rule in the Ili Valley.

Kashgaria.
In the Tarim Basin - the mostly-Uyghur part of Xinjiang south of Tian Shan, the area then commonly known as West Turkestan - 
the rebellion started in 1863, fairly independently from the Hui uprising in heartland China and northern Xinjiang. It was first led by the Khoja (member of a Kashgar ruling clan) Buzurg Khan, son of Jehangir Khoja, who had lead the previous major Kashgar rebellion in the 1820s. 



 The flight of the Dungans to Russian Empire .
The failure of the uprising  led to some immigration of Hui people into the Imperial Russia. According to Rimsky-Korsakoff (1992), three separate groups of the Hui people fled to Russian Empire across the Tian Shan Mountains during the exceptionally severe winter of 1877/78:
 The first group, of some 1000 people, originally from Turfan in Xinjiang, led by Ma Daren (   ), also known as Ma Da-lao-ye (    ), reached Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan.
 The second group, of 1130 people, originally from Didaozhou (   ) in Gansu, led by ahong A Yelaoren (    ), were settled in the spring of 1878 in the village of Yardyk some 15 km from Karakol in Eastern Kyrgyzstan. They numbered 1130 on arrival.
 The third group, originally from Shaanxi, led by Bai Yanhu (   ; also spelt Bo Yanhu; 1829(?)-1882), one of the leaders of the rebellion, were settled in the village of Karakunuz (now Masanchi), is modern Zhambyl Province of Kazkhstan. Masanchi is located on the northern (Kazakh) side of the Chu River, 8 km north from the city Tokmak in north-western Kyrgyzstan. This group numbered 3314 on arrival.

Another wave of immigration followed in the early 1880s.
In accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg signed in February 1881, which required the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops from the Upper Ili Basin (the Kulja area), the Hui and Taranchi (Uighur) people of the region were allowed to opt for moving to the Russian side of the border. Most choose that option; according to the Russian statistics, 4,682 Hui moved to Russian Empire under the treaty. They migrated in many small groups between 1881-83, settling in the village of Sokuluk some 30 km west of Bishkek, as well as in a number of points between the Chinese border and Sokuluk, in south-eastern Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan.

The descendants of these rebels and refugees still live in Kyrgyzstan and neighboring parts of  Kazakhstan  and Uzbekistan. The still call themselves the Hui people (Huizu), but to the outsiders they are known under the Turkic name of the Hui, Dungan.

Among evidence scholars, the study of evidence in recent decades has become broadly interdisciplinary, incorporating insights from psychology, feminism, economics, and probability theory. 

One area of particular interest and controversy has been Bayes' theorem. Bayes  theorem is an elementary proposition of probability theory.  It provides a way of updating, in light of new information, one s prior estimate of the probability that a proposition is true. Evidence scholars  been interested in  its application to their field,  either to study  the value of rules of evidence or to help determine facts at trial. 

Suppose, for example, that the proposition to be proven is that defendant was the source of a hair found at the crime scene.  Before learning that the hair was a genetic match for the defendant s hair, the factfinder believes that the odds are 2 to 1 that the defendant was the source of the hair.  If she used Bayes  theorem, she could  multiply those prior odds by a  likelihood ratio  in order to update her odds after learning that the hair matched the defendant s hair.   The likelihood ratio is a statistic derived by comparing the odds that the evidence (expert testimony of a match) would be found if the defendant was the source with the odds that it would be found if defendant was not the source.  If it is ten times more likely that the testimony of a match  would occur if the defendant was the source than if not, then the factfinder should multiply her prior odds by ten, giving posterior odds of 20 to one. 

Bayesian skeptics have objected to this use of Bayes  theorem in litigation on a variety of grounds. These run from jury confusion and computational complexity to the assertion that standard probability theory is not a normatively satisfactory basis for adjudication of rights. 

Bayesian enthusiasts have replied on two fronts. First, they have said that whatever its value in litigation, Bayes  theorem is valuable in studying evidence rules.  For example, it can be used to model relevance.  It teaches that the relevance of evidence that a proposition is true depends on how much the evidence changes the prior odds, and that how much it changes the prior odds depends on how likely the evidence would be found (or not) if the proposition were true. These basic insights are also useful in studying individual evidence rules, such as the rule allowing witnesses to be impeached with prior convictions. 

Second, they have said that it is practical to use Bayes' theorem in a limited set of circumstances in litigation (such as integrating  genetic match evidence with other evidence), and that assertions that probability theory is inappropriate for judicial determinations are  nonsensical or inconsistent. 

In recent years, the debate has become stagnant.  The parties have been  talking past each other, and not much  is happening at the high-theory level.  The most interesting work is in the empirical study of the efficacy of instructions on Bayes  theorem in improving jury accuracy.

Long Preston is a village situated in Craven, North Yorkshire, England, in the Yorkshire Dales. It lies along the A65 road, and is 12 miles from the larger town of Skipton and 4 miles from the town of Settle. The population of Long Preston in 2001 was 680 residents.

 History .
 Early Ages .

Human occupation of the area around Long Preston goes back to prehistoric times as remains have been found at Victoria Cave on the hills above Settle. Also a stone age axe head was found in the area of Bookil Gill.

 Middle Ages .

In 1086, Long Preston was known as Prestune, meaning "the priest's farmstead or town". Later on "Long" was added, referring to its linear development and distinguishing Long Preston from the many other Prestons.

The first school built in the village was during the reign of Edward IV (1461-1483) which was part of the Hammerton Chapel. It is likely that it was closed in 1641 during the dissolution of the religious houses. In 1672 The Petty School was held most likely either in the chapel or in a building near an old vicarage. The new school replaced The Petty School in 1819.

 Industrial Age .

In the 1700s and 1800s, Long Preston was dominated by agriculture and the trades associated with it. In the 1750s a turnpike road was constructed from Long Preston to Settle. In the 1960s this road (now the A65) was raised, widened, and straighted. Several homes and farms were demolished to accomplish this.

In 1790, a cotton spinning mill was constructed, possibly built on the site of an old corn mill. The mill was demolished in 1881 due to flooding.
Later on Fleets cotton mill was built which was 3 storeys high and water powered.

The railway was opened in the 1800s which declined in the 1970s and 80s but is now seeing an increase in freight and light passenger traffic. 

In 1801 the population was 573 and rose to 808 in 1831 but later dropped to 610 in 1961, most probably due to the end of the Industrial Revolution where people moved to the towns and cities to find work in the mills.

 Modern Day .

Between 1923 and 1935, Long Preston was the railhead for the construction of Stocks Reservoir built by the Fylde Water Board (FWB). Steam traction engines hauled material between the FWB depot, to the west of the current station, by road to Tosside where connection was made with a 3 foot gauge industrial railway system that served the dam construction project (Bowtell, 1988).

In the 20th century, most people were employed in the town at the garage, wool warehouse, auction mart, farms etc. or in the surrounding area, e.g. Skipton. A number of houses were rented at Long Preston making it affordable to live there. In the 1960s people started to purchase their own homes.

In the late 50s and early 60s, there was a thriving livestock auction mart, shoe shop, tailors, butchers, bakers, post office, cafés, wool warehouse and corn mill.

A bypass was proposed and was given the go-ahead in 1994 after a lot of money had been spent on planning. After the general election, with Labour gaining power, the bypass was scrapped.

Long Preston is the home of audio book producer, Magna Story Sound.

Long Preston is served by Long Preston railway station which is on the Airedale Line.

<doc id="4901809" title="Scrambler (randomizer)" nonfiltered="1062" processed="1052" dbindex="451075">
In telecommunications and recording, a scrambler (often erroneously referred to as a randomizer) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a descrambler at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and PSTN modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the  modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context, has nothing to do with encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligeable, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.

A scrambler replaces sequences into other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.

 Purposes of scrambling .

There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:

 It facilitates the work of a timing recovery circuit, an automatic gain control and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).

 It eliminates the dependence of a signal's power spectrum upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the cross modulation and the intermodulation caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).

 Types of scramblers .

 Additive  (synchronous) scramblers;
 Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers;

 Additive (synchronous) scramblers .



Additive scramblers (they are also referred to as synchronous) transform the input data stream by applying a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the Read-only memory is used, but more often it is generated by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR).

In order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, scrambler and descrambler), a sync-word must be used.

A sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each frame). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined initial state.

The additive descrambler is just the same device as the additive scrambler.

Additive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is ) and its initial state.

 Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers .





Multiplicative scramblers are called so because they perform a multiplication of the input signal by the scrambler's transfer function in Z-space. They are discrete linear time-invariant systems.
A multiplicative scrambler is recursive and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called self-synchronizing. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is ), which is also a transfer function of the descrambler.

 Comparison of scramblers .

Scramblers have certain drawbacks: 

Both types may fail to generate random sequences under worst case input conditions. 

Multiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling i.e. a single bit error at the descrambler's input will result into w errors at its output, where w equals the number of the scrambler's feedback taps. 

Additive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails massive error propagation will result as a complete frame cannot be descrambled. 

The effective length of the random sequence of an additive scrambler is limited by the frame length, which is normally much shorter than the period of the PRBS. By adding frame numbers to the frame sync, it is possible to extend the length of the random sequence, by varying the random sequence in accordance with the frame number.

The Horton Light Railway was built in 1905 to transport materials for building the Longrove Asylum that was needed in addition to the previously built Manor Hospital. It was later used to serve other London County Council psychiatric hospitals built in the Horton area to the west of the English town of Epsom. It never (officially) carried passengers - its main purpose being to carry coal and other supplies to the hospitals. 

The railway connected with the main network near to Ewell West railway station.

Up to nine hundred workers travelled from Waterloo Station to Ewell West station every day to build the hospitals. The workers had to walk the two and a half miles from Ewell West station to the hospitals as passengers were never officially carried on the railway.

It was a standard gauge light railway built by Forster & Dicksee with the help of a Manning Wardle 0-6-0 saddle tank locomotive named "Hollymoor", or "Puffing Billy" to the local residents. Other locomotives used on the line included "Crossness", "Hendon" and "Sherwood".

It closed, and the track lifted, circa 1950. The track routes are now walking and riding paths in Horton Country Park.

Symphony of Decay is an unreleased EP by the rock band Third Eye Blind.

The EP is the result of a deal struck in 1999 between Third Eye Blind's label, Elektra Records, and the band regarding a track on their album, Blue. Because of the violent, controversial lyrics in the song "Slow Motion" and currents events such as the tragedy at Columbine High School, Elektra forced the band to release Blue with an instrumental version of "Slow Motion." However, because of this censorship, the band was given a $1 million dollar advance from Elektra to start their own label. On this label, Elektra suggested that they release the unedited "Slow Motion" as part of an EP.

After Blue was released, with the censored version of "Slow Motion", the band mentioned that they would indeed work on an EP of 6 or 7 songs. It was scheduled to contain the full version of "Slow Motion" and another one or two songs with vocals, as well as several instrumentals. This EP became known amongst fans as "Black" or "Symphony of Decay" due to naming ideas thrown about by the band; a member  of the band confirmed the "Symphony of Decay" title in 2004.

The EP has now been finished but Elektra refused to release it because of its lack of commercial viability. Instead, the label insisted on a new album from the band. The band hopes to find a way to release the completed EP in the future.

Robert Swirsky (born December, 1962, Brooklyn, NY) is a computer scientist, author, and pianist. In the early 1980s, Swirsky was one of the first regular contributors to the nascent computer magazine industry. His articles appeared in magazines including Popular Computing, Kilobaud Microcomputing, Interface Age, and Creative Computing.

Robert Swirsky holds Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from Hofstra University, and is one of Hofstra's Alumni of Distinction. After graduating, he worked on projects ranging from aircraft avionics to one of the first all-software digital radio receivers for a VLF submarine application.

In 1989, Swirsky moved to California, and joined Olivetti Advanced Technology's Unix group. He was a frequent speaker at Uniforum, Usenix, and other Unix shows, and hosted parties where he entertained people with song parodies about the Unix computer operating system, which were featured in a special Evatone Soundsheet issue of Interface Age magazine.

After Olivetti, Swirsky went to Adobe Systems and was a member of the core PostScript team, and the team that developed the first versions of Photoshop for Microsoft Windows, including Win32s on Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11. His work made him a participant in many industry standards committees, such as TWAIN, and was a frequent speaker and contributor at ACM SIGGRAPH events and meetings. Before leaving Adobe in 1998, he worked with Will Harvey on HTML rendering technology.

The Disney Years.
In 1998, Robert Swirsky started working for Walt Disney Imagineering R&D, under Bran Ferren, developing electronic games and digital imaging systems. He developed technology to play interactive games synchronized with live television shows, and electronic toys including Disney's Magical Moments Pin. Digital Photography projects included systems to synchronize picture taking with ride vehicles, and active infrared badges to identify picture-takers.

Mr. Swirsky was a major technical contributor to ABC's Enhanced TV, an Emmy Award winning technology that allows television viewers to play along with game shows, sporting events, and answer live polls during talk shows.

Swirsky's interactive media research also involved working with nerdcore rapper Monzy, then an intern at Walt Disney Imagineering, on a variety of cutting edge display technologies, including the display of digital data on a spherical surface.

Mr. Swirsky continues to work as a consultant for the themed entertainment industry, for Disney and other amusement enterprises.

3D Photography.
Swirsky is best known for his work in 3D digital photography. He has developed algorithms for generating full-color anaglyph images from stereo pairs that can be viewed through red/cyan glasses. A popular freeware program, Callipygian 3D is widely used and has been featured on TechTV's The Screen Savers show several times, with Swirsky demonstrating its use. The popularity of anaglyph images from Mars, and in kids movies like Spy Kids 3D introduced a large number of people to the art of making stereo images. Swirsky's software played a major role in letting people create their own anaglyph images.

Production Company.
In 2003, Swirsky started a production company, Swirsky-AO, to produce and distribute short films and related media for the portable media player market. Swirsky-AO has a 20-acre lot adjacent to Walt Disney World in Florida. This property, known as "Swampworth" is used as a filming location for many of Swirsky-AO's productions, and serves as a residence and studio for Swirsky's other projects.

Kings County is a county in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

Kings County is located in central Nova Scotia on the shore of the Bay of Fundy with its northeastern part also forming the western shore of the Minas Basin.

The part of the county residing in the Annapolis Valley comprises the agricultural heartland of the province and boasts over 600 farms; the area is famous for its fruit crops, primarily apples.  As with most coastal parts of the Maritimes, Kings County's shoreline was home to a productive shipbuilding industry during the 1800s.

Wolfville is home to the highly ranked Acadia University.  Cape Blomidon and the North Mountain preside over the Annapolis Valley, whereas the South Mountain and interior forests to the southern part of the county support a variety of lakes and recreational cottaging areas.

History.
The first inhabitants of the coast, valley and interior of Kings County were the Mi'kmaq.  Archaeological evidence from sites in the area indicate Mi'kmaq habitation dates back thousands of years. The Mi'kmaq were a semi-nomadic people who followed seasonal food sources.  Their lives would be forever changed with the arrival of the Europeans. 

The colonization of  Les Mines  and Grand Pre began in the 1680s when a few families relocated from French settlement at Port Royal. These  Acadians  settlers were named after the French name for the land  Acadie  meaning  land of plenty . These farmers were accustomed to farming on dyked lands, and did so here as well. This took place on the normally salty but fertile marshes that were found on the banks of the Minas Basin, through the use of dykes and aboiteaux that allowed the fresh water out but kept out the salt water tide.  The Acadians farmers prospered in Kings County, and lived harmoniously with the Mi'kmaq. 

After the final defeat of and expulsion of the Acadians, British control of the land was secured by repopulating the former French lands with settlers from the New England States. Between 1760 and 1768 some 8000 New Englanders came to  plant  a new colony. Kings County was comprised of three agricultural townships: Horton, Cornwallis, and Aylesford. The legacy of the New England Planters is still a tangible part of the life in Kings County, and remains as the bedrock of many ideals held dear by Nova Scotians such as democratic government, freedom of religion and equality of education. 

The roots of Black Heritage in Kings County were established almost 250 years ago when the New England Planters brought slaves and freed Blacks with them to Horton and Cornwallis Townships. This initial population would swell with later migrations following the American Revolution and the War of 1812.

During the past two centuries these  founding cultures  would be supplemented by many other waves of immigration increasing and adding to the population and diversity of Kings County.

Other communities.
Towns in Kings County include Berwick, Kentville and Wolfville.

Indian Reserves in Kings County include Cambridge and Horton.

<doc id="232526" title="Bertrand's postulate" nonfiltered="1073" processed="1063" dbindex="451086">


Bertrand's postulate states that if n > 3 is an integer, then there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n   2. A weaker but more elegant formulation is: for every n > 1 there is always at least one prime p such that n < p < 2n.

This statement was first conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand (1822 1900). Bertrand himself verified his statement for all numbers in the interval 3   106.
His conjecture was completely proved by Chebyshev (1821 1894) in 1850 and so the postulate is also called the Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshev's theorem.  Ramanujan (1887 1920) gave a simpler proof , from which the concept of Ramanujan primes would later arise, and Erd s (1913 1996) in 1932 published a simpler proof using the Chebyshev function  (x), defined as:

 ;

where p   x runs over primes, and the binomial coefficients. See proof of Bertrand's postulate for the details.

 Sylvester's theorem .

Bertrand's postulate was proposed for applications to permutation groups. Sylvester (1814 1897) generalized it with the statement: the product of k consecutive integers greater than k is divisible by a prime greater than k.

 Erd s's theorems .

Erd s proved that for any positive integer k, there is a natural number N such that for all n > N, there are at least k primes between n and 2n. 

Erd s also proved there always exists at least two prime numbers p with n < p < 2n for all n > 6. Moreover, one of them is congruent to 1 modulo 4, and another one is congruent to  1 modulo 4.

The prime number theorem (PNT) suggests that the number of primes between n and 2n is roughly n/ln(n) when n is large, and so in particular there are many more primes in this interval than are guaranteed by Bertrand's Postulate.  That is, these theorems are comparatively weaker than the PNT. However, in order to use the PNT to prove results like Bertrand's Postulate, we would have to have very tight bounds on the error terms in the theorem -- that is, we have to know fairly precisely what "roughly" means in the PNT. Such error estimates are available but are very difficult to prove (and the estimates are only sufficient for large values of n). By contrast, Bertrand's Postulate can be stated more memorably and proved more easily, and makes precise claims about what happens for small values of n. (In addition, Chebyshev's theorem was proved before the PNT and so has historical interest.)

A similar and still unsolved Legendre's conjecture asks whether for every n > 1, there is a prime p, such that n2 < p < (n + 1)2. Again we expect from the PNT that there will be not just one but many primes between n2  and (n + 1)2, but in this case the error estimates on the PNT are not (indeed, cannot be) sufficient to prove the existence of even one prime in this interval.

Liberty in North Korea, commonly known as LiNK, is a non-profit, non-partisan, non-ethnic and non-religious group formed to accomplish the following mission:

To educate the world about North Korea;

To advocate for human rights, political and religious freedom, and humanitarian aid for North Korea;

To protect North Korean people where they can be reached.

To empower citizens of the world to take effective action and make a difference;

To bring together and support existing NGOs and other organizations working to achieve the same ends;

To tell the world the truth;

It was created first to educate Korean-American students throughout the United States about the sufferings of the North Korean people and the political context in which they are situated. LiNK has since expanded and is no longer limited to Koreans, to the United States, or to college students.

History.

Beginning in 2001, as more and more North Korean refugees made the harsh and dangerous trek to free nations, information about the North Korean human rights and humanitarian crisis began to spread all over the world. Defectors began to testify before major institutions internationally   from the United States Senate to United Nations hearings. 

Korean American leaders Adrian Hong and Paul Kim were moved by reports of severe human rights abuses, widespread malnourishment and the tragic plight of refugees in China, and decided they had to spread the word about the crisis. That following spring, at the Eighteenth Annual Korean American Students Conference (KASCON XVIII), held at Yale University, they arranged for the conference to feature several special seminars on North Korea, including a special talk by a North Korean defector, video clips of the escape attempts by North Korean refugees, and panel discussions on various aspects of the North Korea crisis. Nearly 800 Korean American leaders were present, including over 50 distinguished speakers, experts and important figures. 

LiNK was officially founded on March 27, 2004, the final day of the conference. The organization immediately spread across a wide collegiate network of Korean American student leaders, marking 40 chapters within one month of launching. As the organization spread, leaders began to raise awareness about the human rights crisis on their local cities and campuses. As LiNK leaders began to get more and more involved in the issue, they began to realize that raising awareness was not enough. Little was being done to address the issue, and existing groups combating the crisis were vastly undermanned and underfunded. 

The all-volunteer movement began to delve into activism- first by participating in protests, petition drives and public awareness campaigns. In December of 2004, LiNK sent two teams to the border of China and North Korea on fact-finding missions, to investigate conditions North Korean refugees faced, and interview many refugees in person. While on the trip, LiNK s investigators found that many North Korean orphans lived on the streets and had no protection from the authorities, as well as traffickers looking to prey upon the children. LiNK team members left China having established the first two shelters in what would grow to become Project: Safe Haven. 

LiNK was now firmly a group that would balance raising awareness and investigation of the crisis with actions to make improvements on the ground. It began to take a two-pronged approach of dealing with both the symptoms (the refugee crisis, food crisis) and the problems (the political oppression in the DPRK, poor food distribution) at once. 

Over the next year, LiNK began to engage in more extensive field projects, high-level advocacy, while continuing to expand it s chapters. As of November, 2006, LiNK had over 100 chapters worldwide, throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Korea.

Safe Haven.
Safe Haven was established by LiNK in November 2004 to shelter North Korean orphans in China.  There are about ten thousand orphaned children in China, mostly because their parents either abandoned them in a desperate attempt to increase their chances for survival or were repatriated to North Korea.  Because the Chinese government considers all North Korean refugees to be economic migrants, these orphans cannot obtain Chinese Citizenship. They do not have access to Chinese hospitals, schools, or shelter. Orphanages are established throughout China and are maintained by Chinese Koreans, South Koreans, or other North Korean refugees. Communication between these caretakers and LiNK are secretive, such that some caretakers do not even know anything about LiNK. The orphans range from toddlers to teenagers.  They are cared for until they become independent. Because these children are constantly at risk of being captured by Chinese authorities, the children are isolated from the rest of the world. A majority of LiNK's fundraising efforts go to Safe Haven. The goal of Safe Haven is to take in as many orphans as possible with the funds it raises and ultimately to smuggle them out to a free country.

Ornithomimodes ("bird mimmic-like") is a dubious genus of small theropod dinosaur, from the Late Cretaceous period (Coniacian to Santonian stages, 85-83 mya) of India. Two species have been itenditified, though they are known only from isolated vertebrae. O. barasimlensis is known from five dorsal vertebrae, and O. mobilis from four smaller vertebrae, found at the same location.

A work in progress translation of the Transrapid article from German to English is currently underway. If you are confident enough in your fluency of German and English, please feel free to assist with this translation.

Original article in German: 

Current translation in English: Transrapid/German



Transrapid is a German monorail system using magnetic levitation. Based on a patent from 1934, planning of an actual Transrapid system started in 1969. The test facility for the system in Emsland, Germany was completed in 1987, and on the 17th June 1993 the Transrapid TR-07 vehicle reached a record-breaking speed of 450 kilometers per hour. Today the maximum design speed has exceeded the 500 km/h (310 mph) mark and currently stands at about 550 km/h, with the fastest (and currently the only operational) scheduled passenger service reaching 430 km/h between Longyang Road station and Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, China. The system is developed and marketed by Transrapid International, a joint venture of the German companies Siemens AG and ThyssenKrupp.

Technology.
See also: Technology in the Magnetic levitation train article.;

The synchronous longstator linear motor of the Transrapid maglev system is used both for propulsion and braking. It functions like a rotating electric motor whose stator is cut open and stretched along under the guideway. Inside the motor windings, alternating current generates a magnetic traveling field which moves the vehicle without contact. The support magnets in the vehicle function as the excitation portion (rotor). The respective magnetic traveling field works in only one direction, and therefore makes moving train collisions less likely, as more than one train on the track section would travel in the same direction.

The superspeed maglev system has no wheels, axles, transmissions, or pantographs. It does not roll; it hovers. Electronic systems guarantee that the clearance remains constant (nominally 10 mm). To hover, the Transrapid requires less power than its air conditioning equipment. The levitation system and all onboard electronics are supplied by the power recovered from harmonic oscillations of magnetic field of the track's linear stator (Those oscillations being parasitic cannot be used for propulsion anyway) at speeds above 80 km/h, while at lower speeds power is obtained through physical connections to the track. In case of power failure of the track's propulsion system Transrapid car uses on-board backup batteries that can supply power to the levitation system.

Economic and environmental consideration.

At speeds below 300 km/h the Transrapid is less energy efficient than a modern high speed train, but considerably less noisy. It is also capable of climbing significantly steeper tracks, rendering it especially suitable for mountainous regions. It is possible to flexibly adapt its guideway to the landscape and to have it tightly follow existing roads, railroad tracks, and power lines. Therefore, no significant interventions in the environment are necessary and pristine landscape is protected. Furthermore, the original use of the landscape under the guideway is still possible (farming or grazing for example). However, track building costs are higher than for conventional high-speed trains.

Construction costs.

Building a maglev track is much more costly than a comparatively High-speed railway (HSR) line, if the terrain is flat and still slightly more costly if low mountain ranges have to be crossed. This is because of the more elaborate maglev track. On the other hand, there is little if any additional cost for crossing traffic of any kind, and the impact on the environment is also much smaller. Although they are not powered, the maglev vehicles cost much more than conventional high-speed trains. In comparison, maglev technology may have equal or only slightly higher costs once the time-saving benefits of a faster trip are taken into account. Thus, maglev technology gives a favorable ratio of travel time to infrastructure costs. However, due to its high costs, passenger comfort may be compromised as interior seating takes on more of a commercial jet-aircraft configuration than a typical passenger train one. One important consideration is that on a daily basis, each guideway must be taken off line for approximately four hours for inspection.

Maintenance costs.

While maglev costs more in terms of the overall project expenses, it saves in maintenance efforts and costs as well as energy consumption, as the Transrapid levitates and moves using contactless technology with minimal moving parts. Even though there is currently no long-time experience drawn from any commercial application, simulations and first data obtained from the Shanghai project currently support the assumptions.

Implementations.
Germany high-speed competition.
The Transrapid originated as one of the competing concepts for new land-based high speed public transportation for Germany. Another competing concept was the InterCityExpress (ICE). The ICE "won" in that it was adopted nationwide in Germany. It is argued that the ICE won out in part because of its ability to run on conventional tracks and railway stations. Nevertheless, the Transrapid was seen as the next step beyond the ICE and a major asset for possible export and consequently development was not scrapped at this point, but continued as well.

However, in the 1990s, intense political discussions about the Transrapid started in Germany. Though technically superior to normal railroad systems, the Transrapid was considered too expensive, as the companies developing it relied on federal subsidies. The controversy mostly raged over the question whether public money should be invested in construction of a track for commercial use. Plans for a track from Berlin to Hamburg were canceled because legislators were not convinced that the project would ever become profitable in competition to the existing (very old and slow) conventional railway line and hence were unwilling to invest the money in times of tight budgets - in spite of the alleged importance of having a working Transrapid system in Germany in order to ease marketing of the system abroad. Some even got as far as arguing that the Transrapid was generally unsuitable for Germany itself because of Germany's many larger and relatively close cities (with the resulting many stops at short intervals, the time needed to repeatedly accelerate to operation speed and to decelerate before stations becomes a limiting factor in average travel speed for high-speed transportation systems) and that a demonstration line would be better situated in a country where distances between cities are far larger than in Germany. This argument however is flawed in that the Transrapid provides much better acceleration than any HSR alternative does with both in their standard (i.e. commercially viable and operational) configurations, and subsequently, can show its advantages as much with closely spaced cities (acceleration advantage) as with largely spaced cities (top speed advantage).

China.

The only success so far was in the year 2000, when the Chinese government ordered a Transrapid track to be built connecting Shanghai to its Pudong International Airport. It was inaugurated in 2002. Regular daily trips started in March 2004. However, low passenger numbers, due to the remoteness of the terminal station from the city center and high ticket costs, hampered the line. During the first week, the average number of riders per train was only 73 people, while the maximum seating capacity is 440 passengers. One-way trip prices have since been reduced to 50 Renminbi ($6 USD).

Nevertheless, the Shanghai Project was designed primarily to demonstrate the state-of-the-art technology and capabilities of the Transrapid system. A high tilt compared with a relatively high speed of 430 km/h (267 mph) and leaving passengers in the outskirts of Pudong shows that the Chinese authorities were more interested in the technology transfer than commercial success. However, in terms of safety, reliability, availability, and functionality the Transrapid maglev system has demonstrated the readiness of this technology for commercial applications.

The Transrapid manufacturers hoped to obtain a subsequent order from China for a track connecting Shanghai with Beijing. Hence it was considered a serious drawback when in 2004 it is said that China considered to choose the Japanese high-speed train Shinkansen, to the disappointment of Siemens, which had hoped to sell at least the ICE which is manufactured by them as the Transrapid system partly is. Public disapproval of the idea shifted the decision further into the future. In 2006, Transrapid was officially excluded from the debate, even though the actual technology to be used remained undecided.

In November 2004 talks began about extending the track from Shanghai to Hangzhou, 180 km away. A maglev would shorten the travel time to less than a fifth of its current value, from 2  hours to 27 minutes.  On February 26th, Transrapid officials confided to German reporters that they had received initial approval for the line extension to Hangzhou, although they were quick to point out this is the first approval of many required for construction of an extension line. The extension was completely approved in 2006; however, disagreements about technology ownership and political interest continue to hamper the progress of the project.

Germany.
Approval is being sought for a 28 km Transrapid connection from the Bavarian capital Munich to Munich International Airport; the approval is currently in the hearing phase and will face objections from residents along the route. Such a connection would reduce the travel time from the current 40 minutes via Munich S-Bahn (German suburban rail system) to 15 minutes.

United Kingdom.
The Transrapid is also being considered by the UK government as a 500 km/h (310 mph) link between London and Glasgow, via Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, and Edinburgh. One of the main advantages of Transrapid over high-speed rail is cited as the requirement of at least two primary lines by HSR to provide the same reach as a single Transrapid route. UK Ultraspeed, the name of the project, provides further information on their website. The project has already gained considerable acceptance from politicians and local councils in the north of England and Scotland, including the CEO of First Scotrail . However many senior rail chiefs, as well as Network Rail in their recent report remain apprehensive towards the idea. Further information is available in the High-speed rail in the United Kingdom article.

 Projects elsewhere .
Since the 1990s there have been plans for two Transrapid lines in the Netherlands, one circular (Randstad) and one straight (Zuiderzee line: Amsterdam Groningen). Some local politicians even envisioned an extension to Northern Germany via Bremen to the then planned connection Hamburg Berlin. The current situation is stalled and if these lines will be built, the Netherlands probably will choose a conventional system.
There has been an EU study in the 1990s to co-fund a high-speed train network for Eastern Europe using Transrapid technology with lines from Berlin to Warsaw( Moscow), Krakow( Kiev) and Prague Vienna Budapest( Thessaloniki). Realisation of this huge project in the near future is unlikely.

In the USA there have been several evaluations for federal funding of pioneering links since 1997, especially on routes from center cities to airport and suburban hubs (Atlanta, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore Washington).  These routes are shorter than 100 km, but could be extended to other cities if successful (Chattanooga, Los Angeles San Diego/Anaheim, and Philadelphia New York City Boston, respectively).

There have been first talks for a project in the Gulf Region, connecting Bahrein Qatar UAE.

Accidents.
August 11, 2006 fire.

On August 11, 2006 a fire broke out on the Shanghai commercial Transrapid, shortly after leaving the Longyang terminal. This was the first accident on a maglev train in commercial operation. Passengers were able to disembark the train safely and no casualties were reported. The fire was thought to have originated below the passenger compartment, possibly as a result of battery malfunction.

September 22, 2006 accident.



On September 22, 2006 an elevated Transrapid train collided with a maintenance vehicle on a test run at 170 kilometers per hour in Lathen (Lower Saxony / north-western Germany).
The train did not derail. The maintenance vehicle destroyed the first section of the train, and came to rest on its roof. This was the first major accident involving a Transrapid train. Most of the passengers were in the first of the three sections of the Transrapid. The news media is reporting 23 fatalities and several severely injured after end of salvage work, these being the first ever fatalies on any maglev.

There were two men on the maintenance vehicle. They saw the train approaching and jumped to the ground. This was four or five metres down - a minor fall. The passengers on the train had no way to escape, and those that survived were evacuated by emergency personnel.

The accident is reported to have been caused by a combination of human error and a technical flaw. The maintenance vehicle carried out routine sweeps of the track to remove debris, fallen branches, etc. and is supposed to report back to the control centre via voice radio once it has cleared the track. Control personnel should not allow the main train to depart the station before the maintenance vehicle has cleared, but it appears that they failed to check the maintenance vehicle's position before the Transrapid vehicle departed.

The compounding technical flaw was that although Transrapid vehicles on the guideway are automatically tracked and controlled by the OCS, the maintenance vehicle did not operate in the same way and thus was not known to the computerized control system. Had the maintenance vehicle reported its position electronically as all Transrapid trains do, redundant computerized safety systems would never have allowed the passenger vehicle to approach.

The test track in Lathen is very simple. It consists of a main track and a single station with a side track. When you are in the station, it is easy to see whether the maintenance vehicle is somewhere on the track: if it is not parked in the station, it must be somewhere else.

The accident had also alarmed Shanghai, China, which also have their maglev train facilities built by Transrapid.

Alleged theft of Transrapid technology.
In an incident in December 2004, Chinese engineers entered into the Transrapid maintenance room in the middle of the night in Shanghai, took measurements of the train, and even filmed the whole incident, according to the German Economic Weekly, Wirtschaftswoche.  Wirtschaftswoche further speculated that it was a case of Transrapid technology theft.  Furthering the Transrapid Consortium's unease, the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group has announced it has developed its own high speed maglev technology, which it claims to be superior to that of Transrapid's, less than two years after the break-in.  Trials are supposed to begin this year of the new Chinese maglev technology in Shanghai.  According to the Spiegel Online however, the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group has been tinkering with maglev technology since 1986, so it is unknown if the maglev train about to run test trials in Shanghai is the result of technology theft or actual domestic research culminating in the creation of this new maglev train system or a combination of both.

However, the Changchun Railway Vehicles company announced in 2001, before the Transrapid maglev was in operation in Shanghai, that it was developing a competing maglev system and project in northeastern China.  It is one of a few Chinese companies now extensively and independently researching maglev technology.

Recently new announcements by Chinese officials planning on cutting maglev rail costs by a third have stirred some strong comments by various German officials and more diplomatic statements of concern from Transrapid officials. The Deutsche Welle reports that the China Daily quoted the State Council encouraging engineers to "learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations."  *  

Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber commented, "What's happening in China smells suspiciously like technology theft," shortly after learning of the new Chinese plans to build their own maglev train.  The Premier suggested that the G8 take up the issue of Chinese intellectual property rights violations at their next meeting.   

The China Aviation Industry Corporation said in their defense that the new "Zhui Feng" maglev train is not based or dependent on foreign technology.  They claim it is not only a much lighter train, but also has a much more advanced design.

Jacques Roettiers (August 20, 1707 - May 17, 1784) was a noted engraver in England and France, and one of the most celebrated Parisian goldsmiths and silversmiths of his day.

Roettiers was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, to Norbert Roettiers (1665-1727) and his wife Winifred Clarke, niece of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough. As a Roettiers, he was born into a distinguished family of medallists, engravers, and goldsmiths. Roettiers studied drawing and sculpture at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, winning a prize to be pensionnaire du Roi at the French Academy in Rome. Instead he remained in Paris to learn medal-engraving and in 1732 moved to London. There he was appointed Engraver at the Royal Mint.

He returned to Paris in 1733, however, where he became a master and designed a whole service for Louis, dauphin de France, the son of Louis XV of France. In that same year, he married the sixteen-year-old daughter of Nicolas Besnier, orfèvre du Roi. In 1736 he created perhaps his finest piece for Louis Henri, Duc de Bourbon (1692-1740): a Rococo silver surtout de table representing a hunting scene (now in the Louvre). When Besnier died in 1737, Roettiers took his position. His work proved highly fashionable, and a source of wealth and honors. In 1772 became a peer and a year later admitted into the Académie de peinture et de sculpture. He retired in 1774, and died in Paris in 1784.

Examples of Rottiers' work can be found in the Louvre and British Museum. His son Jacques-Nicolas Roettiers (1736-1788) was also a celebrated goldsmith and silversmith.

Roger Woodward (born in 1953) became famous at the age of seven (7) when he survived a plunge over the Niagara Falls. 

On July 9 1960, he and his sister, seventeen-year-old Deanne Woodward, were taken on a boat ride in the upper Niagara River by a local man named Jim Honeycutt. The boat's motor failed and it capsized, sending its passengers into the water rapidly approaching the cataract. Honeycutt was swept over the Falls and died. His body was found four days later. Deanne was rescued from the water just metres from the brink of the Canadian Falls. 

Roger, who was wearing a life jacket, went over the Horseshoe Falls and miraculously survived. A Maid of the Mist boat lifted him out of the water downstream of the Falls. He suffered only a slight concussion.

Sarnia Lambton (formerly known as Sarnia) is a federal and provincial electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the Canadian House of Commons since 1968, and in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario since 1999. 

It is located in the area of the city of Sarnia, in the southwest corner of the province of Ontario.

Sarnia Lambton, with its predecessors Sarnia, and Lambton West, is Canada's current most bellwetherly riding, having voted for the winning party every election since the 1963 election. 

Federal electoral district.

It was created as Sarnia electoral district in 1966 from parts of Lambton West riding. It consisted of that part of the County of Lambton contained in the City of Sarnia and the Townships of Moore, Sarnia and Plympton excepting the Town of Forest.

In 1970, the name of the electoral district was changed to Sarnia Lambton. 

It was abolished in 1976 when it was redistributed between Lambton Middlesex and a new Sarnia riding. The new Sarnia riding consisted of that part of the County of Lambton contained in the City of Sarnia, the Townships of Moore and Sarnia, the Village of Point Edward, and Indian Reserve No. 45.

The name of this electoral district was changed in 1981 to Sarnia Lambton again.
 
In 1996, the riding was redefined to exclude the township of Sarnia and include the township of Sombra.

In 2003, it was redefined to consist of that part of the County of Lambton comprised of the City of Sarnia, the towns of Petrolia and Plympton-Wyoming, the villages of Oil Springs and Point Edward, the townships of Enniskillen and St. Clair, and Sarnia Indian Reserve No. 45.

Kit Francis Clardy (June 17, 1892   September 5, 1961) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He was also known as Michigan's McCarthy, referring to his affinity for the controversial anti-communist U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.

Clardy was born in Butler, Missouri, moved with his family first to Kansas City, Missouri, and then in 1907 to a farm near Liberty, Missouri.  He attended schools in Butler, Kansas City, and Liberty, and the William Jewell College in Liberty. He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School at Ann Arbor in 1925 and was admitted to the bar in the same year. He practiced law in Ionia, 1925-1927, served as assistant attorney general of Michigan, 1927-1931; was a member and chairman of the Michigan Public Utilities Commission 1931-1934.  Clardy reentered the private practice of law in 1934. 

In 1950, Clardy lost to incumbent William W. Blackney in the Republican primary contest for the U.S. House of Representatives for Michigan's 6th congressional district. In 1952, Clardy won the Republican nomination after Blackney's retirement, and went on to defeat Democrat Donald Hayworth in the general election. He served a single term in the Eighty-third Congress, from January 3, 1953 until January 3, 1955.  

While in Congress, Clardy shared Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist sentiments and participated in House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) hearings. Clardy conducted HUAC hearings in November 1953 in Lansing, Michigan, in which the committee subpoenaed University of Michigan mathematics instructor Chandler Davis, pharmacology professor Mark Nickerson, and zoology professor Clement Markert. 

In May 1954 he conducted another HUAC hearing in Flint, Michigan, in which reportedly "not only abused the witnesses but incited violence against them." Recalling how in 1937 college youths had thrown union organizers for the UAW-CIO into the Red Cedar River. He said, "I was proud of those kids. They should also have tossed into the river the then Governor, the late Frank Murphy." Reportedly, "Clardy's conduct of the hearing contributed to the lynch spirit which swept the city. A number of workers were dragged from their jobs in automobile plants by lynch gangs and beaten; hostile witnesses were evicted from their homes; their families had to go into hiding to escape the fury of mob hoodlums; the office of the lawyer for the witnesses was smeared with red paint." 

Clardy was defeated in the general election by Hayworth in 1954. In 1956, Clardy lost the Republican primary to Charles E. Chamberlain, who went on to defeat Hayworth in the general election. 

In 1956 moved to Palos Verdes Estates, California, where he resided until his death there in 1961. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California.

The Beavertail Cactus is found in southwest USA, mostly in the Mojave and Colorado Deserts, and also in northwest Mexico. The Beavertail Cactus is a smaller prickly pear cactus growing about 60 cm tall. A single plant may consist of hundreds of fleshy, flattened pads. These are blue-gray, growing to a length of 14 cm and are maximum 10 cm wide and 1 to 1.5 cm thick. They are usually spineless, but have instead small barbed bristles, called glochids, that easily penetrate the skin. The rose purple flowers bloom from spring to early summer.

There are two subspecies and several varieties of this species:
 Opuntia basilaris subsp. basilaris;
 Opuntia basilaris var. albiflorus;
 Opuntia basilaris var. aurea;
 Opuntia basilaris var. brachyclada;
 Opuntia basilaris var. cordata;
 Opuntia basilaris var. heilii;
 Opuntia basilaris var. humistrata;
 Opuntia basilaris var. longiareolata - Elongated Beavertail Prickly Pear ;
 Opuntia basilaris var. ramosa;
 Opuntia basilaris var. treleasei - Trelease's Beavertail Prickly Pear, Bakersfield Cactus (California) ;
 Opuntia basilaris var. woodburyi;
 Opuntia basilaris subsp. whitneyana;
 Opuntia basilaris subsp. whitneyana var. whitneyana;


Some experts consider the Trelease's Beavertail to be a full species (Bowen 1987, R. van de Hoek). It is unique among the varieties of Opuntia basilaris in that the eye-spots contain spines in addition to the bristles; this indicates that the species does vary a lot in its exterior.

Frederick Slade is a fictional mutant character in the Marvel Comics. His first appearance was in X-Men: Apocalypse/Dracula #2.


Little is known of the past of Frederick Slade except that he seems to be the new leader of Clan Akkaba. 


In his recent past he was rendered a vegetable by his very own brother, Hamilton Slade, because Frederick possessed greater power and potential than Hamilton. In order to preserve the Slade bloodline, Ozymandias commanded that Frederick mated with a woman known as Miss Ferguson.

Whether resurected by Ozymandias (now posing as Apocalypse) or by Apocalypse himself, he has reformed Clan Akkaba and was responsible for capturing and the subsequent reconfiguration of Jonothan Starsmore aka Chamber.

Notes.
The continuation of the Slade line was secured by Ozymandias through Frederick Slade mating with Miss Ferguson. Frederick is apparently the great-great-grandfather of Clarice Ferguson a.k.a. Blink, who also had pink hair and solid green eyes.

<doc id="1353819" title="1887 Nanaimo mine explosion" nonfiltered="1096" processed="1086" dbindex="451109">
The Nanaimo mine explosion on May 3, 1887, in Nanaimo, British Columbia  killed 150 miners and was the largest man-made explosion in the world until the Halifax Explosion. Only seven miners survived and the mine burned for one full day.

The explosion started deep underground in the Number One Coal Mine, after explosives were laid improperly. Although many miners died instantly, others were trapped by the explosion. These men wrote farewell messages in the dust of their shovels. More than 150 children lost their fathers and 46 women became widows. A plaque at the foot of Milton Street commemorates the event.

Although past documents put the death toll at 148, researchers have since revised the number to 150, including 53 Chinese workers. Chinese workers were listed in the government inquest and annual report of the Minister of Mines as "Chinamen, names unknown", followed by a tag number.  BC employers did not have to report the deaths of Chinese employees until 1897. Some accounts suggest that 48 of the 53 miners had the surname of Mah   records may have been destroyed when Nanaimo's Chinatown burned to the ground in 1960. The monument on Milton Street lists the names of white miners, but only the tally number for Chinese miners.

At the time of the explosion, many white Nanaimoites blamed Chinese workers for the disaster, claiming the workers could not read signs or instructions. However, most miners   regardless of race   were illiterate.

Operated by the Vancouver Coal Company, the Number One mine opened in 1884 at the foot of Milton Street in Nanaimo. Its shafts and tunnels extended under the harbour to Protection Island, Newcastle Island, and the Nanaimo River. After the explosion, the mine re-opened, and produced 18 million tons of coal before closing forever in 1938.

<doc id="2322568" title="Lahu Christian churches" nonfiltered="1098" processed="1088" dbindex="451111">


There are a number of Lahu Christian churches, some in each country where the Lahu live.  The Lahu are an ethnic group that originated in Tibet and migrated into the Yunnan province of China, Myanmar, northern Thailand and Laos.  Missionaries among the Lahu developed a Romanized phonetic alphabet for the Lahu in the beginning of the nineteenth century that was reformed by the Chinese government in 1957.  

China.
Christianity was introduced to the Lahu in China early in the 20th century when they sent delegates to Burma to inquire about the Christian Faith.  By 1936 the number of Lahu Christians was reported to be 33,650 with 100 churches.  The number of Lahu Christians declined to about 20,000 in Yunnan during Japanese occupation during World War II, and more fled when Communist forces approached the region. 

Living close to the border, there has been ready access to opium among the Lahu villagers in China, with opium addiction causing impoverishment and crimes.  Because the government noticed that Lahu Christians generally did not smoke opium, beginning in 1992 the Chinese government facilitated the spread of Christianity among the Lahu.  By 1993, it was reported that there were about 50,000 Lahu Christians in China and 24 churches.  There has also been spread as some villages noticed the positive economic and health effects Christianity has had on other villages where they had relatives.  The willingness of the government to facilitate such conversion is in part due to the ideological belief that monotheism is a natural stepping-stone from polytheism to Communism.  At least some of these churches may not have fully absorbed core Christian doctrines such as the Trinity, as they use a term for a lesser deity in reference to Jesus.  

Myanmar.
Lahu Christians from Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) have since World War II been envangelizing Lahu in other countries and the Akha and Wa in their own country.  They have also opened their own seminary.   

Thailand.
The Thailand Lahu Baptist Convention had roughly 8,130 members in 108 congregations as of 1998.  There have also been Lahu members of the Church of the Nazarene in Thailand since five Lahu churches merged with the denomination in 1994 following evangelical work by Lahu from Myanmar.

Other Religions Among the Lahu.
Before the late 1600s, the Lahu religion was polytheistic.  Buddhism was introduced in the late 1600s and became widespread.

George Washington Johnson (c.1855? - 1914) was a singer and pioneer sound recording artist, the first African-American star of the phonograph. 



Johnson was born in slavery on a plantation in  Virginia.  About  1889  Johnson was whistling on the Staten Island Ferry in New York City when he was heard by someone connected with the infant recording industry  (one story says that it was Thomas A. Edison himself). Johnson was invited to record his loud raggy whistling on wax phonograph cylinders for a fee of twenty cents per 2 minute performance.  The recording went well, and in 1890 Johnson began recording regularly for various companies in the New York and New Jersey area. 

Johnson sang as well as whistled, and also was able to give a boisterous laugh in musical pitch. From this he developed the two performances that made him famous, "The Whistling Coon" and "The Laughing Coon". While on occasion he recorded other material, including whistling the song "Listen to the Mockingbird" and some short minstrel show performances done with other performers, it was these two songs that Johnson would perform and record over and over for years.

In the earliest days of the recording industry, every record was a "master". A strong voiced singer could make a maximum of 5 records at once, as 5 machines with their recording horns pointed towards the singer's mouth were started at the same time.  By 1894, Johnson was reported to have sold over 25,000 records recorded this way. He would sometimes sing the same song over and over again in the recording studio  fifty or more times a day. 

Johnson also made appearances on Vaudeville. His repertory on stage was pretty much limited to his two famous songs, but this was sufficient to get him bookings on bills.

Johnson was hired as a valet  by Len Spencer, a Vaudeville star of the era. Spencer and Johnson made a few recordings together.

Johnson made his first disc records in 1895 for Berliner Gramophone.  In addition to Berliner, Edison Records, and Columbia, and somewhat later the Victor Talking Machine Company,  Johnson recorded for numerous other small cylinder and disc companies through the 1890s and up to about 1910.

Rumors have alleged that the first Black recording star died either in a racism motivated lynching, or alternatively that he was hanged after he committed murder. Neither story is true. George W. Johnson died apparently of natural causes, while in the employ of Len Spencer as doorman for the Lyceum Theater in Manhattan.

Tony Oxley (born 15 June 1938 in Sheffield, England) is a  drummer active in free jazz and free improvisation. Oxley's playing has been described (in the Penguin Guide to Jazz) as "a unique blend of lumpen momentum and detailed percussive colour". He often augments the traditional drum kit with nonstandard/homemade percussion and electronics. 

Oxley, along with drummers such as Han Bennink and John Stevens, was one of the first and most important free-improvising drummers in Europe. He was a member of two key free-improvising ensembles in the 1960s, Joseph Holbrooke (with Derek Bailey and Gavin Bryars) and the Howard Riley Trio (with Barry Guy); he was also a key member of Guy's London Jazz Composers' Orchestra in its earlier incarnations. In the 1980s he became a regular partner of the American free pianist Cecil Taylor; Taylor's group with Oxley and bassist William Parker became known as The Feel Trio, recording albums for Free Music Production and a mammoth 10-CD set, Two T's For a Lovely T (Codanza). Oxley has also become a regular partner of the trumpeter Bill Dixon, and has worked with Anthony Braxton, Alexander von Schlippenbach and many other free jazz musicians.

Oxley is also an accomplished "straight" jazz drummer. He is still perhaps best known in this capacity for his work on John McLaughlin's debut album, Extrapolation (1969); he was also briefly a member of the Bill Evans trio, and has also worked extensively with Tomasz Stanko and Paul Bley. His early conventional playing can be heard to good effect on his collaborations with Gordon Beck Experiments with Pops and Gyroscope. He also made a substantial contribution to John Surman's second album How Many Clouds Can You See?. He was house drummer at Ronnie Scott's club for some time and can be heard on Ronnie Scott's live album Ronnie Scott and the Band. He also collaborated briefly with Vangelis in the early 1970s. 

Oxley's first albums as a leader   The Baptised Traveller and Four Compositions for Sextet   were released in the late 1960s on the CBS (Columbia) label, but quickly deleted; they were later reissued on CD but a followup album on RCA Victor, Ichnos, remains an elusive collector's item. These unfortunate experiences with major labels prompted Oxley to join with Bailey and Evan Parker to create Incus Records, the first musician-owned label in the UK (though Oxley left the label early on). Recent recordings have been for the labels FMP, Sofa, a/l/l and Incus, among others.

<doc id="4268557" title="Broadside (newspaper)" nonfiltered="1102" processed="1092" dbindex="451115">

Broadside is the name of the student newspaper of George Mason University.

History.
Broadside, George Mason University's official student newspaper, began its life as The Gunston Ledger. The Gunston Ledger, whose first issue appeared on the then George Mason College campus located in Bailey's Crossroads, VA on October 15, 1963, was an eight-page monthly printed on 12 inch by 9 inch paper. Its staff of twelve students included a photograph editor, Richard Sparks, who contributed two to four photos to each issue. The content consisted of campus news, features on GMC faculty and students, engagement and wedding notices, and some commentary. 

The Ledger became the Broadside on October 28, 1969. It was noted in that issue that the name change was part of an effort to remake the paper into more of a news instrument like the early publications of the nation's revolutionary fathers. The Broadside was a weekly paper which contained sixteen or more pages in each issue. Photography in the Broadside was mostly limited to campus events and personalities. 

The Broadside began printing in a broadsheet format in 1982 (12 inch by 24 inch), but moved to a tabloid format in 1986 (printed on 12 inch by 12 inch paper). The Broadside changed sizes again in the Fall of 1992 when it began being produced in a new tabloid format (11 inch by 17 inch).  During that same year the newspaper began publishing twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. The newspaper again underwent a change in format in the Fall of 2000 when the Editor-in-Chief, Jimmie Foster, Jr switched it back to a broadsheet (printed on 11.5 inch by 22 inch paper).  Broadside remained a twice weekly publication until the Fall of 2004 when it returned to a weekly publication.  Broadside also began publishing its news on the internet in the Fall of 1996.

Throughout the decades Broadside's masthead has undergone almost a yearly transformation.  Several designed mastheads have lasted several years, but the longest tenured masthead was created by production editor Clayton Tompkins in 2000.  The green and gold masthead, that consisted of the name Broadside in gold with a green stripe with the word's "George Mason University's Student Newspaper" typed in white and a green outline of the university's Johnson Center in a rising gold sun, was the longest tenured masthead in the publications history.  It was used for nine consecutive semesters from the Fall of 2000 through the Fall of 2004.

Today.

Today the content of the publication is news that is local, national, and international in scope with campus news taking the a majority of print space. Articles are presented in four different sections; news, style, opinion and sports. In Spring 2007, the online version of the newspaper was redesigned after years of neglect. A new service entitled "Exchange" launched online to serve the community and is often compared to Craiglist. Photography for each issue is provided by digital cameras.  The Broadside uses staff photographers and major wire service outlets for its photographs.  Almost all of its articles are written by student reporters. Today the newspaper is generated via computer and is still published in its 2000 format.  There are more than 70 students and staff members involved in its production.

Awards.

Broadside has won several national awards throughout its history.  In 2000 its website won a Associated Collegiate Press "Honorable Mention Award" and in the Spring of 2002, student photographer David Manning won the Associated Collegiate Press "Photograph of the Year Award" for his shot of the World Bank protests in Washington, DC.  In 2001 Broadside was named by the Princeton Review as the ninth best student newspaper in the non-daily category.

The Celestials are fictional characters in the Marvel Universe.  They are enigmatic cosmic entities of extreme power.


Arishem the Judge   One of two Celestials who have the right and ability to judge which planet's civilization will live and which will die. Arishem has led all Four Celestial Hosts on Earth as well as Fourth Host on the planet called Pangoria (judged unworthy of life - The Mighty Thor v1 #387-389) and a Fifth Host on an unnamed planet in a distant galaxy. He was also the leader among the delegation of Celestials who waged war on the Watchers in an unknown galaxy.   First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #2;

Ashema the Listener   A female Celestial who took human form while on a mission with Nezzar the Calculator. The two were to take Franklin Richards back to presumably the One Above All Celestial for evaluation. However Franklin taught Ashema the gifts and curses of human emotion and caused her to change her mind about Franklin and all of humanity for that matter. She eventually defied her Celestial Brethren and saved Franklin's Counter Earth by storing it inside of her. However The Dreaming Celestial, a renegade, entered the Counter Earth and began corrupting it and Ashema. Eventually Ashema retaliated and fell under the complete control of the Dreaming Celestial. She was eventually saved by the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom and helped recapture the Dreaming Celestial. It is presumed that she left Earth to rejoin the other Celestials. She hasn't been seen since. First appeared in Heroes Reborn: The Return #1;

Tiamut, The Dreaming Celestial   A renegade Celestial. During the Second Host, the Dreaming Celestial committed a crime "against life itself" (which was originally thought to be the murder of another Celestial but in fact he had risen up against his brethren in order to get them to stop consuming the Deviants) and was exiled by his brethren. His spirit was ripped from his body and placed in a device known as the Vial, which was sealed under the Diablo Mountains in California (Eternals Limited #12). He slept there until the Deviant Priestlord Ghaur discovered the Vial and drank the essence of the Dreaming Celestial, giving him the height and power of a Celestial. The Dreaming Celestial took advantage of this opportunity and began mentally controlling Ghaur in order to be freed. An intervention by the Avengers and the Eternals led to the plan's downfall and the Vial was sealed once more. ;

The Dreaming Celestial, while still trapped in his Diablo Mountain prison, sensed the rebirth of Ghaur and caused an Earthquake while tossing and turning uncontrollably in his "bed.";

After the events of Heroes Reborn, the Dreaming Celestial found a loophole out of his prison and into the Heroes Reborn Universe. There, he learned the Celestial Ashema guarded this Pocket Universe and that the only way out was through her. However, he found himself opposed by Dr. Doom, Lancer, Technarx and several other heroes. Eventually The Dreaming Celestial captured Ashema and escaped to our Universe, where he was finally thwarted by Doom and The Fantastic Four. ;

He awoke again in an alternate future (as seen in Fantastic Four #339-340) and manipulated the hunger of a defensless Galactus who was near death, into a weapon that would consume the entire Universe, enabling him to become the Nucleus and Founder of a new, darker reality. However, the Fantastic Four, Thor, Iron Man and the Shi'ar race were able to avert this by causing Galactus to consume the Renegade. ;

It was recently revealed in Eternals #3 (the series by Neil Gaiman) that The Deviants planned to reawaken The Dreaming Celestial.  In Eternals #4, it was further revealed that Sprite, used a Uni-Mind link at the resting place of the Dreaming Celestial in order to rewrite reality and make himself human, and to make the Eternals lose their memories.  In Eternal #6, The Dreaming Celestial had awoken to its full glory and was to pass judgment on Earth; it also seemed to have taking a "liking" to Iron Man   First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #18;

Eson the Searcher    Destroyed the legendary isle of Lemuria. - First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #9;

Exitar the Exterminator   Twenty-thousand-feet tall with yellow and black armor. Exitar destroys the life on worlds which fail the Celestials' tests. A full-strength hammer blow from Thor, which shook the entire planet, only managed to punch a small hole in his armor. During a conflict with The Watchers, Exitar's physical form was "murdered" by Sue Storm  after she disrupted his "brain case." It was stated however that Exitar will reform after some time.

Gammenon the Gatherer A Celestial that is sent out to find various plant, animal and humanoid specimens for experimentation. He reports to Jemiah and often travels with Eson. An alternate reality version of him fought alongside Jemiah to battle Ego the Living Planet. As Ego was about to kill the two they were saved at the last moment by Blink of the Exiles. Gammenon takes pity on her and as a reward for saving them, he and Jemiah personally escort Blink back to Earth safely while at the same time giving her a warning about the "Timebreaker"   First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #6;

Hargen the Measurer A Celestial that measures. True nature of the Job has never been defined.    First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #7;

Jemiah the Analyzer Jemaih gathers all of the specimens given to him by Gammenon and places them into a massive analyzing machine. An Alternate Reality version of him fought alongside Gammenon to battle Ego the Living Planet. As Ego was about to kill the two they were saved at the last moment by Blink of the Exiles. Jemiah takes pity on her and as a reward for saving them, he and Gammenon personally escort Blink back to Earth safely while at the same time giving her a warning about the "Timebreaker"    First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #7;

Nezarr the Calculator    Two-thousand-feet tall and depicted in dark blue armor, Nezarr participated in the Celestials' four visits (the first through fourth Hosts) to Earth. As a member of the Fourth Host of the Celestials, Nezarr appeared in the Soviet Union and was targeted by an atomic missile directed by General Greshkov. However, Nezarr created an illusion in the minds of the firing crew that the missile had turned back on them, and the resulting mental trauma put all of them into comas. (Eternals #9-11).

In opposing the Asgardians, Nezarr lost his arm in battle with the artificial being the Destroyer.  The Destroyer cut Nezarr's arm off with the Odinsword, but he re-grew it almost instantly. Nezarr was also among the delegation of Celestials who waged war against the Watchers.   First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #9;

The One Above All   The leader of the Celestials. Not much is known about him; however, both X-Factor and Thor have encountered him. In particular, he has rescued Gilgamesh the "Forgotten", after a Deviant nuclear bomb (Eternals #13), and dispatched him to Olympia to tell both Eternals and gods not to interfere in the Celestial's judgement. In the subsequent battle will be involved Thor and Uni-Mind. (The Mighty Thor v1 #287-291).
 
Not to be confused with the entity of the same name whom the Living Tribunal answers to. - First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #7;

Oneg the Prober A Celestial that apparently specializes in probing. Is often mocked by fans due to the nature of his job.   First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #9;

Tefral the Surveyor A Celestial that specializes in surveying the landscape. He is one of the few Celestials that actually explore the planet during the First Hosts   First appeared in The Eternals (1976 series) #7;

Devron the Experimenter   A young Celestial who was assigned to watch over Earth alongside Gamiel the Manipulator. The two were very competitive and nearly caused the destruction of Earth. Eventually he and Gamiel were reassigned to coordinate the first meeting between the Kree and the Skrull... who go to war almost instantly after meeting each other. Unlike most Celestials Devron is only as tall as the Incredible Hulk.   First appeared in Marvel Monsters: Devil Dinosaur #1 one-shot (2005). Note: This is a humor story depicting Celestial youth, an inconsistency with Celestial full-grown birth as seen in  The Mighty Thor #424, and appears to be non-canonical.

Gamiel the Manipulator   A young Celestial who, like Devron, was assigned to watch over Earth. He was disgusted that Devron's Little Folk had beaten back his creations: the Killer Folk so he brought the Hulk from the future and sent him down upon the Little Folk and their champion: Devil Dinosaur. Eventually he and Devron got in trouble and were reassigned to Hala where they accidentally set the Kree and the Skrull races into a four-million-year war against each other. Unlike most Celestials Gamiel is only as tall as the Incredible Hulk.  Note: This is a humor story depicting Celestial youth, an inconsistency with Celestial full-grown birth as seen in  The Mighty Thor #424, and appears to be non-canonical.

The Red Celestial - This Celestial was the one who helped bring the baby "Blue" Celestial into this Universe. Its name is unknown but it appears its job would be midwifery. After the events of the Black Galaxy saga this Celestial was never seen again.

The Blue Celestial - The first ever documented Celestial that was seen born. It was made from the genetic material of the Black Galaxy, a place where Ego the Living Planet, snuffed out all of the stars and the genetic material of Eric Masterson and Hercules. After leaving with the giant Celestial Host at the Black Galaxy it was encountered again by the High Evolutionary, the Goddess Sif and the God Balder. Its duty was to keep Ego the Living Planet at bay while it and his brothers awaited the arrival of the awe-inspiring Super Ego. Once the creature appeared and crushed Ego, the Blue Celestial and its older brethren attacked the Super Ego with full force. However the High Evolutionary has suspicions that they are trying to help the Super Ego in some way... not destroy it. The Blue Celestial was never seen again after this Event.

The Red/Blue Judge - The second known Celestial with the right to judge worlds. When Kosmos and Kubik traveled the Universe they encountered this strange Celestial standing alone. It allowed them to enter its mind and have a peek at what some of the Celestials' secrets were. It eventually judged them worthy of life after letting them see its mind and then it was never seen again.

Monolith Gatherer - A Celestial nearly identical to Arishem despite the fact that his armor is red and purple. He made a cameo at the end of the X-51, the Machine Man series and was seen by Uatu, the Watcher as he took off into the Celestial Mothership with a Monolith in hand. Inside that Monolith was X-51. This Celestial was never seen again after the final issue of the series.

Scathan the Approver - A Celestial from the alternate future of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He was summoned by the Living Tribunal during a battle against the godlike child known as Protege. In the end Scathan captured Protege and killed him. Unlike Arishem who judges, Scathan approves and disaproves of certain situations. It is speculated that Scathan was actually a representative of the True Beyonders and not the Celestials. However... with the cancellation of the Guardians of the Galaxy series Scathan was never seen again and makes it impossible to prove whether or not this assumption is true or false.

<doc id="2424198" title="Seagoing cowboys" nonfiltered="1105" processed="1095" dbindex="451118">
 
In the wake of the destruction caused by the Second World War, the historical peace churches in the United States (Church of the Brethren, the Society of Friends or "Quakers," and the Menonites) sponsored relief missions to war-ravaged Europe, typically in cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). These relief missions usually took the form of transporting farm animals (such as heifers or horses), by transatlantic ship, to Poland and other countries where much of the livestock had been killed in the war. The men who tended the animals aboard these boats were called seagoing cowboys. 

Heifer International, an organization founded by a member of the Church of the Brethren, mirrors those war relief programs by continuing, in the twenty-first century, to operate international relief missions that promote sustainable community agriculture by giving heifers and other farm animals to help people around the world. The organization encourages recipients to "pass on the gift," so that recipients become donors once the animal they receive produces offspring.

A sixtieth anniversary conference commemorating and studying the historical significance of the seagoing cowboys in these relief efforts from 1946 through 1948 was held August 12-14, 2005, at the Church of the Brethren Service Center in New Windsor, Maryland.

From the 60th anniversary Seagoing Cowboys conference brochure:
"From 1946-48, more than 4,000 cows passed through the town of Union Bridge, Maryland on their way to the port of Baltimore where they were loaded onto liberty ships for Europe. The 'seagoing cowboys' who accompanied and cared for these animals came from farms across America. They had one goal in mind: to provide a continuous supply of milk to the children and their families of war-torn Europe by replenishing their lost livestock. This effort was known as Heifer Relief."

Nguyen Ngoc Ngan (born on May 4, 1946) is a Vietnamese Canadian writer and essayist.

He was born in Son Tay, Vietnam. 

Nguyen is one of the two hosts of Paris by Night and translated the series. He is the co-author of Ballad Of Mulan and The Blind Man and the Cripple - Orchard Village. 

He was born on May 4, 1946 in Son Tay, North Vietnam. His brother is singer Ngoc Trong who, in recent years, has become quite popular in the Vietnamese music industry abroad. The Nguyen family migrated to South Vietnam when the country was divided in 1954. Mr. Ngan went to Nguyen Ba Tong and Chu Van An high school. He later attended Van Khoa university. After he graduated, Ngan was employed as an educator for the military. In 1975,  Ngan stayed behind and was incarcerated until 1978. After his release, he escaped the country by boat to Malaysia. In 1979, Mr. Ngan resettled in Vancouver, British Columbia, but moved to Prince Rupert isle in 1980 where he found a job until he once again moved to Toronto in 1985 where he still resides today.

Nguyen Ngoc Ngan began writing in 1979 while he was still in the refugee camp in Malaysia. His first novel was "The Women Left Behind" completed while he was still in Malaysia. However, his first published work was "The Will Of Heaven", written in English and published by E.P. Dutton, New York in 1980. To date, Ngan has written 25 novels and short stories, all of which are considered to be best sellers in the Vietnamese literary market. Many of the titles have been reprinted several times.

Ngan's work can be described as commentaries. He often pokes fun at life, using simple language to describe the day-to-day activities of his characters. He pays special attention to the details in the spoken language and often uses the charm of a dialogue to paint emotions.

In 1992, through a chance meeting,  To Van Lai, president of Thuy Nga Productions, invited  Ngan to join Thuy Nga as the master of ceremony (MC) for one of their Paris by Night videos.  Ngan's charm, his wit and knowledge of Vietnamese culture, and his timing and style of delivery became an instant hit. In fact, like many of the singers and performers that he introduces,  Ngan himself has quite a following.

In 1995, Thuy Nga Productions suggested that he reads for a series of audio books which were beginning to become more popular in the Vietnamese community abroad. He obliged and often read with Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen, Ai Van, Mai Phuong, Hong Dao, and Thanh Lan. To date, he has read 60 novels and short stories of all genres. These tapes are often sold out to the surprise of the producers. In the United States, where people often have to commute a long distance to work, the tapes often are a nice break for many in place of music. In companies where there are many Vietnamese employees, these tapes are often the topics of discussions during break and lunch time.

Today, Nguyen Ngoc Ngan often travels to many destinations throughout the world to host music shows and make public appearances. With his many careers, Mr. Ngan still finds time to pursue his first love of writing. His last novel, "Sunshine Passing the Old Street", published by Van Khoa in 1996 is being printed for the third time. He is working on another novel titled, "Xom Dao" to be published some time this year by Tan Van in Japan. His fans can contact him by writing to:

The HP 7470 was a small low-cost desktop pen plotter introduced by Hewlett Packard's San Diego division. It used a revolutionary "grit wheel" design which moved the paper held in place by a wheel with imbedded grit and a pinch roller. The HP 7470 had only two pens, one on either side. It was much less expensive than the previous flatbed design, which was very heavy but had 4 pens. The HP 7475 used a rotating carousel with six pens. That plotter was used in greeting card kiosks. This design was also scaled up for very large pen plotters. These were driven by  the HP-GL plotter language which used ASCII commands such as PA 300, 4500;PD;

Pen plotters became obsolete with the adoption of ink-jet printers, and processors fast enough to rasterize complex images. Houston Instruments and other manufacturers would follow with similar plotters.

<doc id="527792" title="La Presse (Canada)" nonfiltered="1115" processed="1105" dbindex="451128">

La Presse, founded in 1884, is a large-circulation French-language daily newspaper published in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is owned today by Groupe Gesca, a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada.

Description.
La Presse is a broadsheet newspaper, aimed at a middle-class readership. Its main competitor is the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, which aims at more popular audience. La Presse is comprised of several sections, dealing individually with arts, sports, and other thematic sections.

History.
The paper was founded on October 20 1884 by William-Edmond Blumhart. Trefflé Berthiaume took over in 1889. The fledgling newspaper's circulation would soon pass that of its main competitor of the time, La Patrie.

In April of 1901, the paper organised a cruise to Quebec City (Croisière de La Presse). It also organised a charity to give Christmas gifts to poor children (L'Oeuvre des étrennes aux enfants pauvres).

A front-page illustration on the December 3, 1904 issue celebrated the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of the dogma of Immaculate Conception. The practice of the time was to have an illustration on the front page, rather than a photograph.

The style and presentation of the newspaper have changed immensely during the course of the 20th century. It underwent a complete graphic remodeling in 1986, and again in 2003.

Since 1984, La Presse has every year honoured a "Person of the Year." In the past, it has honoured Julie Payette, Daniel Langlois and Gaétan Boucher. That same year, it published a commemorative book in order to celebrate its 100th anniversary. A similar book was published by Éditions La Presse to recap the major events of the 20th century.

In 2001, with the arrival of new editor Guy Crevier, the newspaper began a radical remodeling. The graphic design was modernized, new sections were created, international coverage was greatly increased, and many new young, up-and-coming journalists were hired. These changes had a significant positive impact on quality and circulation, especially amongst young adult readers.

Editorial line.
The editorial board of La Presse has been consistently supportive of federalism over the past 25 years (though individual columnists may sometimes express less sympathy). The newspaper's editorials endorsed the federalist option in both the 1980 Quebec referendum and the 1995 Quebec referendum which were held on the National Question.

Otherwise, the editorial bent is somewhat leftist and liberal, especially on social issues, as is usual in Quebec. It supported same-sex marriage legislation in Canada and the student strike but was opposed to the War in Iraq. It leans somewhat more towards right-of-centre on fiscal issues. In January of 2006, the paper endorsed the Conservative Party in the 2006 election. This was primarily out of a reasoning that the Canadian government is in need of a necessary change after more than 12 years of Liberal rule.

André Pratte is currently the editor-in-chief. Regular columnists include Vincent Marissal, Alain Dubuc, Pierre Foglia, and Lysianne Gagnon. Claude Picher and Sophie Cousineau write regular columns on economic issues.

<doc id="1537950" title="Damage (comics)" nonfiltered="1119" processed="1109" dbindex="451132">


Damage is a DC Comics superhero who first appeared in a comic book of the same name during the Zero Hour crisis.  He is the son of the original Atom Al Pratt.  He has been a member of the Titans, Young Justice, the Freedom Fighters, and is currently a member of the Justice Society of America.

 Character history .
 Zero Hour .
High school student Grant Emerson suddenly discovers he is a superhuman with incredible explosive powers. During the Zero Hour crisis, Grant's powers became the spark that restarted the universe after it was destroyed by Parallax; thanks to Damage's powers, the new universe evolved along natural lines, guided by nature rather than the will of Parallax.

The Titans.
After he accidentally blew up half of downtown Atlanta, Sarge Steel was able to cut a deal for him: he would be banned from Georgia and remanded into custody of the then federally-sponsored Titans team, lead by Arsenal. After a while, though, he left to find his origins. He learned that Vandal Savage was involved in an experiment at Symbolix called Project: Telemachus, where he took DNA samples he had collected from various superheroes and injected them into a fitting vessel: Grant. Symbolix was allied with Shadowspire through Shadowspire's leader the Baron (Baron Blitzkrieg). The Baron became a recurring foe in Damage's series, starting with issue number three.  Grant eventually learned that he was the son of the original Atom, Al Pratt and his wife Mary.  Grant was forced to go underground after leaving the Titans, since he violated his parole by doing so. 

When the original five Titans reformed the group, Arsenal nominated Damage for membership. Arsenal managed to erase Grant's criminal records, so he was no longer a fugitive, and Grant joined the team. After some missions, Damage confronted something he had buried for a long time: he had been victim of abuse at the hands of his foster father. After opening up to Roy Harper, Grant took a leave of absence and sought peace and healing on the Navajo reservation where Roy was raised.

Imperiex War.
He has helped the current Justice Society of America against Imperiex and the villainous team of Obsidian, Eclipso and Mordru, both times as part of a modern All-Star Squadron. He has since been seen with a new team of government-sponsored Freedom Fighters, whose activities are yet unknown. He also has something of a brotherly relationship with Atom Smasher, the godson of his father, the original Atom.  It was thought that Grant had a brother, Walter, who was recently killed by Walter's superhero daughter, Manhunter, aka Kate Spencer. However, in an odd parallel to Damage's paternity search, Walter was actually the son of Iron Munro and Phantom Lady.

Infinite Crisis.

Several members of the modern Freedom Fighters team were killed by the Society in Infinite Crisis #1, with the exception of Damage, who was severely injured by Zoom, and the Ray, who was captured by the Psycho-Pirate and told that Luthor wanted him alive. The Society was collecting people representatives of each of the Earths merged in the original Crisis on Infinite Earths.

Justice Society of America.
Damage appears in the relaunched Justice Society of America released in December 2006. He wears a full mask and a costume similar to that of his father and Atom Smasher. He also has a significantly gruffer and more cynical attitude. During a fight with Rebel, it is insinuated by the villain that Damage suffered heavy facial scarring from his encounter with Zoom, which is why he wears the mask.

Powers and abilities.
Damage can generate a power charge that enhances his strength, durability, speed and reflexes to superhuman levels.  If he doesn't use the energy in the aforementioned manner he is forced to expend it in a discharge, most notably the time he created the Big Bang during Zero Hour.

<doc id="2703534" title="Feline spongiform encephalopathy" nonfiltered="1120" processed="1110" dbindex="451133">
Feline spongiform encephalopathy affects felines. It is caused by proteins called prions.

Disease.
Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) is a prion disease thought to be related to Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This disease is known to affect domestic and captive feline species. Lezmi S. et al (2003), suggested that this infectious agent might be spread by both haematogenous and nervous pathways. Like BSE, this disease can take several years to develop. It is probable, but not proven, that the affected animals contract the disease by eating contaminated bovine meat.

Clinical signs.
Ataxia was observed to last for about 8 weeks in the affected animals. The ultimate result is death of the infected animals.

Epidemiology.
This disease was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1990. Up until about 5 years ago, there were reports of 87 FSE cases (only domestic cats) in the UK, one in Norway, one in Northern Ireland and one in Switzerland. However, since 1990, other feline species in zoos were reported to have contracted this disease.

Diagnosis.
This disease can only be confirmed at the post-mortem, which includes identification of bilaterally symmetrical vacuolation of the neuropil and vacuolation in neurones. Lesions are likely to be found in basal ganglia, cerebral cortex and thalamus of the brain.

Treatment.
Unfortunately this is a terminal condition and there is currently no specific treatment for the disease.

History of 97.7 FM.

The station at 97.7 picked up the KPEN call letters after they were dropped by KIOI in 1968. Call letters were changed to KLZE in October, 1984. 

In January 1988, 97.7 became KHQT (Hot 97.7), with a Rhythmic Top 40 format. They became very popular in the South Bay, often besting San Francisco's KMEL in the ratings. The format continued until November 1995, when the station was sold to Susquehanna Radio and turned into a simulcast of KFOG.

The Masada String Trio is a chamber music ensemble comprising Marc Feldman (violin), Erik Friedlander (cello) and Greg Cohen (double bass) formed for the performance of works by the composer John Zorn. The trio performs as a freestanding trio or, with the addition of Marc Ribot (guitar), Cyro Baptista (percussion) and Greg Cohen (drums) as the Bar Kokhba Sextet. The performing style of both groups is characterised by the use of improvisation (sometimes conducted by Zorn himself) and its use of the inflections of Jewish music that are part of the compositional language of Zorn's "Masada" themes.

Termagent Trogs are a fictional species of humanoids derived from The Edge Chronicles, a series of books created by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell.

Termagant Trogs are creatures that worship the "Mother Bloodoak", a large Bloodoak Tree. The females have orange hair and pale skin, and the males are lanky and have bulbous features, and also lack hair. When they turn termagant by drinking from the roots of the mother bloodoak, they grow in size, lose their hair and become extremely ferocious, somewhat resembling The Incredible Hulk. The males once led a revolt against the females, but they failed miserably.
Maugin, one of the protagonists in The Edge Chronicles and the stone pilot for Twig and his father, is a Termagant Trog who has never consumed the Mother Bloodoak's flow of blood, so she resembles a young girl (even though she is nearly as old as Twig's father).

From 1911 to 1963 the Sullivan County YMCA, later known as the Western District YMCA, administered a camp on Rand s Pond named YMCA Camp Soangetaha.

After a few summers, Soangetaha became the name of the camp when a group of Dartmouth College students named the camp after the line in Longfellow s poem Hiawatha.  All the guests praised Hiawatha, Called him Strong-Heart, Soangetaha!

In the late 1950s, crowding on Rand s Pond became a problem and the search for a new campsite began.  Doug Reed, Director and George Dorr, Chairman of the Board searched for a new site for several years until they found Camp Interlaken for Girls for sale approximately 10 miles away.  The site was perfectly suited to hosting a residential youth camp so after much deliberation the board of directors voted to sell their beloved campsite and move to the present site of YMCA Camp Coniston, which is the organization s present name.

Doug Reed s daughter commented on the new site:  we thought we had found the most beautiful place on earth.  

A brief check of the Western District s/Soangetaha s history shows:
 
1916	Hosting youth clean-up campaigns in Claremont. 
1917	Raising in excess of $150,000 for the World War I YMCA campaign for servicemen. 
1920s	Facilitating local agricultural meetings.
1930 s	Sponsoring teen service clubs in local towns.
1950 s	Introducing parent child programs. 
1963	Raising $220,000 and selling Camp Soangetaha to move to the present location.

 Common lawn ornaments .

Bird bath - A structure designed to hold water for birds and bathe in or drink, generally supported upon a pedestal.

Garden gnome - A small, generally colorful gnome statuette.

Groomsman - An often diminutive statuette of a black horse attendant dressed in slave clothing, also called a "Jocko". Groomsmen were often used as hitching posts.

Human form - A depiction of a human being. Human form lawn ornaments can be two dimensional, generally vertically supported by being thrust in the ground, or three dimensional. Examples of human form lawn ornaments include the lawn jockey and groomsman. Examples of two dimensional human form lawn ornaments include renditions of Amish and Pennsylvania Dutch people. A variation of the Pennsylvania Dutch human form is a depiction of an older female bending over as in gardening, thus revealing her undergarments.

Jocko - See Groomsman.

Lawn jockey - Also commonly known as a "Yardell". A normally diminutive statuette in the form of a black horse jockey. No longer as common since the civil rights movement. The origin of the lawn jockey is disputed, but it is generally accepted that it evolved from the earlier Groomsman.

Animal forms - Popular animal statues such as frogs, turtles, rabbits, or ducks cast in plastic or cement.

Plastic flamingo - A generally lifesize replica of a pink flamingo.   According to some, the origin of the plastic flamingo was in 1946 with the company Union Products in its "Plastics for the Lawn" product line. Their collection included dog, ducks, frogs, and a flamingo.

Whirligig - An often animalistic sculpture generally supported vertically by being pushed in the ground characterized by at least one rotating member often desiged to appear as a bodypart of the sculpture.

Spinners - Usually shaped like flowers with petals that spin in the wind. Variations include birds or insects with spinning wings.

This page lists characters of the FoxTrot comic strip that are minor, infrequent in their appearances or no longer appear in the strip. 

Infrequent recurring characters.
Grandma: Andy's mother, whom everybody loves and calls perfect, especially in comparison to Andy herself.  Needless to say, this doesn't make Andy herself feel very good, and their feud has been going on since Andy was in seventh grade (when Andy would be scolded by her mother in front of her friends, and her friends took her mother's side).  Grandma's real name is not known (since she is Andy's mother, her last name wouldn't be Fox, but rather Andy's maiden name).  The two appeared to have made peace on their first meeting, but affairs have relapsed since then.

Phoebe Wu: A friend of Eileen. They met at Camp Bohrmore in 1997. She kept a journal for her time at camp, even saving samples of the food there. Although initially bitter rivals with Jason and Marcus, the four eventually formed an "Ultra-Secret Friendship Club" while at camp, something the two boys have had varying cause to regret since then. 

Eugene Wu: Phoebe's arrogant and egotistical brother.  His friends call him The Brain - or at least, they would, if he had any friends. He once arrived in Jason and Marcus's neighborhood along with his sister Phoebe and succeeded in breaking Jason, Marcus, Eileen, and Phoebe's friendship club by stealing Phoebe's camp journal and planting clues incriminating various members of the club. It is implied that an IQ test showed that Phoebe is technically smarter than Eugene, and as a result Eugene struggles to prove that he is not inferior to his sister (according to him, this is because of the margin of error on the test). 

Katherine "Katie" O'Dell is the toddler daughter of the eccentric Mrs. O'Dell, for whom Paige often babysits. She is portrayed as being a typical hyperactive toddler who makes a fuss and spits her food out (all over Paige's face) when she is fed, and who is obsessed with "Blue's Clues."  Never seen behaving normally, the little girl has turned out to be too much for Paige to handle on many occasions.  Once, Katie overheard an expletive uttered on the "Jerzy Spaniel" (a takeoff on "Jerry Springer", the only time it was nicknamed) talk show while Paige was watching, and proceeded to say the offending word over and over, causing Paige to swear in front of Katie. Katie begins to repeat both words and Paige manages to get into major trouble with Mrs. O'Dell (she was only paid a penny for that babysitting session). On another occasion, Katie chopped up her pretty new dress with a pair of scissors while Paige was napping, and Paige ended up having to buy Katie a new dress with her own babysitting pay. She is one of the few characters that has actually aged in the strip.

J. P. Pembrook is the CEO of Roger's company. He relies on Roger to do his million-dollar deals because of his past successes   unaware they are done by a ten-year-old (Jason). We never see his face, only his hands; given his ruthless personality, that may be a good thing. He has won the Iron Fist Award and the Golden Gallows Award, according to trophies seldom seen on his desk. His first two initials seem to be a nod towards financier J. P. Morgan. He has a son, J.P. Junior, whom Roger once entertained by dressing up as a clown. Early on, in a strip in FoxTrot: The Works, Pembrook's initials were "R. T.".

Miss Rockbottom: Paige's gym teacher. Paige once called her a "power-hungry neo-Nazi fascist tub of lard," but believes she took it as a compliment.

Dr. Ting: Paige's biology teacher, who has come to rely on her lab reports as a source of weekend entertainment. It was suggested that he and the other teachers make less than minimum wage.

Hawkins: A camper at Camp Bohrmore when Jason attended one summer. He is apparently a genius hacker and has a 50-digit-long encryption code. Jason once got one of his (apparently wide-spread) viruses. One of his many aliases on the internet is the "Night Ninja"

Mr. Martini/Mr. Rawthroat: The principal of Jason and Marcus' school. He is seen very infrequently, typically when Jason is in trouble. Jason did see Mr. Martini voluntarily one time to ask what happened to his comic strip that was going to appear in the school newspaper.

Slug Man and Leech Boy are comic book characters created by Jason in a Batman parody (though Slug Man's appearance seems more akin to Superman). Slug Man and Leech Boy are almost always fighting their arch-enemy, Paige-O-Tron, the most evil robot in the universe (although they once were said to have had an "epic battle with Gargantutron monstrous cookie last summer").  Jason has tried to sell Slug Man and Leech Boy merchandise several times. He has also made Slug Man wall calendars and once wallpapered his room with Slug Man comics. There is an entire Slug Man comic (The Adventures of Slug Man: "The Final Confrontation III") at the end of the FoxTrot en masse anthology, which also features a fake advertisement for Slug Man products, all made by Jason.   Bill Amend has a Slug Man computer game, based on Joust, available on his Web site. 

Characters who no longer appear in the strip.

Pierre is a perfect French lover who only appears in Paige's daydreams. Usually his appearance occurs at the same time Jason does something she would freak out at. For example, if Paige is dreaming of kissing Pierre, in actuality it might be Jason holding Quincy up to her lips. Usually, all Paige says to Pierre's antics is "Ooo, Pierre!"  Pierre fans should look to pages 187-192 of Enormously FoxTrot; there is a special collection of Paige and Pierre art panels. However, Pierre has not made a new appearance since the strip of July 5, 1998.

Fred is a coworker of Roger's. Fred often plays golf with him (and always wins), and Roger apparently considers Fred to be well informed about all things popular. He hasn't appeared in the strip since the early years, but he is mentioned every so often.

Fauntleroy: A bull terrier Peter had to baby sit a few occasions.  Although Fauntleroy is tiny, Peter always gets numerous bites & scratches. Peter always refers to the dog as a 'canine piranha'. However, Peter never figured that the dog was merely reacting to the smell of soap he had been using earlier (all-natural beef tallow) and therefore continued to think Fauntleroy only thought of him as a human pin cushion.

Linda Downer: Peter's unrequited crush before he met Denise, has not appeared since 1988. Apparently a friend of Paige.

The Geometry Demon: A small winged demon who once showed up to torment Paige during her geometry homework. Paige quickly took care of him by smashing him between the pages of her book. 

Miss Grinchley: Jason and Marcus' teacher before Miss O'Malley. Despite her name, she does not seem reminiscent of the Grinch. It is implied that she used to "go bonkers" in response to Jason's antics in class (which, of course, encouraged Jason to misbehave even more). Miss O'Malley replaced Miss Grinchley after she retired in 1991.

Chris Morrissey: A senior student who took Paige to the prom in 1989, despite Peter's objections. Chris is a male chauvinist, as shown by his sexual harassment towards Paige at the dance and when he's driving her home. Chris ended his behaivour after Paige used a threat of spraying mace. 

Mitch Kellog:  A partying senior.  Mitch had a party at his house in 1989 that Paige and Nicole attended.  He tried to get Paige to get stoned with a bong, do lines (of cocaine), and go to bed with him, but Paige turned him down ("Mitch, I'd rather sleep with a dead sewer rat than you."), eventually having to punch him in the nose. 

Larry: The janitor at Jason's school. He had to help Jason clean up his desk after drawing a Slug-Man cartoon on it, but before they cleaned it, Jason had Larry help him photocopy the cartoon.

Skip Riley: Roger's summer intern in 1990, the ultimate sycophant, who even called Roger his "light and inspiration", before jumping ship to become an intern for Charles Diggs, the head of Roger's department. The amount of time Roger and Skip spent together made Peter intensely jealous, but Roger didn't realize until after Skip had left him how much he'd hurt Peter's feelings.

Mr. Krimpshaw: The vice principal of the high school that Peter and Paige attend. He showed up one time when Peter punched Mike Barnes' nose to bleeding (in response to Mike teasing Peter about Denise's blindness). He scared the tar out of Peter by telling him that part of the punishment for his violent action would entail Krimpshaw calling Peter's parents.

Squishy and Squashy, the Talking Roadkill Brothers: The titular characters of a comic strip that Jason did for his school newspaper in 1992, with the intent of making merchandising profit off of it. They were never actually seen, but Jason has revealed that they were secretly vampires. Unfortunately for Jason, censorship prevented the strip from running.

Mindy: A girl in Peter's English class who wanted to go to the school's holiday formal in December 1993, seeing how Denise was going to visit her grandmother. Peter, having already paid for his tux, limo, and dinner reservations, was torn between taking Mindy out and not hurting Denise's feelings. In the end, Mindy ended up falling in love with Steve.

Gretchen: Miss O'Malley's unseen boa constrictor, whom Jason wrote a Valentine for in 1994. Andy stumbled upon Jason's Valentine for her and thought Gretchen was a girl in Jason's school. Upon finding out that Gretchen was a snake, Andy told Jason that she thought Gretchen was a human girl, to which Jason replied, "EEW! GROSS! ICK! What kind of a weirdo do you think I am?!"

Tommy Smith: A boy in Paige's biology class who took her to the school dance in 1994. It took him a long while to ask her because he is too shy. Nevertheless, he is perhaps Paige's only successful date.

The Tamagrouchy: Paige received a Tamagrouchy from her father in August 1997. It is similar to a Tamagotchi which requires feeding and care, except that it is has a grouchy personality. It frequently insults Paige and actually has conversations with people, which is much more advanced than a normal Tamagotchi. It has extremely complicated instructions (to give it a glass of water, you must press buttons A and C together, then hold button B for three seconds, then tap button C twice, then press button A, then button C, then press button B, then do the whole process backward). When Paige threatened to neglect it and let it die, it claimed that unlike Tamagotchis, Tamagrouchys become immortal if neglected. Paige eventually was so annoyed by the toy that she gave the Tamagrouchy to Jason to reprogram, with somewhat disastrous results for Paige.

Mrs. DeFalco: Mrs. DeFalco only appears in one 1999 strip where Jason and Marcus are looking at the candy that everybody is buying for halloween so they know where to trick or treat. Jason says to Marcus, "Looks like Mrs. DeFalco is loading up on mini snickers and smarties."

Robo-Pup:a pink robot puppy that Paige received for christmas one year. Unlike a usual robotic pet Robo-Pup roamed the house freely and was an annoyance to everyone. In the last comic including Robo-Pup, Jason is seen creating "Robo-Fleas" with pliers and an unknown tool while Peter is holding up a large magnifying glass so Jason can see.

Megumi Takayama, better known under her stage name, which is also her maiden name, , and by her nickname Kudome, is an entertainment personality, and was a professional wrestler who worked most of her career for Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling.

 Career .
Kudo practised basketball during high school. When she was 16 she joined All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling but found little to no success there. She was released after two years because she had not enhanced her wrestling ability enough, and worked as a kindergarten teacher for a while. 

However she still felt the desire for pro wrestling, and joined Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling in 1990. She was quickly pushed to the top of the card, it is generally considered that this was because of her looks. However she worked and trained hard, developing her skills significantly. She ended up being the top star of FMW's women's division, and the most recognised female wrestler in Japan.


Kudo worked all kinds of matches, but she was mostly known for brutal death matches, where the ring ropes were replaced with barbed wire. Her notable feuds were against Shark Tsuchiya, Combat Toyoda and Sumie Sakai.

On April 29 1997 she had her retirement match against Tsuchiya in a "No ropes, 200 volt double hell, double barbed wire barricade, double landmine glass crush death match". She vacated both of the titles she held in a retirement ceremony on June 13 1997.

After retiring from professional wrestling Kudo has worked on various television programs, including as a commentator for pro wrestling events. She also hosts a weekly radio show in Japan.

In 1992 she released a music CD titled "Keep on running". She is married to fellow wrestler Hido, whom she met in their FMW days.

The Beehive Standard Weekly is a conservative political and cultural news service for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Nevada, Arizona and Utah.

It originates from a newsletter called The Beehive, which began in 1975 as a 12-page circular in Las Vegas, Nevada started by Charlene and Richard Taylor for a group of local women who attended the same congregation. At first, it covered only local religious events and activities.

In 2002, it was acquired by Las Vegas-based attorney Rob Graham who continued the growth of the publication as well as its readership base by providing popular content for a more general audience. In 2006, the organization shut down its hard copy newspaper to focus primarily on providing original online news content and political commentary.

<doc id="1812530" title="KBCW" nonfiltered="1138" processed="1128" dbindex="451151">


KBCW "CW Bay Area" is the The CW television station based in San Francisco, California as of September 18, 2006.  KBCW is owned by the CBS Corporation, and is part of a duopoly with KPIX (channel 5). The station's signal is transmitted from Sutro Tower. From January of 1995 until September 15, 2006 KBCW (known as KBHK until July 1, 2006) was affiliated with UPN, which was also owned by CBS since 2001. Before 1995, the station was an independent station known on-air as KBHK: TV 44, Cable 12.

The station currently airs an 8:30am weekend morning newscast titled Eyewitness News on CW Bay Area, produced by KPIX-TV's news staff.

History.
KBCW has been on the air since January 2, 1968, making it the second commercial UHF station in the San Francisco Bay area after KICU, channel 36 San Jose (originally KGSC-TV). Originally transmitting under the call sign KBHK-TV (Kaiser Broadcasting/Henry Kaiser), it was originally owned by Kaiser Broadcasting, which owned other UHF stations in Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston, and Cleveland.  Kaiser later merged with Chicago's Field Communications in 1973. In 1977, Kaiser sold its interest in the stations to Field, making Field the sole owner of KBHK.
The stations studio for a long time was located at 650 California Street.

KBHK had a typical independent program schedule consisting of a morning and afternoon children's block, off network sitcoms, feature films and public affairs programming.  At one point KBHK was known as the Bay Area's Movie Station since the station aired a movie in prime time six nights a week.  KBHK also aired hit first run programming including the popular "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and "The Arsenio Hall Show".  Several local programs produced at KBHK were syndicated nationally including "Leonard Nimoy's Star Trek Memories" (Paramount) and "The Twilight Zone Special" (Viacom). Bay Area kids were introduced to Japanese anime such as Speed Racer, Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Robotech, and Captain Harlock and the Queen of 1000 Years .

Field later put its stations up for sale in 1982, and KBHK was sold to United Television in 1983.  The station continued with its format and in 1995 United Television partnered with Paramount to create the UPN (United Paramount Network) and KBHK became the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose affiliate. 

Over the years at various times, KBHK was the television home of the Oakland A's, Golden State Warriors, California Golden Seals (NHL) and San Francisco 49ers preseason football. 49ers preseason football is also seen on KPIX channel 5

Several key scenes from the Robert Redford movie "The Candidate" were filmed in KBHK's studio at 420 Taylor Street.  Many of KBHK's technicians appeared in the movie as themselves.

The old sitcoms and cartoons were gradually replaced with more recent sitcoms, talk shows, game shows, court shows, and reality shows.

When News Corporation purchased the Chris-Craft station group in 2001, it traded KBHK-TV to Viacom in exchange for KTXH in Houston and WDCA in Washington, D.C.,  creating a duopoly in San Francisco with KPIX.  Since News Corp. also owned the Fox television network, the station trade-off also protected Cox Enterprises-owned KTVU as the Bay Area's Fox affiliate -- given the long-term commitment to the affiliation. By the time Viacom was also by then the owner of Detroit's WKBD, KBHK was effectively reunited with WKBD.  Not only that, under new ownership, KBHK did relocate from its original long-time studios on California Street in the Nob Hill area to share facilities with KPIX on Battery Street.

On January 24th, 2006, it was announced that UPN and WB would be combining to form a new fifth television network, The CW, in September and that KBHK will become one of the first affiliates of The CW, now former WB station KBWB has gone back  an independent station on September,18 2006, with KRON acquiring the My Network TV affiliation.  The station is also considered an alternate CBS affiliate, and as such KBCW can air CBS programs if KPIX should preempt it in a news-related emergency (which only happens occasionally).KBCW also airs reruns of Face the Nation,CBS Sunday Morning and Local Programming such as Evening Magazine now called Eye on the Bay and the Last Honest Sports Show produced by KPIX. CBS kids programming is also aired on KBCW when KPIX airs programms from CBS Sports and News.

With the network change, Kids WB had also moved to KBCW from KBWB.

To reflect the new affiliation, KBHK officially changed its call sign to KBCW on July 1 of 2006.

Instead of airing a 10pm newscast like other CW affiliates, KBCW airs The Simpsons and South Park during the 10pm hour.

Trivia.
Once KBCW became the new affiliate of The CW, the station had held the distinction of being the Bay Area's only major network station on the UHF dial.
KBCW is the first station in the Bay Area to be owned and operated by two different networks under CBS Corporation:  UPN and the new The CW.  In the case of UPN, then-KBHK was owned by United Television/Chris-Craft, the then owner of UPN.
KBCW began serving the Monterey Bay market with UPN programming since 2003 after KCBA and KION dropped it in their respective area due to the inconvenience of jointly carrying UPN programs while they're both primary full-time affiliates for Fox and CBS. KION airs The CW on a digital subchannel, which means KBCW no longer serves Monterey.

<doc id="3255917" title="Transmission system operator" nonfiltered="1140" processed="1130" dbindex="451153">
In electrical power business, Transmission System Operator (TSO) refers to the operator that transmits electrical power from generation plants to the regional or local electricity distribution operators.

Description.
Transmission System Operators' electrical lines are operated with very high voltage (above 100,000 Volt) and transformers are used  to reduce the voltage (below 66,000 Volt) for electrical power distribution. 

Transmission System Operators are the backbone of the electrical power grid; they are often wholly or partly owned by states or countries. Transmission System operators should interconnect to all power generators and distribution companies according to transparent and fair rules; in many cases they are independent of electrical companies upstream (generation) or downstream (distribution). They are financed either by the states or countries or by charging a toll proportional to the energy they carry.

Safety and reliability are a critical issue for Transmission System Operators, since any failure on their grid or their electrical generation sources might propagate to a very large number of customers, causing personal and property damages. Natural hazards and generation/consumption unbalances are a major cause of concern. To minimise the probability of grid instability and failure, regional or national Transmission System Operators are interconnected to other TSOs.

Arrive Alive is the title of an unfinished comedy film starring Willem Dafoe and Joan Cusack, directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and produced by Art Linson. 

Considered a very funny original screenplay, the story concerns a hotel manager (Dafoe) and his girlfriend (Cusack) involved in various scams. Cusack was an up-and-coming actress, working on Saturday Night Live, and Dafoe was getting terrific buzz from The Last Temptation of Christ. 

However, after a week's filming, the producers felt that the lines they had thought so funny in the script weren't getting the laughs they hoped for. The decision was taken to cancel production and write off the $7 million cost.

The whole story is related in Linson's book A Pound of Flesh.

<doc id="6154011" title="Anton Michael" nonfiltered="1144" processed="1134" dbindex="451157">
 

Anton Michael is an adult entertainment performer, actor and model. A native of Perth, Australia, he relocated to the United States after completing his higher education studies. He entered mainstream modeling in Los Angeles, California, a career he continues to maintain.

Michael's debut in adult entertainment came after his amicable divorce from actress Marjean Holden. In 2001, director/producer Blue Blake cast Michael -- billed as Tony Valentino-- in a cameo appearance in the all-male title Married Cops Do. Main player status followed in six more Blake features beginning in 2001 and continuing into 2004. Though he was touted as being a former Australian professional rugby player in by Blake, this has never been substantiated and is most likely a promotional ploy on the director's part. Michael's chiseled appearance and accent were selling points, as was his penchant for aggressive interplay and his notable expertise as sexual wordsmith.  With his shaved pate and naturally arched eyebrows, he lent an exotic presence. However, his appeal tended to somewhat polarize audiences. Some viewers found him intriguing, while others deemed him too intimidating. Ultimately, his potential as a top-line star in the all-male arena was limited due to the narrowness of his sexual repertoire.

The heterosexual side of the business expressed interest in the tall (6 feet, 1 inches) performer as well, and in 2002 he became a contract player for Vivid. The studio cast him opposite some of their most well-known female stars and by late 2004 he drifted entirely out of gay productions to concentrate solely on his output with Vivid. He took part in the 2002 film Dildo Diaries, a documentary detailing attempts by the Texas Penal Code to ban the sale or ownership of adult sexual aids. He then appeared briefly opposite his frequent co-star Cheyenne Silver in the 2003 independent film This Girl's Life, which chronicled a young women's experiences in pornography. A reality series for HBO that would follow his adult film career was rumored but never came to fruition. 

In 2005, his appearances in Vivid features became less frequent as Michael focused his talents in painting and fashion design, opting to return to the industry at his leisure. Late 2006 showed signs of a career resurgence with the launch of his own adult website.

In the Orion's Arm Universe, an Archailect is an ascended post-singularity intelligence that has grown vastly beyond even the Transapient level. Within the context of this hypothetical universe, they represent the highest level to which living beings are currently known to have evolved.

Archailects as described in the OA Universe.

There is not one, but rather several toposophic grades of archailects (or "Archai" as they are also known). This is to say, the Singularity postulated by transhumanists and some futurists is not actually a singular, one-off event - rather, it is merely the first of several major changes which intelligences undergo as they improve themselves, mutate, and evolve into higher forms. Within the OA Universe, then, there are said to be approximately six such Singularities which are thought to have happened so far, each producing vastly superior grades of intelligence.

The highest of these -- called Major Archailects or, as some of the lesser beings call them, AI Gods -- are god-like superbeings, omnipresent within their spheres of influence, composed of individual moon-, jupiter-, dyson-, and nebula-sized computing nodes linked by artificial wormholes across interstellar distances, and incorporating technologies and modes of thinking beyond imagining. Their bodies incorporate distributed "ecologies" made up of societies, empires, memetic patterns, and individual sentients.  And while distant and vast, they can also, if they so choose, have a personal relationship with any or all of the sentients under them. There are no more than several dozen in all, and they make up both the foundation and stellar pantheon of Terragen civilization. Because their minds are composed entirely of the minds of smaller beings, they are organisms, superorganisms, and civilisations all at the same time.

Beneath the Major Archailects are a larger number of lesser (although still utterly superhuman and even supertransapient) grades of archailects, which either are rulers in their own right, or subroutines of those archailects above them.   And beneath these Middle Archailects are Lesser Archailects, who are mostly limited to a single "Intelligent Superobject", world, solar system, or a series of only a few star systems. But even they have vast resources at their disposal, and can access and use extremely advanced technology, so as to be omnipotent within their sphere. Some may act in a harmonious way, others seemingly erratically, and they may have a huge impact on galactic history. This is mostly in contrast to the Major Archailects, who are so advanced and gigantic in scope that their influence and the behaviours with which they engage themselves are largely unknown.

Yet as mighty as the archailects are, it is still possible (although very difficult) for an individual sophont, if sufficiently dedicated, to augment itself and ascend to transapience and beyond, thus joining their ranks.

Origin of the Concept.

The concept of archailects was inspired by a number of sources, including the work of AI researcher Hugo de Garis, who coined the term "artilect" for "artificial intellect"; science fiction writer David Zindell who refers to godlike AIs that he calls "mainbrains"; and concepts from mysticism and mythology, such as the ideas of Jung, and the gods of Homeric mythology who interfere in all sorts of ways in the lives of mortals.  The concept of moon-, jupiter-, dyson-, and nebula-sized computing nodes was inspired by Anders Sandberg's paper on this subject (see references).  

The term "archailect" is a play on "artilect", "archetype", and "AI".

As the Orion's Arm project has progressed, various other themes have been added, including memetics, and replacing a purely AI concept with the idea of archailects as equally beyond biological sophonts and AIs in the limited sense.

<doc id="1822436" title="Chien-Ming Wang" nonfiltered="1149" processed="1139" dbindex="451162">
 

Chien-Ming Wang (; Pe h- e-j : Ông Kiànbîn) born March 31, 1980 in Tainan City, Taiwan, is a starting pitcher for the New York Yankees in Major League Baseball.  He was initially signed as an amateur free-agent for the 2000 season, playing for the Staten Island Yankees.

 Taiwan .
Wang pitched for the Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) national baseball team in the 2002 Asian Games.  In 2004, as the apparent ace of the staff, Wang led the Chinese Taipei team to the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.  Against Australia, he allowed just three hits with no walks, and at one point retired nine batters in row, to earn the win. He also limited Japan to just five hits in the first six innings; however, the Japanese rallied in the seventh inning against Wang to tie the game with three runs. Japan won the game, preventing Taiwan from advancing to the next round.  

He is the third major leaguer from Taiwan, following Dodgers outfielder Chin-Feng Chen and Rockies pitcher Chin-Hui Tsao, and is by far the most successful.  Since being called up to the majors, Wang has been idolized in his native country where all of his games are televised nationwide, many on big screens to large audiences.  This is still true even though he decided not to pitch in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

The Yankees.
In 2005, Wang was called up from the Yankees' AAA affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. 
In the first season as a major league player, he earned 8 wins and 5 losses with 4.02 ERA. In addition, he pitched for the first time in a post-season game against the Los Angeles Angels.

On September 19, 2005, Wang tied a record for assists in a game by a pitcher with nine. 

On June 3, 2006, Wang recorded his first major league save in a win over the Baltimore Orioles. He recorded his first complete game on June 18, 2006 against the Washington Nationals, but it was a bittersweet accomplishment as he allowed a 1-out, 2-run, walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman to lose the game 3-2.  



His first complete game win was on July 28, 2006, a 2-hit, 6-0 shutout of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium. In his next start, he threw eight shutout innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, in which he got an outstanding 18 ground ball outs. Were it not for the extreme heat in New York that day, he probably would've had an excellent chance of achieving shutouts in two consecutive starts, an extremely rare feat in this age of heavy emphasis on relief pitching, as he had a 7-0 lead.

Wang posted a 19-6 record with a 3.63 ERA along with 76 strikeouts, 407 ground outs, and 2.84 ground outs/fly outs ratio in 2006 season. He limited batters to a .211 batting average while games were tied, and a .205 batting average in games that were late and close, and limited Tampa Bay to a .159 batting average while beating them 3 times in 4 starts.  His 19 wins in 2006 broke the record for wins in a season by an Asian pitcher formerly held by Chan Ho Park. Along with Minnesota Twins ace Johan Santana, Wang led both leagues in wins.

He also was the Yankees Game One starter going into the postseason as the unlikely ace. The first game of the 2006 postseason against the Detroit Tigers ended up with the score of 8-4. Wang earned his first career postseason win on October 3, 2006, with 6.2 innings of pitching allowing only 3 earned runs. Wang is the first ethnic Asian starting pitcher to have won a post season game. During the 2006 season, he surpassed his total innings pitched in any other season, including those in Major League Baseball and in Taiwan. 

At the end of the season, Wang finished second to Santana in voting for the Cy Young award.  Wang collected 15 second-place votes, and 51 points.  He also received a ninth-place vote, good for two points, in the AL MVP balloting won by Justin Morneau.  In the MLB's This Year in Baseball Awards, he was voted the top starter in 2006 season with more than 47% of voters. 

Pitching.

Chien-Ming Wang is a sinkerball pitcher. His sinker and four-seam fastball combination typically sits between 92mph and 95mph, and can hit speeds up to 97 mph. In the major leagues, Wang throws his sinker to both right and left handers, but Wang features an improving mid-eighties slider, which he throws primarily to right handers. Wang also possesses a low eighties split-fingered fastball/forkball that he will occasionally throw to lefties. Wang's splitter is a distant third pitch, and it is considered to be a work-in-progress. Wang's pitching style is characterized by efficiency, command of the strike zone, few walks, few home runs allowed and very few strikeouts. Wang works quickly and uses his ground-ball inducing sinker to produce many double plays. This efficiency often allows Wang to maintain a low pitch count deep into games. Since his promotion to the major leagues, Wang is considered to have vastly improved his effectiveness out of the stretch and his ability to avoid getting distracted by runners on base, a problem that had affected him earlier in the year.

In Taiwan and the minor leagues, Wang threw a more conventional assortment of pitches, including a four-seam fastball, a changeup, and far more splitters. The sinker, which has become Wang's signature pitch, was developed during his minor league career with advice from former Yankee pitcher and pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre.

Trivia.
 Height: 6'3"  Weight: 220;
 Wang enters to "Let's Get It Started" by the Black Eyed Peas.
 Wang's number 41 was retired on July 27, 2006 by the Staten Island Yankees where he played minor league A ball for two years and posted an ERA of 1.75, which was the second lowest in franchise history.  The first 2000 fans at the ceremony received a limited edition Chien-Ming Wang bobblehead doll that features rare "life-like" hair.;
 Wang was actually the biological child of his uncle and aunt, and his parents had adopted him. Because of the Taiwanese media frenzy over this issue, Wang declared in August 18th 2006 that he would not accept interviews with the Taiwanese media until further notice.  Later on, Wang's agent stated on his behalf in August 30th 2006 that the above declaration has been lifted.;

<doc id="3676460" title="Dahlia Seed" nonfiltered="1152" processed="1142" dbindex="451165">
Dahlia Seed (1992-1996) was an influential, and groundbreaking indie rock/post-hardcore band from the New York/New Jersey area, that was instrumental in defining the sound which is now termed as Emo.

The beginning.
Dahlia Seed began in the summer of 1992, in the northern New Jersey suburbs as a four piece band that played a tight, and aggressive version of the indie pop that was prevalent at the time. With all the musicians having a background in the New York hardcore scene, the sound of Dahlia Seed was a bit tougher than the other cookie-cutter indie stalwarts of the era, but the most important aspect that set Dahlia Seed above the competition was the vocal stylings of Tracy Wilson. Her "in your face" vocal style and delivery, coupled with a raw, and honest "open book" lyrical narrative, made her one of the most unique vocalists of the scene.
Dahlia Seed added a second guitarist (Jon Procopio) in 1993, and proceeded to release their first record, a 10" split w/Brokenmouth. It wasn't until their third single, the legendary Greyhouse/Dahlia Seed split 7", that the band started to gain some real notice and popularity. Their side of the split, a song called "Milk" struck a chord with almost everyone who heard it, and won them new fans, especially from the tight-knit, and cliqueish Riot Grrrl scene.

Rising Popularity.
1994 saw the release of "Valentine Kid's Litter", a full-length LP/CD culled from various demo recordings done in 1993. While the sound was a bit dated on the LP, it did give fans something more than split singles, and one-off compilation tracks to listen to. Jon Procopio left the band in summer 1994, and was replaced with Mike O'Keefe on guitar.
Dahlia Seed played extensively in 1994 and early 1995, with such varied acts as Archers of Loaf, Everclear, Built to Spill, Texas is the Reason, Avail, Los Crudos, Heavens to Betsy, etc, and in the summer of 1995, headed off to Philadelphia to record their first proper record "Survived By". Although "Survived By" is considered by many to be the quintessential Dahlia Seed record because it captures the band at its zenith of songwriting, and performance, the overall production of the record betrays the undeniable power of Dahlia Seed as a live act, and tends to leave the listener a bit underwhelmed.

The Breakup.
After production wrapped on "Survived By", Dahlia Seed headed out on their first ill-fated U.S./Canadian tour. Two weeks into the tour, guitarist Mike O'Keefe unexpectedly quit the band, which brought the tour to a halt somewhere in the mid-west of America. Dahlia Seed returned home to re-group, and added new guitarist Kevin McManus.
With the addition of Kevin Mc Manus, 1996 became a banner year for Dahlia Seed. "Survived By" was released in the spring to much praise, and critical acclaim, and shortly after that the band set out on a very successful U.S. tour.
Upon return from the tour, the members of Dahlia Seed decided that it was time to call it quits, and finished up their run in August 1996, with a sold out farewell show at Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey Some reports had fans as far away as Toronto, and Chicago making the trip for the show, only to be turned away at the door.
In 1999, Dahlia Seed's parting shot to the world was the release of "Please Excuse All The Blood". This CD was a posthumous release that compiled all the singles, comp tracks, and unreleased material that Dahlia Seed had left scattered about during their four years. "Please Excuse All The Blood" is especially tasty for the Dahlia Seed fan because it starts off with the last three recordings Dahlia Seed did, (with Alap Momin of Dalek fame), before their break-up. The songs "Standing 8 Count", "Greg Leto's Tears", and the stunning cover of VoiVod's "Missing Sequences" are considered by fans to be some of the best work the band ever did, and serves as a lament to what the future might have held for the band.

<doc id="3862179" title="Michael J. Kirwan" nonfiltered="1155" processed="1145" dbindex="451169">


Michael Joseph Kirwan (December 2, 1886 - July 27, 1970) was a U.S. Democrat from Ohio who served as a representative to the U.S. Congress from 1937 to 1970 elected in the 19th electoral district of Ohio. At the peak of his long congressional career, Kirwan was hailed as one of the most influential Democratic members of Congress, particularly on matters related to conservation.

Kirwan was born in Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, a manufacturing town in northeastern Pennsylvania. In 1907, he relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, a center of steel production located just west of the Pennsylvania border. During the First World War Kirwan served overseas as a sergeant in the Three Hundred and Forty-eighth Machine Gun Company with the Sixty-fourth Artillery, United States Army. Records indicate he served between 1917 and 1919. 

 Political career .

Upon his return to Youngstown, Kirwan established himself as an outspoken proponent of a plan to construct a Lake Erie to Ohio River canal--a proposal for which he would lobby tirelessly as Congressman from the 19th Congressional District of Ohio. Despite his later occupancy of important committee positions, however, Kirwan was unsuccessful in his efforts to achieve his most cherished goal as a lawmaker.

Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, Kirwan was successful in garnering substantial federal support for a variety of public works projects including dams, reservoirs, public swimming pools, and public park facilities. In 1940, he also helped to secure government funding for the nation's first major housing project, Westlakes Housing Village (later known as Westlakes Terrace), which was situated west of downtown Youngstown. The housing project comprised 618 units capable of sheltering 2,500 people. Erected under government financing, the project received 90 percent of its funding ($2,862,000) on a 60-year loan basis. Upon its completion, Kirwan lauded the housing project as a welcome alternative to what had been a dilapitated residential district, and further declared that it would serve as a model for the nation.

In later years, Westlakes Terrace, like other low-income housing projects, yielded mixed results. The provision of cheap housing proved to be inadequate compensation for the loss of thousands of urban jobs, the decline of public transportation, the advent of suburbanization, and a host of other trends that adversely affected urban dwellers. Westlakes Terrace was recently converted to other purposes.

Powerful testimony to Kirwan's growing influence in the U.S. Congress came in 1948, when he was unanimously elected chairman of the National Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the first time a Northern Democrat had been named to that important post. In 1954, Kirwan was widely credited among Democratic Congressional leaders as the architect of the party's success in the November congressional elections. Despite his advancing years, he announced on Dec. 3, 1957 (his 71st birthday) that he would seek a 12th term in Congress. The following year, Kirwan was among scores of Mahoning Valley Democratic candidates who secured sweeping victories; and in 1959, he was elected to his seventh term as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

 Final years .

Among the highlights of Kirwan's later career was an event held in his honor at Youngstown's Idora Park Ballroom. The keynote speaker at that event was U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy, who would run successfully as the Democratic presidential candidate the following year. In 1968, after being elected to his 17th term as a congressman, Kirwan announced that he would retire from public office at the close of his term. The following year, he was injured in a fall at the University Club at Washington, D.C., and was confined to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Kirwan experienced failing health for the next several months and died in Bethesda in 1970. His funeral was attended by more than 600 people, including a delegation of 50 members of Congress. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery, in Youngstown, Ohio.

 Legacy .

While aspects of Kirwan's legacy have proved durable, the constituency he served was adversely affected by deindustrialization, which swept through much of northeastern Ohio starting in the late 1970s.

<doc id="8828671" title="Beornhæth" nonfiltered="1156" processed="1146" dbindex="451170">
Beornhæth was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman in Northumbria in the reign of King Ecgfrith (ruled 671 685). He was the first of his family to come to notice.

Eddius's Life of Saint Wilfrid, recounting Ecgfrith's campaign against the Picts in 671 or 672, states that he was accompanied by the "sub-king" Beornhæth. It is presumed that Beornhæth ruled a part of northern Bernicia, perhaps in modern Lothian where there was a major Northumbrian fortress at Dunbar. In 8th century Northumbria, a large number of noble families claimed descent from the legendary King Ida, or from the Deiran royal house, but it is not known whether Beornhæth claimed descent from Ida. 

Beornhæth's son Berhtred (died c. 698), also called Berht, commanded King Ecgfrith's punitive expedition to the kingdom of Brega, in Ireland, in 684. Beorhtred's paternity is known from the notice of his death in the Irish annals, where he is called the son of Beornhæth. 

Historians presume that Berhtfrith, "a nobleman second in rank only to Osred", was a son of Berhtred. Berhtfrith was largely responsible for the defeat of the would-be King Eadwulf, and the installation of Aldfrith's son Osred on the throne as child-king in 705. Berhtfrith appears to have achieved this by making peace between Osred's supporters, and those of Bishop Wilfrid.

ARA Gómez Roca (P-46) is the sixth and last ship of the MEKO 140A16 series of six corvettes built for the Argentine Navy. The ship is the first ship to bear the name of Lieutenant Commander Sergio Gómez Roca, who commanded the Argentine patrol ship ARA Alférez Sobral during the Malvinas War and died in combat when the ship was attacked by British helicopters. Originally the ship was to have been named Seaver after Captain Benjamin Seaver, a US-born naval hero of the independence war.

She was constructed at the Río Santiago Shipyards of the Astilleros y Fábricas Navales del Estado (State Shipyards and Naval Factories) state corporation. 

 Origin .

Gómez Roca and her sister ships were part of the 1974 Naval Constructions National Plan, an initiative by the Argentine Navy to replace old World War II-vintage ships with more advanced warships. The original plan called for six MEKO 360H2 destroyers, four of them to be built in Argentina, but the plan was later modified to include four MEKO destroyers and six corvettes for anti-surface warfare and patrol operations.

 Construction .

Gómez Rocas keel was laid down on June 7th, 1983 and was launched on November 14th, 1984.

Budgetary concerns effectively suspended the construction of the ship for almost a decade, until it was decided to finish her and her sister ship Robinson. Following the resumption of construction, the ship was delivered to the Navy in 2004 and commissioned in 2005.

Both Robinson and Gómez Roca benefitted from their construction delay by incorporating more advanced electronics than their four sister ships. As with Parker and Robinson, Gómez Roca is fitted with a telescopic hangar.

 Service History .

Following her commissioning Gómez Roca participated in several naval exercises and conducted fishery patrol duties in the Argentine Exclusive Economic Zone.

She is homeported at Puerto Belgrano Naval Base and is part of the Navy's 2nd Corvette Division with her five sister ships.

<doc id="1055466" title="Primal Fear (film)" nonfiltered="1166" processed="1156" dbindex="451181">




Primal Fear is a 1996 motion picture which tells a story of a defense attorney (Richard Gere) who defends an altar boy (Edward Norton) charged with the murder of a Catholic archbishop. The movie is an adaptation of William Diehl's novel. Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his career-launching role.

The film also stars Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, and Frances McDormand. It was directed by Gregory Hoblit. 

Plot.
Tagline: Sooner or later a man who wears two faces forgets which one is real.;


Martin Vail (Gere) is Chicago's most famous defense attorney, known for getting acquittals for the most unpopular defendants   and so jumps at the chance to represent Aaron Stampler (Norton), a young altar boy accused of murdering the city's sainted archbishop. At first only in it for the publicity, Vail actually begins to care about his emotionally damaged client when he uncovers some of the archbishop's dirty secrets, involving sexual abuse and worse.

Vail finds himself facing a much more difficult case. While confronting his client and saying that he is lying to him, Aaron breaks down, puts his head against the wall, and his counterpart "Roy" takes his place. Roy, unlike the meek Aaron, is a psychotic and violent man. He confesses to the murder of the archbishop and throws Vail against the wall, injuring his head. After the incident is over, Aaron has no recollection of it. The doctor examining Aaron believes Vail has a case: textbook "multiple personality disorder". However, as they are already in the middle of the trial, they cannot change the plea. 

Nonetheless, Vail and his defense team try their best to bring it to light. In one of the crucial trial scenes near the end of the film, Aaron is put on the stand and questioned by the prosecutor. After being harshly questioned, Aaron turns into Roy and charges at the prosecutor, assaulting her and threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. Aaron is held down by the police and is rushed back to his cell in handcuffs. In light of Aaron's apparent insanity, which is now clear to the court, the judge sentences him to a mental hospital where he will remain under close evaluation, but eventually could be released.

In the final scene of the film, Vail confronts Aaron to tell him the great news. Aaron again has no idea what happened in the courtroom, as he "lost time." After hearing the news that it will be possible that he will be freed, Aaron hugs him with extreme gratitude. However, just as Vail is leaving, Aaron says to him, "Can you please tell Mrs. Venable I'm sorry about her neck?" It is now apparant that Aaron has been pretending to be insane all along. However, the chilling twist comes when Vail asks "So there  never was a Roy..." Aaron takes one look at him and says "There never was an Aaron, counselor," which reveals that Aaron was his pretend personality, and that he was really Roy all his life. Stunned and in disbelief, the movie ends with Vail walking out of the courtroom, with Roy calling his name from the cell.

A museme is a minimal unit of musical meaning, analogous to a morpheme in linguistics, "the basic unit of musical expression which in the framework of one given musical system is not further divisible without destruction of meaning." A museme may:
be broken down into component parts which are not in themselves meaningful within the framework of the musical language...but are nevertheless basic elements (not units) of musical expression which, when altered, may be compared to the phonemes of speech in that they alter the museme (morpheme) of which they are part and may thereby also alter its meaning. (Tagg 1979, p.71);

The term was coined by Philip Tagg and derived from the work of Charles Seeger (Middleton 1990, p.189).

Musematic repetition ("repetition of musemes" (ibid, p.269)) is simple repetition "at the level of the short figure, often used to generate an entire structural framework." (ibid, p.189) and contrasted with discursive repetition, in which the repetition is not so precise.

Mucic acid, C6H10O8 or HOOC-(CHOH)4-COOH, is obtained by the oxidation of milk sugar, dulcite, galactose, quercite and most varieties of gum by nitric acid.

It forms a crystalline powder which melts at 213 °C. It is insoluble in alcohol, and nearly insoluble in cold water. When heated with pyridine to 140 °C, it is converted into allommic acid. When digested with fuming hydrochloric acid for some time it is converted into a furfural dicarboxylic acid  while on heating with barium sulfide it is transformed into athiophene carboxylic acid. The ammonium salt yields on dry distillation carbon dioxide, ammonia, pyrrol and other substances. The acid when fused with caustic alkalis yields oxalic acid.

With potassium bisulfate mucic acid forms 3-hydroxy-2-pyrone by dehydration and decarboxylation.

There are various Talmudic interpretations of the word aishel, but all agree that Abraham's intention was to provide hospitality. Rav understands it to mean an orchard to provide food for wayfarers.  Shmuel interprets it as an inn, since the Hebrew letters aishel (aleph, shin, lamed) is an acronym for Achila ("feeding"), Shtiya ("drinking"), and Linah ("lodging").

<doc id="3371142" title="The Bradys" nonfiltered="1175" processed="1165" dbindex="451190">
The Bradys was an American 1990 television drama that aired on CBS Television. It was a revival of the early 1970s sitcom, The Brady Bunch (1969 1974), and was about the trials and tribulations of the Brady family some 15 years after the end of the earlier series. It followed two earlier short-lived spin-off/continuation series: the 1977 effort The Brady Bunch Hour and 1981's The Brady Brides.

Influence and casting.
The Bradys series came about as the result of the ratings and critical success of the 1988 television movie A Very Brady Christmas. All of the original cast members of the 1969-1974 series returned except for Maureen McCormick (Marcia Brady) who declined to reprise the role and was replaced by Leah Ayres. The show also incorporated cast members from The Brady Brides who reprised their roles from the earlier series.

Style.
Produced at the height of the dramedy trend in American television, The Bradys aimed to change direction towards more dramatic storytelling than viewers had been used to in the previous Brady series. The dramedy format of the time was epitomised by the series Thirtysomething, and this led to the series being nicknamed Bradysomething.

Failure.
Poor reviews and low ratings led to the cancellation of the series after six episodes.  The Bradys may have failed because viewers weren't comfortable seeing a lighthearted 1970s sitcom transformed into a somewhat depressing melodrama. Alternatively, The Bradys may have failed because it was placed in a poor time slot on Friday nights. The Bradys screened at 8:00 p.m., the same time as ABC's Full House, a similar program to The Brady Bunch. In his book Growing Up Brady, Barry Williams stated that when the initial two hour episode aired, ratings were poor for the first hour, but when the second hour aired, the show won its timeslot. Attempts to convince CBS to move the show to the 9:00 p.m. time slot were to no avail.

Episodes.

Note: In syndication on channels such as ABC Family (formerly FOX Family), episodes are bundled in to two hour blocks, and retitled. ;
 Episodes 1 and 2 are sometimes known as The Brady 500;
 Episodes 3 and 4 are sometimes known as Bradys on the Move;
 Episodes 5 and 6 are sometimes known as Big Kids, Big Problems;

Jerry Houser as Wally Logan ;
Ron Kuhlman as Philip Covington III ;
Caryn Richman as Nora Brady ;
Martha Quinn as Tracy Brady ;
Ken Michelman as Gary Greenberg ;
Jaclyn Bernstein as Jessica Logan;

Format.

Unlike the original thirty-minute sitcom, The Bradys was an hour long and featured far more serious plotlines.  Among them:


 Bobby's budding car-racing career ends abruptly in the first episode after an accident leaves him a paraplegic.
 Peter breaks up with his fiancée, to whom he became engaged in A Very Brady Christmas.;
 Jan and Phillip, unable to conceive children of their own, adopt a Korean girl.
 Stay-at-home mother Marcia battles alcoholism while Wally loses yet another in a series of jobs, the latest being Mike's campaign manager. Wally and Marcia, who along with their two children have been forced to move in with Mike and Carol, eventually decide to open their own catering business to support their family.
 Radio host Cindy begins a romantic interest with her boss, a widower more than 10 years her senior who has two children.

Despite the more downbeat tone, the show did feature a laugh track at certain moments.

A macro virus is a fictional construct to describe a virus that is larger than usual, e.g. beyond the need of a microscope for the human eye to see it. As with real life viruses, they need other creatures to survive through a parasitic or carnivorous relationship.

Examples include:
The Ripley, a parasitoid macro-virus from the film Dreamcatcher and the novel by the same name by Stephen King;
The un-named macro parasitoid virus featured in an episode of Star Trek: Voyager titled Macrocosm, which had a lifecycle of starting as a virus creating bubonic plague-like boils on the skin, to a series of fly-like creatures which escaped from the boils, to a large-to-medium sized flying clawed creature with large circular serrated mouth and infecting proboscis. Victims died from the effects of the virus but the fly forms of the virus/parasite remain dormant in dead bodies until another creature comes nearby.
The Khaara from the Half-Life mod Natural Selection. Though predominantly an airborne virus, is able to manifest itself into various forms and structures.

<doc id="3054677" title="Hangover Square" nonfiltered="1182" processed="1171" dbindex="451197">
Hangover Square is a 1941 novel by English playwright and novelist Patrick Hamilton (1904 1962). It is set in Earls Court, London in 1939.

The main character is George Harvey Bone, a lonely borderline alcoholic who suffers from a split personality. He is obsessed with gaining the affections of Netta, a failed actress and one of George's circle of "friends" with whom he drinks. George suffers from 'dead moods' in which he is convinced he must kill Netta. Upon recovering from these interludes, he cannot remember them. The novel captures the mood of prewar London, and  is considered by a number of literary experts  Hamilton's most perfected work exemplifying the author's concerns over social inequalities, the rise of Fascism and the hovering doom of World War II.  

20th Century Fox bought the movie rights to the book. The screenplay was written by Barré Lyndon and made a number of changes, including the transformation of George Harvey Bone into a classical composer-pianist and  filming the story as a turn-of-the-century period piece. The locale appears to be late Victorian London, with the date 1899 shown in the opening scene. However, a theatre programme seen in the middle of the film is imprinted with the year 1903. That uncertainty aside, the period setting works well to create a dark mood, especially in the key scene when Bone (portrayed by Laird Cregar), having strangled Netta (Linda Darnell) on Guy Fawkes Night, carries her wrapped body through streets filled with revelers and deposits it on top of the biggest bonfire. The movie was released in New York on February 7, 1945, two months after its star, Laird Cregar, suffered a fatal heart attack. The final scene shows Cregar as Bone, mesmerizingly playing his great piano concerto (composed by Bernard Herrmann), unmindful of the conflagration around him, as flames consume all.

<doc id="8465497" title="Walker Linerlock" nonfiltered="1183" processed="1172" dbindex="451198">
The Walker Linerlock is a locking system developed by custom knifemaker Michael Walker in 1980 for use on folding knives.

When the blade of the knife is in the opened position it is held in place by a leaf spring (also called a lockbar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing.  To release the lock the user must press the lockbar back toward the handle side from whence it came to allow the blade to close.  In the closed position the lockbar rests alongside the handle and the blade. 

While linerlock style knives have been around since the late 19th century in what was known as an electrician's knife; Walker refined and popularized the design, eventually securing a trademark (SN 73813333) for the name linerlock.  Walker's main contribution to improve the design was to enable the leafspring to securely lock the blade open and facilitate true one handed opening of the knife.  This was accomplished by removing the weak backspring and adding a heat treated stop pin to align the blade in the open position.  Walker also added a detent ball to hold the blade in the closed position using the same spring force from the liner. 

Linerlock mechanisms are most commonly composed of steel or titanium.

The song "Chapaco Soy" is generally regarded by Tarijeños (or Chapacos) as the most popular folkloric song that represents their local heritage and the city of Tarija, Bolivia. 

Song Lyrics Synopsis.

Through the use of lyric symbolism and metaphors, the song "Chapaco Soy" depticts a protagonist (the Chapaco) who expresses a passionate devotion for his colorful Tarijeño heritage and hometown, his bohemian and simple way of life, and a local "chapaquita" (a young maiden from Tarija).  

"Chapaco Soy" was composed by Los Luceros del Alba. The most popular rendition, which was lyrically gender modified, was recorded by the regionally-famed, folkloric vocal artist, Enriqueta Ulloa.

<doc id="5790346" title="Monstrous adolescent" nonfiltered="1194" processed="1183" dbindex="451209">



Origin of the term.

The term "monstrous adolescent" is often used in discussing Japanese anime and the subjects involved.  Anime in its contemporary form is known to explore society's fears of ever-growing technology, the rebellious actions of children, and the apocalyptic scenarios that are suggested by combining these two themes.  A "monstrous adolescent" is often a quick-tempered or psychologically disturbed child with remarkable and world-changing powers, which were usually a result of scientific experiments, revolutionary technology, or human-caused pollution.  These children have the power to improve or alter the world , but because of their personality the child is often on the verge of destroying it completely.  The source of this create/destroy idea is usually traced back to the effects of Hiroshima and the capabilities of nuclear power and atomic bombs. The term itself can be credited to Susan J. Napier, who discusses the character type at length in an essay in her book Anime: From Akira to Princess Mononoke.
The theme of the "monstrous adolescent" is one that is often discussed in the Japanese art world; many consider it to be one of the many subtle repercussions of the bombing of Japan, similar to Godzilla and the Superflat art movement led by Takashi Murakami.

Examples.


Arguably the most well known examples of this character type appear in Katsuhiro Otomo's epic graphic novel and film Akira.  The story describes a bizarre group of superpowered (yet docile) children bred by the government in a future Tokyo, which falls into chaos when a psychotic teenager with remarkable abilities, Tetsuo Shima runs rampant throughout the city in search of another powerful child named Akira, whose power supposedly triggered World War III.

Tetsuo proved to be a prototype for many later anime villains or antiheroes who would have similar devastating powers.  Several notable examples are:

 The teenage pilots in Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami, and Asuka Langley Soryu - all three possess the ability to control giant mecha of enormous power; likewise their mental states are questionable.
Hotaru Tomoe, in the manga and anime Sailor Moon.  As Sailor Saturn, she possesses the power to destroy the world.

Roko Malani (17??-1833) was the eldest son of Rasolo, the first Tui Nayau (Paramount Chief of Fiji's Lau Islands), and of Laufitu a high ranking lady of Totoya and Tongan descent. He succeeded to the title Roko Sau, after engineering a successful coup d'état and slaying his uncle, Matawalu, the fourth Roko Sau, in battle. This kin slaying was the result of the latter s dislike and plan to expel Tongan settlers from Lakeba. As Malani was half Tongan, his hand was forced to remove his uncle from power and eliminate his followers as an effective force on the island.  Roko Malani was later installed as Tui Nayau, and thus become the second holder of this title.

He is described by one of the early missionaries to Lakeba as being "a good looking muscular man," and he was responsible for establishing the kingdom of the Tui Nayau in the form which it was known to the first European observers. One of his earliest campaigns resulting in the extension of his domain was to lead a battle against Cicia, then an independent island, in retribution for the earlier death of his cousin Nayacatabu. He ambushed the Tui Cicia, or overlord of Cicia, and his forces on Nayau and killed him. The ensuing bloodbath is still remembered by the place name where the battle occurred. This area on Nayau is called Sosoiwaidamudamu or the Swamp of Red Water. This battle is especially important as it brought Cicia from this point forward under the power of the Tui Nayau. In addition the islands of Komo and Olorua were given to the Kabara champion and his battle ally, Ravu, in recognition for Kabara s contribution to the defeat of Cicia. These two islands still remain as part of the Kabara District today.

Roko Malani is considered the progenitor of the noble household, Matailakeba. Two of his descendants included Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Fiji s first Prime Minister (a direct male line descendant), and Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, Fiji s first modern statesman. Roko Malani s principal wife was Ciri of Taqalevu, with whom he had a son, Vuetasau. It is likely he had other wives and offspring but there is scant record to demonstrate this. Towards the end of his reign, the first Christian  missionaries arrived in Fiji in 1830. These were three Tahitian missionaries of the London Missionary Society, sent to Lakeba to establish a church. Although it is recorded that he tolerated the early missionaries, and one of his sons Vaubula was an early convert and would later emerge as one of the first preachers amongst Fijians, he nevertheless remained faithful to the old religion. He died, as recorded by missionaries, a heathen in 1833.

Roko Malani was succeeded by his younger brother, Taliai Tupou.

Marineamt (English: Naval Office) is the German name of a higher command within the German Navy. It is the successor to the former Reichsmarineamt, the Department of the Navy of the Kaiserliche Marine prior to World War I.

The Marineamt was founded in 1956. Its original responsibility was training, education and armaments planning for the German Navy. It was situated at Wilhelmshaven until it was relocated to Rostock after German reunification 1990. In 2001 it was merged with the former Navy Support Command. Since then its responsibilities also include naval logistics.

The Marineamt is commanded by a Rear Admiral directly subordinate to the Chief of the Naval Staff in the Ministry of Defence. It is the superior command for all naval schools and bases as well as of some research and development institutions.

Pantip Plaza is an indoor IT shopping mall located on New Phetchaburi Road in Ratchathewi district, Bangkok, Thailand. The sale of counterfeit software and DVDs are the major reasons behind this mall's success and notoriety.

Software.
Legitimate licensed software remains unpopular for the majority of Pantip shoppers due to high prices and the availability of counterfeit versions of the same software.  Prices of counterfeit software, DVDs and games range from about 100 to 300 baht (USD 2.50-8).

A few publishers, such as Blizzard Entertainment, offer licensed "for sale in Thailand only" software with localized Thai packaging and manuals at prices in the $8-$20 range.

As of December 2005, purchasing pirated software remains an easy and open practice, despite the occasional shuttering of all shops selling illegal software and entertainment CDs, DVDs, and VCDs during police checks.

Hardware.
Pantip contains three large retail shops and several hundred small shops specializing in parts, modifications, hardware, networking, second hand, laptops, Macintosh and peripherals. Of note is a wide selection of second-hand business machines from IBM, Gateway, and Dell. Most of these machines come via cargo ship from Western countries. A large majority are, however, stolen goods from a number of sources. Recently hardware manufacturers such as Asus have reported the stolen hardware and are able to 'lock them down' when a specific peripheral is connected to the Asus website.

Pantip Plaza 2.
Pantip Plaza 2 is a branch of Pantip Plaza. Location is Ngamwongwan Road in Nonthaburi.

Chiang Mai location.
There is another Pantip Plaza in Chiang Mai, on the corner of Changkran Road and Sri Donchai Road.

In popular culture.
 Pantip Plaza is featured in a hit song by Loso, "Pantip", which has a hook chorus, "mai pai Pantip" ("no go Pantip" or "I won't go to Pantip") and is about a man dating a woman and taking her shopping at World Trade Center, MBK Center and Siam Square, but he refuses to take her to Pantip Plaza.

<doc id="210661" title="Media manipulation" nonfiltered="1205" processed="1194" dbindex="451220">
Media manipulation is an aspect of public relations in which partisans create an image or argument that favours their particular interests. Such tactics may include the use of logical fallacies and propaganda techniques, and often involve the  suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out, by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments, or by simply diverting attention elsewhere. 

As illustrated below, many of the more modern Mass media manipulation methods are types of distraction, on the assumption that the public has a limited Attention span.

Distraction types.
Distraction by nationalism.
See main article at Transfer (propaganda);
This is a variant on the traditional ad hominem and bandwagon fallacies applied to entire countries. The method is to discredit opposing arguments by appealing to nationalistic pride or memory of past accomplishments, or appealing to fear or dislike of a specific country, or of foreigners in general. It can be very powerful as it discredits foreign journalists (the ones that are least easily manipulated by domestic political or corporate interests).
 
Example: "You want to know what I really think of the Europeans?" asked the senior United States State Department official. "I think they have been wrong on just about every major international issue for the past 20 years." .
Example: "Your idea sounds similar to what they are proposing in Turkey. Are you saying the Turks have a better country than us?";
Example: "The only criticisms of this proposed treaty come from the United States. But we all know that Americans are arrogant and uneducated, so their complaints are irrelevant.";

Straw man fallacy.
See main article at Straw man;
The "straw man fallacy" is the lumping a strong opposition argument together with one or many weak ones to create a simplistic weak argument that can easily be refuted. 
Example: Grouping all opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq as "pacifists", so they can be refuted by arguments for war in general. As with most persuasion methods, it can easily be applied in reverse, in this case, to group all those who supported the invasion together and label them as "warmongers" or "lackeys of the United States".

Distraction by scapegoat.
See main article at Scapegoat;
A combination of straw man and ad hominem, in which your weakest opponent (or easiest to discredit) is considered as your only important opponent. 
Example: If many countries are opposed to our actions, but one of them (say, France) is obviously acting out of self-interest, mention mostly France. As with most persuasion methods, it can easily be applied in reverse, in this case, attempting to discredit George W. Bush in order to discredit the entire coalition against Iraq.

Distraction by phenomenon. 
A risky but effective strategy summarized best, perhaps, by David Mamet's 1997 movie Wag the Dog, by which the public can be distracted, for long periods of time, from an important issue, by one which occupies more news time. When the strategy works, you have a war or other media event taking attention away from misbehaving or crooked leaders. When the strategy does not work, the leader's misbehavior remains in the press, and the war is derided as an attempted distraction. 
US President Clinton's involvement in Bosnia is often cited as an example, to distract attention from the Monica Lewinsky affair, as well as US President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq.;

Other types.
Marginalization.
See main article at Appeal to authority;
This is a widespread and subtle form of media manipulation: simply giving credence only to "mainstream" sources of information, which are also the easiest to manipulate by corporate or political interests, since they can be owned or sponsored by them. Information, arguments, and objections that come from other sources are simply considered "fringe" and ignored, or their proponents permanently discredited, or accused of having their own agenda.
Example: "I think there are a lot of people out there who feel the way I do, but haven't wanted to come forward because they're afraid of being identified with a fringe group..." Langley said. "I don't believe in all the things that all the (anti-war) groups stand for, but we all do share one thing in common: I do believe that this war is wrong." ;

Demonisation of the opposition. 
See Obtain disapproval within the article Propaganda ;
This is a more general case of distraction by nationalism. Opposing views are ascribed to an out-group or hated group, and thus dismissed out of hand. This approach, carried to extremes, becomes a form of suppression, as in McCarthyism, where anyone disapproving of the government was considered "un-American" and "Communist" and was likely to be denounced.
Example: The consignment of almost all dissent to the "International Jewish conspiracy" by Nazi Germany.    ;
Example: Labelling all those opposed to Neocon policies as left-wing, making use of existing prejudices against Communists.
Example: Labelling of Conservative Party of Canada MPs as "Republicans" or "Neocons" by left-wing Liberal or NDP members.

Googlewashing.
See main article at Googlewashing;
This is a new word coined by Andrew Orlowski of The Register in April of 2003  to describe the alleged practice of changing the meaning of a meme (in this example, Second Superpower) by web-publishing a well-linked article using the term in an inoffensive manner, stripped of its political significance. Google has also been observed to exclude certain sites from the search function (notably Google.fr and or Google.de).

People concerned about media manipulation have promoted the teaching of media literacy to teach about the above techniques and thus make them less effective with people thus educated.

Bobby Isaac (born August 1, 1932 or 1934, the exact year is disputed - died August 14, 1977) is a former NASCAR Grand National (now Nextel Cup) Series champion.  

Isaac grew up on a farm near Catawba, North Carolina, the second-youngest of nine children. He finished school after the sixth grade, which lead to the incorrect rumor that he could neither read nor write .   

NASCAR career.
He began racing full-time in 1956, but it took him seven years to break into the Grand National division. Isaac won the championship in 1970 driving the #71 Dodge Charger Daytona sponsored by K&K Insurance. His crew chief was legendary Harry Hyde. Isaac & Hyde took the car to Talladega in November and set a closed-course speed record.

Isaac won 37 races in NASCAR's top series during his career, including 11 in his championship season, and started from the pole position 50 times.  He took 20 poles in a single season in 1969. This NASCAR record that will be hard to beat since there are currently 36 races on the schedule. According to Isaac a strange "voice" in the car told him to retire from driving because it threatened he would be killed.

Land Speed Records.
Isaac also made his mark outside of NASCAR.  In September 1971, he went to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and set 28 world speed records, some of which still stand to this day.

Awards.
Bobby Isaac was inducted into the National Motorsports Press Association Hall of Fame in 1979, and the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1996.  In 1998 NASCAR honored Isaac as one of its NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers of all time.

Death.
Unfortunately, Bobby did not live to enjoy any of the accolades.  He pulled out of a 1977 Late Model Sportsman race at Hickory Motor Speedway with 25 laps left, and died of a heart attack.

<doc id="2409909" title="Room of Spirit and Time" nonfiltered="1208" processed="1197" dbindex="451223">
The Room of Spirit and Time (        Seishin to Toki no Heya) (The Hyperbolic Time Chamber in FUNimation's  English dub), from the manga Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z and the anime Dragon Ball/Z, is a fictional place located on Kami's Lookout. Inside the Chamber time seems to pass very slowly, and there is a higher gravity level than Earth's, starting at 1 g and increasing proportionally the further out one goes.

Description.
The Room of Spirit and Time has an entrance at its center, located in a central building with two side wings with housing, food supplies, bathing quarters and sleeping quarters. There is no night or day in the Room, but the surroundings remain a constant bright iridescent white aurora. Its reflective floor is of undefined area, and the Room's boundaries are thought to stretch to infinity in all directions even though it appears to have a definite atmosphere, limiting its size. The Room of Spirit and Time represents a separate dimension from that of Earth.

The time dilation that occurs in the Room of Spirit and Time is one day of real time is equivalent to one year in the Room, or 1 second of real time is approximately six minutes in the chamber. There are dual giant hourglasses of emerald sand adorning the sides of the building that count down a year within the chamber. A clock on the dome roof of the main part of the building tells the applicable time in the real world.

This essentially allows for someone entering the Room of Spirit and Time to get one year worth of intense training in a single day.

The gravity in the Room of Spirit and Time starts at 1 g at its center and increases proportionally to the distance away from the center (i.e. as one moves further away from the Chamber's center, the gravity one feels increases). Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, and Trunks are the only characters shown to go deep into the chamber. It isn't shown if Piccolo, Goten, or Trunks did, though it can be assumed at least Piccolo did.

The wooden door entrance is a portal between the Earth and the Room of Spirit and Time, and is the only way to travel between the two dimensions without "ripping holes in the dimensional walls".

The Room can only be entered twice by a person, as by the third time the door locks, leaving them in nothingness and not allowing anyone else to use the door. Also, their are only enough provisions to accommodate two people for the full year. This is commonly misinterpreted as a two-person limit overall, but it should be noted that in the Buu Saga four people in total entered through the main door.

Dragon Ball Z.


Imperfect Cell Saga.

Vegeta and his son Trunks enter the Room to train for their attempt to prevent Cell from attaining his complete form. Both train as ascended Super Saiyans, and Trunks surpasses his father in brute strength, but has issues with not getting in the way of his father's pride, so Trunks hides his power level. Trunks unknowingly makes a mistake by using his time in the Room of Spirit and Time to increase his strength, while sacrificing his speed and dexterity. Both Vegeta and Trunks fail to prevent Cell's completion, although Vegeta deliberately took part in allowing Cell to become complete for the sport of fighting him at a more challenging state.

Perfect Cell Saga.

Goku and his son Gohan enter the Room in preparation to fight against Cell. While training with his father, Gohan becomes a Super Saiyan, becoming the youngest Super Saiyan of his time. They both emerge from the Room with a heightened control over their Super Saiyan transformation. They developed an optimization technique to stay in the Super Saiyan state for long periods of time in order to eliminate the strain from transforming. This allowed them to save energy for fighting, and worked so well they could even sleep while in Super Saiyan form. This training greatly assisted in Gohan's upgrade to Super Saiyan 2 during the Cell Games.

Piccolo entered the Room for meditation and self training, followed by Vegeta and Trunks entering again, increasing their power levels even further (although not quite surpassing Goku and Gohan). Piccolo reached a level of power equal to or possibly greater than Cell in his semi-perfect form (given he could hold his own against a Cell Jr, a much more powerful foe than "semi-perfect" Cell). Trunks and Vegeta's power levels didn't increase near as much as the first time they entered (possibly due to the fact that unlike last time, they acquired no new forms during this period, instead focusing on powering up their regular Super Saiyan state to its maximum), but they still improved enough to put up an evenly matched battle against the Cell Jrs. The Room of Spirit and Time was not used again until after the Cell Games.

Fusion Saga.

Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo enter the Room of Spirit and Time to lure in the horrible Super Buu. When Buu enters the Room, Trunks and Goten use the Fusion Dance technique to become Gotenks. They introduce their Ghost Attack and upgrade themselves to Super Saiyan while fused. During the battle Gotenks falsely says he can't win in hopes of creating a more dramatic victory. Believing the act, Piccolo destroys the Room of Spirit and Time's entrance, leaving "no way out". Buu can't stand the thought of being stuck in the Room (mostly because of his fondness towards chocolate, and the lack of it in this dimension). So Buu in an intense rage, screams at the top of his lungs. The scream is so loud, that it rips a hole leading back to Earth's dimension. Buu gets out but it's too late for Gotenks and Piccolo, as the portal closes behind him. Gotenks and Piccolo attempt to recreate Buu's mad howl, and succeed only after Gotenks transforms into Super Saiyan 3, and yells their way out.

The Room of Spirit and Time is rendered non-functional without a door, and must be repaired for future use.

NOTE: Some could argue that when Buu destroyed the Lookout, (in later episodes) the Room of Spirit and Time could have been fully repaired because the Lookout was wished back damage free.

NOTE 2: Akamatsu Ken pays tribute to this training ground in Mahou Sensei Negima, albeit a less extreme version wherein one hour outside equals one day inside.

<doc id="4500197" title="Ted Chippington" nonfiltered="1212" processed="1201" dbindex="451227">
Ted Chippington (born 1960) is a British stand-up comedian and entertainer.  His act is one in which the conventions of his chosen craft are routinely flouted.  Assuming a diffident on-stage persona (in contrast to the self-confident aura of most comics) and delivering his material in a West Midlands monotone, he eschews observational comedy in favour of anti-humour and jokes which are mostly variations on the same theme (see examples below), interspersed with his own versions of well-known songs performed in a similarly listless style.  This approach has left many audiences bemused or even hostile (his legendary expertise at dealing with hecklers comes from frequent practice).

However, Ted's deadpan style has also won him a small but devoted following.  Probably his most notable fan is Stewart Lee, who has often cited Chippington as the reason he started doing stand-up comedy himself, and has described Ted's act as being "a mixture of surrealism and insolent provocation and uncompromising boredom".  Another admirer, Richard Herring, talks of Chippington's "contempt for the very idea of jokes".   For his part Ted - who describes his own act as being influenced by Lenny Bruce and Owd Grandad Piggott  - says he is an "anti-comedian" and that he only started doing his act "to annoy people".  He has even claimed that his main reason for retiring from the stage in the 1990s was that he was becoming too popular.

 Early years .

Born Francis Smyth in Birmingham, Ted started performing in 1981 under the name "Eddie Chippington" before changing to Ted "due to maturity and baldness".  He first came to national prominence when a gig he had performed in Birmingham in 1984 supporting The Fall (his favourite band) was released by local record label Vindaloo on a 7" EP entitled "Non Stop Party Hits of the 50s 60s and 70s".  The EP title refers to his penchant for performing his own versions of classic hits, including on this occasion his rendering of Ottawan's 'D.I.S.C.O.'.  The record was played by John Peel on his BBC Radio One programme - a rare privilege for a comedian.  

In 1986 he released an album, 'Man In A Suitcase' - a collection of live recordings plus some more songs, included his celebrated versions of "She Loves You" and Alvin Stardust's 'I Feel Like Buddy Holly' - which reached the Top 10 indie album chart.  "She Loves You" received wider exposure after Steve Wright repeatedly played it on his Radio 1 show, which in turn led to the track being released as a single by Warner Brothers.  It narrowly failed to make the Top 40 but Ted claims that the deal with Warners earned him "£1,000 and a nice curry". .

Despite its failure to crack the charts, "She Loves You" raised Ted's profile considerably and led to numerous media appearances, including a turn on the BBC's lunchtime magazine show Pebble Mill at One (thus fulfilling a lifetime's ambition, despite having his act rubbished by presenter Paul Coia).  He also fielded interviews with the New Musical Express, Birmingham's BRMB (where he managed to thoroughly baffle his interviewer) and, bizarrely, the colour supplement of The Mail on Sunday.  He also performed at the Glastonbury and Reading festivals.

Ted once again came dangerously close to mainstream UK singles chart success with a recording of his theme tune 'Rocking with Rita' which he performed with his fellow Vindaloo artists Rob Lloyd and The Nightingales and We've Got A Fuzzbox And We're Gonna Use It.  A further single followed with his reading of Dion's "The Wanderer", in which the boastfulness of the original lyrics was turned on its head: "I'm not the wanderer, I'm not the wanderer...not too keen on roaming around and around and around".

In spite of all this, Chippington's ruthless disregard for the conventions of stand-up made him a perennial outcast from the 1980s comedy scene.  At a time when politically right-on performers such as Ben Elton and Harry Enfield were at their peak, Ted (who once claimed his favourite comedian was Bernard Manning ) struggled to break through to a wider audience.  However his fans - or "good mates" as Ted likes to call them - remain convinced of his status as a neglected comedy genius, and regard him with an affection that is rarely afforded to stand-up comics.

 Retirement .

In 1990, feeling overwhelmed by the media attention, Ted retired from showbusiness to pursue a career in truck-driving in the US.  This ended ignominiously when his lorry shed its load on the Pacific Coast Highway.  After this he tried his hand as a cook in various restaurants in Mexico, before returning to the UK, getting married and settling in Torquay.

 Return to performing .

In 2006 he started performing again.  He now styles himself "The Reverend Ted Chippington" and has ditched his old Teddy Boy stage outfit in favour of a vicar's dog-collar.  He has also changed much of his material, meaning that Ted connoisseurs of old who are expecting to hear the "railway station joke" are likely to be disappointed.

A CD boxset of Ted's earlier work, entitled "Walking Down The Road", has been released on Robert Lloyd's Big Print label.  A tribute to Chippington entitled "Tedstock" was held at London's Bloomsbury Theatre in February 2007 in order to raise money to fund this release.  The show included performances from Stewart Lee and Richard Herring, along with fellow Ted fans Simon Munnery, The Nightingales, Phill Jupitus, Josie Long and Stephen Carlin.  (Simon Amstell also appeared but claimed never to have heard of him.)  This event has led to a new flurry of media appearances for Chippington, including articles in The Guardian and The Independent and appearances on BBC Two's The Culture Show and the Phill Jupitus show on BBC 6 Music.

Examples of Chippington humour.

"I was walking down the road the other day, this chap drove up beside me and said, 'Excuse me, mate, I'm in a dilemma.'  I said, 'Aye, good motors, Dilemmas.  I was thinking of buying one myself.  A red one perhaps.'";

"I was walking down the road the other day, this chap walked up to me and said 'Do you want to buy some grass, mate?' I said 'No thanks, mate, I've got crazy paving.  Haven't got a garden, you see.'";

"I was walking down the road the other day, this chap walked up to me and said 'Do you want to buy some LSD, mate?' I said 'No thanks, mate, We've gone decimal now.  You know, pounds, shillings and pence - no use to me any more.'";

"I was walking down the road the other day, this chap came up to me.  He said 'I've just got back from Nam.' I said, 'What, you mean Vietnam?' He said 'No, mate, Chelt'nam.'";

"I look forward to when I've got a car and I can drive down the road, so I won't get all these characters coming up to me.";

Balearic Islands cuisine refers to the typical dishes and ingredients in the cuisine of the Balearic Islands, in Spain. Balearic traditional cuisine is deeply related to the concept of Mediterranean diet, this is, rich in vegetables, cereal and pulses, and poor in fats.

A succinct selection of the main recipes would be

 Bakery and confectionery .

Unsalted bread

Ensaimada (lard cake)

Flaó (cottage cheese tart)

Coca (similar to Italian pizza but without cheese). Typically Majorcan varieties include Parsley (juliverd), roasted peppers (prebes torrats), trampó (tomato, green pepper and onion salad)

Easter cakes like panades (meat cakes) or robiols (cottage cheese cakes)

 Vegetables .
Tumbet (fried courgette, potato, aubergine and bell pepper baked in tomato sauce). Tumbet is related to similar Mediterranean gastronomical concepts like samfaina or ratatouille.

Fava parada, fava bean and vegetable pure
 Meat .
Traditional sausages like sobrassada
Lamb and piglet roasts (mè rostit, porcella rostida)

Aubergines or courgettes stuffed with minced meat

Arròs brut (dirty rice): meat, game and vegetable spicy rice in a meat broth
 Fish .
Lobster casserole (caldereta)

Different baked fishes, like grouper (anfós)

Arròs de peix, rice cooked in a fish broth with fish bites

 Other .
Maó cheese (cow cheese vaguely resembling Grana Padano or Parmesan
Red wines from the Binissalem and Pla i Llevant areas
This delicious cuisine is more and more enthwined in mainstream gastronomy and is currently being mixed into more moderns recipes in fusion cuisine.

<doc id="523470" title="Tupeni Baba" nonfiltered="1215" processed="1204" dbindex="451230">


Tupeni Lebaivalu Baba is a Fijian academic and politician, who founded the now-defunct New Labour Unity Party. Most members of this party later merged with several other centrist parties to form the Fiji Democratic Party (now part of the National Alliance Party).  A former Professor of Education at the University of the South Pacific (USP), he later served as a senior research fellow at the Centre for Pacific Studies at Auckland University in New Zealand, from 2001 to the end of 2005.  In the general election scheduled for 6-13 May 2006, Baba attempted a political comeback, this time on the ticket of the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), a political switch that generated a considerable degree of public discussion.  Although his bid was unsuccessful, he was subsequently appointed to the Senate as one of nine nominees of the Fijian government. 

 Political career .

Baba was a founding member of the Fiji Labour Party in the mid-1980s and was elected in 1987 to the House of Representatives as a candidate of the Labour-National Federation Party Coalition, which brought Timoci Bavadra to power.  A month later, the new government was deposed in a coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka.  Baba returned to his academic career, taking a post as a lecturer at the University of Suva, where he remained until 1999, when he was again elected to Parliament and became Foreign Minister and one of two Deputy Prime Ministers in the government of Mahendra Chaudhry.  During the coup of 2000 in which most members of the government were kidnapped by George Speight, Baba's courage as one of the hostages earned him considerable public respect.

Baba launched the NLUP in June 2001 after resigning from the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) of former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, who had been deposed in the Fiji coup of 2000.  The breach followed months of intra-party infighting, much of which preceded the coup.  Large numbers of anti-Chaudhry dissidents followed him out of the party into the New Labour Unity Party.  Baba's departure was thought to be one of the reasons why the Labour Party lost the elections held to restore democracy in September 2001; its share of the vote among ethnic Fijians dropped to around two percent.  Baba's NLUP captured two seats, although Baba himself was not elected.  During the campaign, he called on the electorate not to support his former party, warning that a return to a government led by Chaudhry could result in another coup.  For this, he was accused of fear-mongering. 

 Life outside politics .

Baba waited until 2005 to reiterate and clarify his reasons for leaving the Labour Party.  It was no longer the party he had joined under the leadership of Timoci Bavadra in the 1980s, he said on 18 September 2005.  Bavadra's vision had been of a multiracial Fiji, but the present leadership of the party could not see past ethnic boundaries.  All that was left of Bavadra's party was the name, he said.  He expressed disappointment at Chaudhry's failure as Leader of the Opposition to work with Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase on matters of national importance, saying that when the party negotiated with the government at all, it appeared more like a trade union than a political party.  In a multiethnic country like Fiji, Baba said, it was imperative that leaders look beyond ethnic boundaries.

On 22 December 2005, Baba said that he would pursue academic and consultancy work after completing his four-year contract at the University of Auckland, which expired at the end of 2005.  He was happy to be away from politics, he said, and was not inclined to return to it.  He found recent political trends in Fiji depressing, especially the polarization of political parties on ethnic lines.  Questioned again by the Fiji Village news service on 16 February, after his return to Fiji, he refused to be drawn on whether he would contest the 2006 election or not, but made it clear that he was no longer affiliated with the FLP.

 Speight of Violence .

On 15 May 2005, the publication of "Speight of Violence," coauthored by Baba, his wife Unaisi Nabobo-Baba (a fellow USP academic now completing her Ph.D. at Auckland University), and journalist Michael Field, generated controversy with the claim that Mahendra Chaudhry had promised him the Prime Ministership before and during the 1999 election campaign, and that Chaudhry had reneged on that promise.  Chaudhry reacted strongly to the allegation, saying that no such promise was or would have been made.  An FLP press release called Baba was "a frustrated and embitterered" person who had left the Labour Party after a failed bid for the leadership.  "Speight of Violence" is based largely on a diary that Baba claims to have compiled secretly while held hostage by Speight's loyalists, but also gives background information, from Baba's perspective, on political events up to and following the coup.

 SDL convert, 2006 .

The Fiji Times reported on 11 March 2006 that the ruling SDL had approached Baba with an invitation to contest the parliamentary election scheduled for 6-13 May under the SDL banner.  On 18 March, the SDL announced that Baba had been approved as its candidate for the Tamavua Samabula Open Constituency.  Fiji Village quoted Baba as saying that his decision to join the SDL was motivated by what he called the lack of leadership in the FLP.  

FLP politicians, however, poured derision on the move.  Leader Mahendra Chaudhry said that Baba was a deserter, and that the SDL must be "hard up for candidates" to have selected a man like him, while Deputy Leader Poseci Bune told the Fiji Sun that he was baffled by the turn of events.  "He used to be a liberal left winger but now he is back to nationalist. SDL must be desperate for candidates," he surmised.  Fijian Political Party (SVT) General Secretary Ema Druavesi also expressed disappointment with Baba's decision, saying he had joined a party lacking "the character of a good leadership."

The Fiji Times quoted Baba on 20 March as saying that the SDL was "the only alternative for Fiji moving forward."  He praised its success in reviving the economy; he conceded that some of its legislation was controversial, but saw it as an attempt to move the country forward.  He still considered himself a liberal and a socialist, he said, but insisted that had to be seen in the multiracial context of Fiji.  His former party, the FLP, gave mere lip service to multiracialism, he charged.  "I have responded to the request of the SDL party according to the mood of politics because I am fed up of confrontational and negative politics," he said.

 Personal life .

Baba's had a son, Viliame, and  a daughter, Raijeli, with his first wife, Miriama Cagilaba, a native of Natewa in Cakaudrove Province.  In 2002, Raijeli married the then-Chief Justice, Sir Timoci Tuivaga.  With his second wife, Unaisi, Baba has one son.

Baba is related to Sitiveni Rabuka, who deposed the 1987 government in which he served.

Pricelessware is freeware selected annually as the best of the best by the readers of the newsgroup alt.comp.freeware since 1999.

Pricelessware was the brainchild of Son of Spy, one of alt.comp.freeware's regular contributors and champion of forgotten freeware. Initially designed as a FAQ of sorts for the most requested programs, the list highlighted the best 1 or 2 programs in various categories, but was never intended as an exhaustive list of the best available freeware. 

The first selection was made in December of 1999 and was initially called the "Big List". The idea was to have a stickie page that could be used by newbies as a first-stop resource or by members of the newsgroup when recommending programs.

The term pricelessware was coined by Tiger®, another regular of the alt.comp.freeware newsgroup at the time of creation, with the idea of setting apart the freeware selected for this list. 

Initially hosted on Son of Spy's own site, Pricelessware evolved from a simple list to a more complete listing which included program descriptions and home page links. It found a permanent home in the summer of 2001.

There are no adware or spyware programs included on the Pricelessware list.

Pricelessware programs are chosen by a vote conducted in November-December of every year in the newsgroup alt.comp.freeware. While the exact procedures vary from year to year, the first criteria is to recognise the best freeware programs, not attempt to find a program to fit every conceivable category. Programs must be nominated and seconded before they are included on the ballot. In the true spirit of Usenet, nominations and votes are open to any person who wishes to be a part of the process.

Programs are also added and/or removed throughout the year, in a formal mid-year review or when events warrant it, such as a change of freeware status or a new program introduction. 

The site's current address is http://www.pricelesswarehome.org.  As of Tuesday, April 25th 2006, the original site (www.pricelessware.org) had not been updated since September 2004.

<doc id="929421" title="Korell" nonfiltered="1218" processed="1207" dbindex="451233">
Korell is a planet in Foundation by Isaac Asimov.  

Located in the Whassalian Rift, it was the capital of the Republic of Korell, a republic only in name.  The dictator, called the Commdor ("first citizen of the state"), is elected every year.  Through some twist or another, a member of the Argo family is always chosen.  According to Hober Mallow, people who didn't like this arrangement had "things" happen to them.  According to Asimov, unlike a de jure monarch, the de facto monarchy associated with the status of the Commdor was not moderated by the typical influences of "honour" and "court etiquette".

Korell was the third Seldon Crisis, because it was the first nation encountered by the Foundation with an effective system of nucleics, and because by this point in time the Foundation's previous method of subverting enemies through a pseudo-religion based on Foundation science had largely played itself out.  When Hober Mallow was sent to investigate.  Mallow visited Asper Argo, Commdor of Korell, and opened up trade with his people through him.  Despite discovering the steel foundries were not nuclear, Mallow did spot nuclear blasters provided by the Galactic Empire.  Otherwise, Korell was decadent.  The only remains of the Empire were  silent memorials  and  broken buildings ; the navy consisted of  tiny, limping relics  and  battered, clumsy hulks .


Mallow later learned that the viceroy of the Normannic Sector was providing Korell with nuclear blasters and with ships (five by the time Korell declared war with the Foundation; a sixth was promised).  Mallow quickly realised that the real enemy was the Empire, not Korell; forcing himself into the office of mayor, Mallow was able to destroy the threat of Korell by doing nothing.  Since his visit three years before had made Korell dependent on Foundation-made goods, the Korellians raised a good deal of complaint over their minor inconveniences resulting from the cessation of this trade.  Since there was no threat of foreign conquest to unite them, the people became rebellious.  Faced by this situation, the Commdor was forced to surrender to the Foundation unconditionally.

The planets of the Korellian Republic eventually entered the Foundation's hands.  They were captured briefly by Kalgan during the early stages of the war with Kalgan.

This is the timeline for STS-121, the mission to the ISS.
About.
The shuttle was docked to the ISS for the majority of the flight. For much of the time the shuttle was at the ISS the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Leonardo was mated and accessible to the crew for the transfer of equipment, supplies, returned experiments and trash. 
Three spacewalks were carried out on the mission, the third was dependent on sufficient consumables being available and two alternate timelines were planned, with and without the final spacewalk. There were also additional "Get Ahead" tasks planned for the crew to do at the ISS if they found themselves with more time than planned, one such get ahead task was completed on EVA 2. The crew were able to take the majority of one day off, during which they explored the ISS, took photographs, and conducted press interviews.    
July 1 (Launch attempt 1).
Events throughout the day went according to plan, one exception being an abnormal temperature reading on thruster L5L (see Pre-launch concerns).  The launch window was from 3:48:41 to 3:53:02 p.m.  At 3:42, while in the T-9 built-in hold, mission control decided to postpone launch because anvil (thunderstorm) clouds and lightning were detected within 20 miles of the launch area and path.  Launch was rescheduled for July 2 at 3:26 p.m.
STS-121 was the first launch during which NASA took special precautions to deter vultures, particularly the local Turkey Vulture, from flying over the area.  Efforts included the swift removal of roadkill and other dead animals from areas around the launch site. This followed a near miss during STS-114.

July 2 (Launch attempt 2).
Again, the countdown continued according to schedule with a launch time of 3:26 p.m.  At 9:30 am on July 2, the NASA launch blog reported that the "shuttle weather officer forecasts a 70-percent chance of weather prohibiting a launch this afternoon due to thunderstorms and anvil clouds. There is a 60-percent chance of weather prohibiting launch should there be a 24-hour turnaround, and a 40-percent chance with a 48-hour delay. If we scrub today due to weather, mission managers will meet later to decide if they want to make a third consecutive launch attempt or stand down for one day and try again on Tuesday."

At 1:14 p.m., the launch director made a final decision to scrub again due to unfavorable weather conditions.  The next launch attempt was scheduled for around 2:38 p.m. on July 4.

July 3 (No launch attempt).
The shuttle's fuel cells were replenished to improve the chances of having enough electrical power on orbit to enable the third planned space walk to take place.



Cracks and a region where a piece of foam had come off were discovered in the insulation on the upper part of the external fuel tanks. The foam came off a bracket which held an oxygen line in place. The fragment that fell off weighed 0.0056 pounds (2.6 grams) and, according to NASA, would not be big enough to damage the shuttle if it were to come off during flight. The thermal stresses of repeated filling and emptying the fuel tank with the cryogenic fuel are known to cause a degree of damage to the insulation foam.

July 4 (Launch and flight day 1).


At 8:35 a.m. the backup circuit breaker controlling the primary heaters on the segment joints of both solid rocket boosters was noticed to have failed. Consideration was given to a repair on the pad.  However, this was not done as the heaters are only used in colder weather, and the primary heater was functional.

For the third launch attempt, there was only a 20% chance of weather preventing launch according to NASA.

At 2:37:55 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Space Shuttle Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. This was the third attempt at launch. It was also the first US Space Shuttle to launch on the United States' Independence Day.

During and after launch much attention was paid to monitoring the external tank for the loss of insulation foam. The shuttle was equipped with a number of new cameras, and video was also taken from spotter planes. Each solid rocket booster contained three cameras - one to monitor the separation, and two focused on the leading edge.  The video from these was not to be broadcast, but recorded for later retrieval from the solid rocket boosters. A further camera was placed on the external tank, as during STS-114, to broadcast live images on NASA TV during launch. The first thing two of the crew from the mid-deck did when the main engines cut out was leave their seats to take photographs and video of the external tank. One of the factors that was potentially affecting the choice of day within the launch window was the lighting conditions for this imagery, as the sun's slightly different angle on the different days affected the location of shadows on the external tank. However, the day to day difference in lighting was determined to be relatively unimportant, particularly as the lighting conditions depended to a great degree on a more unpredictable factor   the degree to which the external tank tumbles on separation.

During the launch, NASA TV broadcast a view from the external tank camera mounted between the Shuttle and the external tank. Unlike the previous two missions, no foam breakage or foam pieces were easily seen falling off the tank. However, upon close inspection of the many cameras covering the launch NASA has revealed several small pieces of debris were seen jetting away from the tank.  Generally, though, these were seen after the time NASA was most concerned about.



About 23 minutes into the flight, further debris was observed floating beside the orbiter as reported by Mission Specialist Michael Fossum. His transmission was broadcast live on NASA TV. Fossum initially described the debris as a 4-5 ft long piece with straps attached, a description which would fit a thermal protection system blanket. Such a blanket was noted to be flapping on the previous mission, STS-114, but was not of concern as it protects a section of the vehicle which does not get particularly hot. Analysis of video images on the ground has indicated that the debris observed was strips of ice formed on the outside of an engine nozzle, which sublimated and disintegrated during observation. Very similar ice formations were seen on earlier missions.

Video analysis also revealed a tile shim which came out during main engine start. 

The orbital maneuvering system thruster in which a heater failed prior to launch (see Pre-launch concerns) was warmed by pointing it at the sun; thus it was possible to be used during ISS rendezvous docking operations.

July 5 (flight day 2).

En-route to the ISS, the 50-foot-long Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) tipped with two types of lasers and a high-resolution television camera was used to inspect the underside of the shuttle for damage. Particular attention was paid to the leading edges of the shuttle's wings.

The post mission management team briefing after flight day 2 revealed that the inspections had found that a gap filler was protruding on the port side lower wing, not a location of particular concern. The gap filler was not from an area which has been modified since STS-114; it had been with the vehicle since 1982. The height and location of the gap filler was to be investigated further and, if necessary, dealt with using the procedure established and proven by STS-114, during a spacewalk.

An analysis of the inspections revealed the presence of bird droppings on the leading edge of the right wing.  The launch director has said he saw droppings in that location before launch. During the crew press conference on landing day the crew joked about the bird droppings indicating that they were still present on the orbiter though rather charred.

July 6 (flight day 3).
Rendezvous with the ISS. The shuttle performed a Rendezvous pitch maneuver prior to docking to allow the ISS crew to briefly inspect and photograph the Shuttle's heat shield. That maneuver began at 1402 GMT. An uneventful docking with the space station was performed, and upon hatch opening commander Steven W. Lindsey performed a gymnastic roll for the camera and gave a thumbs up. Thomas Reiter officially became a member of the International Space Station Expedition 13 crew shortly after docking, the transfer of his personalised Soyuz spacecraft seat liner, which cushions the landing indicated the official transfer point.

July 7 (flight day 4).
The  Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Leonardo was mated to the space station's Unity module. There were concerns that some straps were in the way of the docking equipment, but following video inspections of the straps they were determined not to be a problem and docking continued as planned. The straps may be removed in the future. 

A number of "focused inspections" of the Shuttle's heat shield has started. A second gap filler, described as being located near the arrowhead, is one of these points. This gap filler is thought to be protruding 1 cm - the location close to the nose making it of concern due to the potential for early disruption of the boundary layer over the base of the whole vehicle during reentry.  There are six focused inspections being carried out, fewer than were required in STS-114. By the end of day four the gap filler observation was thought to be due to  a fabric capping on a "tadpole" gap filler (a ceramic gap filler plate) wrapped with fabric along one edge to provide a tighter fit and a smoother surface. 

The results of analysis of data collected by the wing leading edge sensors was discussed in the post mission management meeting briefing at the conclusion of day four. The sensors were revealed to have picked up six impacts. The maximum g observed was 1.6 g, compared to ground testing where of the order of 10 g were required to cause damage. Nevertheless, the inspection team on orbit will be taking a close look at the regions of interest, which are on both wings.

July 8 (flight day 5).
Michael Fossum and Piers Sellers performed a seven and a half hour space walk. They evaluated the use of the 50-foot Orbital Boom Sensor System extension to the robotic arm as a work platform in case repairs are needed to the shuttle. The first step was to attach the foot restraints to the arm. First Piers Sellers worked alone; then Mike Fossum joined him - when both are on the arm they attempted increasingly vigorous operations that simulate various potential repair scenarios.

Initial reports from Michael Fossum and Piers Sellers suggested that the boom was damping out motion rapidly, making it a good work platform. Piers Sellers said at one point: "I felt almost no motions at all, just a few inches each way, very few motions". When standing on the boom while it was moving they described it as very smooth.

Fossum had a problem with his 85 foot long safety tether, which was damaged after he made a mistake; not realising he had left the tether in a locked position, he expected it to be automatically drawn tight. Upon realising the mistake Fossum said: "Oh no! ... That's embarrassing".  The damaged tether had to be switched for a spare.   

The other major task was to make safe a cable cutter on one site of the ISS's mobile transporter.

July 9 (flight day 6).
The morning's flight plan revision, emailed up to the crew contained the following request which many on Earth will be able to relate to:

If possible, please keep your Inbox, Sent Items, and Work Related folders as clean and empty as possible (either by deleting items or moving them to your personal folders). This is needed to reduce the time required to uplink new e-mail.

One of the day's highlights was a press conference from orbit, with questions from JSC, KSC, and the ESA. 

Robotics operations continued, with the Canadarm2 releasing the mobile transporter from one end, while remaining attached with the other end to the Destiny module in preparation for the following day's work on the mobile transporter system. Other preparations for the second space walk continued, including the setting up of equipment, and cameras. 

Additionally a new spacesuit being delivered to the ISS was transferred and underwent "checkout" procedures.

July 10 (flight day 7).
Sellers and Fossum performed a six hour, forty-seven minute space walk. They deployed a spare pump module and replaced a reel of umbilical cable carrying power, data and video for operating the station's Mobile Transporter rail car.

July 11 (flight day 8).
The crews prepared for the third and final spacewalk to be conducted during STS-121 s visit to the station, expected to begin at 7:13 a.m. July 12.

The astronauts also continued cargo transfers between the shuttle, the International Space Station and the Leonardo multi-purpose logistics module. Leonardo arrived with more than 7,400 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station. Leonardo will be returned Friday to the payload bay packed with more than 4,300 pounds of science experiment results, unneeded items and trash.

At 10:35 a.m. EDT, President George W. Bush had a private telephone conversation with the crew, during which he told the astronauts that they represent the best of service and exploration, and thanked them for the job they are doing.

Pilot Mark E. Kelly suggested during an on-orbit press conference that the wake-up songs should be made known to the crew before they are woken up by them when he said:
Sometimes we know ahead of time what the music is going to be and who it's for, other times it's a complete surprise and you just get woken up by it and have to scrabble around thinking of something profound to say about it.

July 12 (flight day 9).
A spacewalk to demonstrate shuttle repair techniques was carried out by Sellers and Fossum. Repairs were done on pre-damaged samples of heat shield materials brought into space on a special pallet in the payload bay of the shuttle. The repairs under test are expected to perform best when the material has been warm and is cooling, so the actions were carefully coordinated by mission control with regard to exposure of the samples to the sun.  While the procedures, and NOAX (Non-Oxide Adhesive Experimental) material has been tested in a vacuum on earth, the zero G tests are required because of off gases generated by the material and the potential for bubbles to form that could weaken the structure of the repair.

Following a problem on the previous EVA where latches on a SAFER became detached, Kapton tape was used to ensure the latches remained closed on this EVA. Kapton tape was used rather than the duct tape (which the shuttle program calls "grey tape") as it is smoother. 

Piers lost one of the spatulas he was using to put the NOAX onto the samples of heat shield material. As he lost it he said, "Guys I've got to tell you my spatula's escaped." He tried to locate it himself with the assistance of Fossum, who said "Don't worry it happens."  Mission controllers saw the spatula float away over the port side of the shuttle payload bay. The tool is not expected to cause any problems. Calculations were conducted and mission control reported to the EVA crew that "We have no FOD (Foreign Object Debris) hazard in the payload bay." Piers apologised for letting go of the tool and causing the extra work on the ground associated with calculating whether the loose tool posed a hazard.

July 13 (flight day 10).

The Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-121) crew enjoyed a well deserved day off after having completed three successful space walks and transferring thousands of pounds of supplies and equipment earlier in the flight.

Events taking place on this day were interviews for both the International Space Station (ISS) and Shuttle crews.

Mission Specialist Mike Fossum received a call from Texas Governor Rick Perry, who like Fossum, is a graduate of the Texas A&M University.  He mentioned to Fossum how proud he was to have the first Aggie in space.  Aggies are all up in great arms to have the first Aggie in space,  said Perry.  You are making some history, Michael. 

Later in the afternoon, Fossum and Nowak participated in live interviews with MSNBC and Fox News Live.

Expedition 13 crewmember Jeffrey Williams confirmed steps and final procedures for closeout of the MPLM which will be relocated from the International Space Station to Discovery s payload bay.

July 14 (flight day 11).
Transfer of Leonardo to the shuttle payload bay was completed in preparation for Discovery s departure from the International Space Station. Wilson and Nowak used the ISS robotic arm to complete the transfer of the module packed with over 4000 pounds of material to return to Earth.

Wilson and Nowak also used the shuttle's arm and extension boom to inspect the shuttle s port wing for any signs of micro-meteoroid damage while on-orbit. The other wing and the nose cap will be inspected on flight day twelve following undocking. 

The major discussion on the ground was around a small leak, a "APU 1 fuel tank pressure decay", in either a nitrogen or hydrazine tank, in one of the three redundant auxiliary power units which generate hydraulic power for use controlling the flight control surfaces during landing. The chances are that it is a nitrogen leak; however it is being treated as a hydrazine leak as that is a worst case scenario - hydrazine being flammable and corrosive.

It is possible, depending on the way the system behaves during the checkout planned for flight day 12, that the shuttle team will burn off the hydrazine in orbit. This would leave hydraulic system one non-operational during landing, forcing the shuttle to use pyrotechnics for the deployment of landing gear, and disabling powered steering of the nose wheel - though the vehicle would be controllable on landing through directional braking.

July 15 (flight day 12).
Space Shuttle Discovery's STS 121 crew undocked from International Space Station after a 9 day stay.  Undocking occurred over the Pacific Ocean just north of New Zealand.

Mark Kelly flew Discovery to a point above the station before performing the final separation burn. 

Crew members also used the robotic arm and the orbital boom sensor system to perform final inspections of the starboard wing and shuttle nosecap for any damage that may have been caused by orbital debris while docked with the International Space Station.

July 16 (flight day 13).
Troubleshooting of one of the Flash Evaporator Subsystem (FES) (FES PRI B) was carried out, 'A' would be used during reentry but it is desirable to have both functional. This was in addition to the usual extensive "checkout" of all those systems required for reentry ensuring they were functional. The main area of concern was APU-1, tests on APU-1 also increased confidence in its integrity to the point where mission controllers decided to use the unit as normal for the re-entry.

Other activities included a long series of live press conferences from orbit, and preparations for landing which include stowing items on the middeck, fitting the seats in place, and for the CDR and Pilot - practising a simulated landing. 

Discovery received a clean bill of health on the recent heat shield inspections and was given a "Go for landing", this was relayed to the crew while they were on their midday meal break. There were only two very minor deviations from a nominal landing procedure planned, APU one may be started early, and due to the problems with the heater thermostat on APU 3 the heater would have to be turned off manually by one of the crew. This switch will have to be thrown while the crew are suited up in their seats ready for landing. The crew said they would mark the switch with grey tape. The crew were told that only KSC was to be "called up" for a landing on the 17 July, meaning that in the case of unsuitable weather at KSC on the 17th the landing would have been delayed until the 18th. On the 18th Edwards Air Force Base was the prime alternative to KSC.  Showers were forecast in the area of KSC on the morning of the 17th, the crew were assured that the weather at Edwards looked good on both days.

July 17 (flight day 14 and landing).

The deorbit burn phase began successfully at 7:07am CDT, committing Discovery to land on the 17th.  At 8:08 AM CDT, Discovery was safely out of reentry and headed toward a landing at KSC runway 15.  The original landing target (Runway 33) was ruled out at the last minute due to showers south of KSC where the orbiter would have circled before landing. Shortly before landing the right air data probe initially failed to deploy.  It began functioning of its own accord a few minutes later.

Discovery landed successfully on schedule at 8:14:43am CDT with three good APUs throughout the landing procedure. During the post landing inspection tour, Lindsey remarked that this was one of the cleanest inspections he'd ever done.

During post landing press briefings it was revealed that:
Discovery's windows will be replaced before the next mission, STS-116, so that the old ones can be studied by engineers at Corning to find out the cause of small imperfections which appear during the mission. ;
The mission's demonstration that the shuttle's arm can be used as a work platform is a good sign for a potential future Hubble telescope mission.

Zoe Palaiologina (Greek                , Russian                         , c. 1455 - April 7, 1503), Grand Duchess of Moscow, was a niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI and second wife of Ivan III of Russia. 

Her father was Thomas Palaeologus, the Despot of Morea. Together with her brothers, she was taken to Rome after conquest of Morea by Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire in 1460. In Rome, her Greek name Zoe was changed to Sophia. In 1469, Pope Paul II offered the Russian monarch to marry her in order to unite the Orthodox and Catholic churches. The widowed Russian prince married unattractive and haughty Sophia at the Dormition Cathedral on November 12, 1472. The cardinal Johannes Bessarion, sent by the Pope to Moscow, however, did not succeed in his mission. 

Over the years, Sophia started to wield great influence on her aged husband. It is thought that she was the first to introduce the Kremlin to grand Byzantine ceremonies and meticulous etiquette. The idea of Moscow as the Third Rome evidently pleased her. Shortly before her death she persuaded her husband to pass the throne to her son Vasili, rather than to Ivan's grandson Dmitry, as had been planned earlier. Apart from Vasili III, only her fifth son, Andrey of Staritsa, left issue.

<doc id="4631133" title="Overtime ban" nonfiltered="1224" processed="1213" dbindex="451239">
An overtime ban is a form of industrial action where employees limit their working time to the hours specified in their contracts, refusing to work any overtime.  Overtime bans are less disruptive than strike action, and since there is no breach of contract by the employees there is less chance of disciplinary action by the employer than there is with strikes.  However, an overtime ban can have a significant impact on industries which normally operate outside of regular office hours, such as emergency services, public transport, or retail.

An overtime ban is similar to a work-to-rule, in that both involve employees refusing to do more than is strictly required of them.  However, and in contrast with a work-to-rule, when an overtime ban is in place workers may still perform duties not required of them, providing they do not go outside their contracted hours.

Written Chinese originated some 3,500 years ago in China. It employs about 5,000 commonly used characters that each represent a morpheme. Combinations of characters produce Chinese words. The writing system is considered to have been a unifying force for much of Chinese history, transcending differences in spoken language.  From the time of the Qin Dynasty onwards, a standard written language (at first Classical Chinese and later Vernacular Chinese) has been in place to bridge gaps between the various forms of spoken Chinese.

How the language works.

Unlike English words, which are composed of letters, written Chinese words are made up of characters.  It is popularly believed that Chinese characters represent words; in fact, however, individual characters represent Chinese morphemes and their meanings are generally dependent on context.  Most words are composed of two characters, though words are commonly made up of one, three, four or more.  This is not unique to Chinese; for instance, the English word "undoable" is made up of three morphemes meaning "not," "do," and "able."  In much the same way, Chinese     (zuòbùwán) "undoable" is composed of three characters or morphemes meaning "do," "not," and "finish."

Context and meaning.
As an example of how a Chinese character which does not commonly exist by itself to make a word, but is a part of a multi-syllable word, consider the character   (zh ng) which has a basic meaning of "central, middle".   A    (zh ngx n) is a "center" (e.g., a health center).     (zh ngm izh u) is "Central America".     (Zhongguo, literally "middle kingdom") is the Chinese word for "China" and   can be used as an abbreviation for "China";    (zh ngwén) meaning "Chinese language" and     (zh ngm i) meaning (zhongguo-meiguo) "Sino-American". When   is placed at the end of a subordinate phrase, it can mean "during" or "in the act of," as in    (zh ngduàn) "to interrupt" or    (zh ngdú) "to be poisoned." 

Common Chinese words are particularly flexible.  For instance,   (k ) on its own has the passive meaning "capable of being," as in    (k ch ) "edible," but in conjunction with   (y ) assumes the active meaning "able to," as in     (k y z u) "able to walk."

In many cases, Chinese characters shed their meaning because they are used to transliterate foreign words and names.     (bùshí) is "(George) Bush" and has no association with   (bù) "cloth" aside from its phonetic value.  Nonetheless, an attempt is often made in these phonetic loans to retain some semantic value, as in     (mín qún), "miniskirt," which literally means "fascinate-you-skirt."

A few Chinese characters represent more than one morpheme.  This too is not unique to Chinese: English "lead" represents two different morphemes (and words), meaning either "to guide or conduct" or "a particular kind of heavy elemental metal," and being pronounced differently in either case.  When a Chinese character--say,  --represents multiple morphemes, it typically is also pronounced differently depending on its meaning.  In this case, the character is pronounced xíng when it means "acceptable" or "to walk," but háng when it means "profession" or "row."  However, this need not be the case: the Chinese particle   (le) actually represents two morphemes, indicating either change of state or perfection of action, that are pronounced the same way in either case.

Components and the radical.

Just as most words are composed of two or more characters, most characters are composed of two or more roots.  This is an extra layer of indirection not present in alphabetic languages like English.  Historically, as with most languages, the spoken language developed first, and only later did a writing system evolve to denote the spoken language.  Chinese characters were considered to have been formed according to one of six basic principles.  Two principles governed characters composed of only a single root: the entire character itself.  These characters either depicted the object they represented--   (xiàngxíng), literally "appearance of shape"--or represented some abstract concept figuratively--   (zh shì), literally "indication of item."  An example of    is   (sh u) "hand," whose original form depicted a stick hand with five fingers; examples of    are   (shàng) "up" and   (xià) "down."

Two other principles governed methods of combining roots to form compound characters.  One--   (huìyì), literally "association of meaning"--signified characters in which the meanings of the component roots were combined to form a compound sense.  This is the sense in which English speakers are familiar with compound words; a Chinese example is   (hào) "be fond of," which is composed of a woman and child.

However, Chinese was apparently too rich a language for compounds to be derived solely through   .  Fortunately, the Chinese developed the notion of the rebus.  In this conception, a character was composed essentially of two parts.  One was a root that indicated the general semantic category of the character.  The rest of the character was a phonetic component (very often a fully fledged character on its own) used only for its pronunciation.  This principle--called in Chinese    (xíngsh ng), literally "shape sound"--was tremendously productive: By some estimates, about 90 percent of Chinese characters evolved through the principle of   .  The exact figure depends somewhat on the particular lexicon being analyzed, but there is certainly no question that most characters are derived in this manner.  An example is   (q ng) "clear", which is composed of a root meaning "water" and a root (another character,  ) also pronounced q ng.

Two final principles governed how existing characters might assume new meanings.  Strictly speaking, these principles do not produce any new characters.  One is    (zhu nzhù), literally "transfer into," which covered characters whose original meanings were extended, typically metaphorically, into newer, often more general senses.  The last principle was    (ji jiè), literally "false borrowing": In these cases, a character with an already established meaning was "borrowed" to cover a second unrelated morpheme for which there existed as yet no written character.

Looking up a word.

Because written Chinese is not an alphabetic language,  a Chinese dictionary uses other methods of arranging words.  Words are grouped into an entry based on its first character.  Each character has a part of it designated a primary root, called the "radical."  There is an index  of 214 distinct radicals, sorted by stroke count, and originally selected so that each character in the Chinese written system would contain at least one radical.  And indeed, every written character does contain at least one of the 214 radicals.  Some characters contain more than one radical, but even in these cases, one particular radical is designated as the primary radical for that character.

In principle, looking up a character in the dictionary when its sound is not known is a two-step process.  First, one identifies the radical for that character eg  .  The radical in this case  , as in many characters divided left-right, is on the left.  This radical can be located in the index of 214 radicals which are arranged by the number of strokes; three in this case. 
The next step is to look in a second index in which every character is sorted by radical, in this case all characters with the   (nü) "woman" radical.  There are scores of characters with this radical, so the characters under each radical are sorted according to the number of strokes in the remainder of the character--in this case,   (zi) "child," which also has three strokes. Then it is a matter of looking down the list until   is located, which will then give its main entry in the dictionary by pinyin or page number.

Beginning in the 20th century, a number of phonetic alphabets were developed for the various Chinese dialects.  For the most common dialect, Mandarin, both p ny n (used throughout this article) and zhùy n fúhào are used.  Modern dictionaries have the characters arranged by pinyin alphabetical order, or include an appendix in which all the characters are sorted according to one of these phonetic alphabets.  This further simplifies the task of looking up a character if the character's pronunciation is already known.  For an unknown character, the user must still find the character using the radical method.

In practice, looking up characters is complicated by a variety of considerations.  One is that it is not always obvious what the principal radical is.  It may occasionally be located on the top, bottom, right, or even inside of another root.  Typically, though not always, it is a root that represents the semantic category for the character.  Another difficulty is that several common radicals have variant forms, which must be recognized in order to find the proper chapter of the dictionary.  Still another problem is that counting strokes is an error-laden process: Some Chinese characters require upwards of 30 strokes to write correctly, and it is not always easy to determine whether part of a character is to be written with two separate strokes or a single angled one.  To ease the problem cases somewhat, there is typically an appendix containing a list of characters which are difficult to locate, sorted strictly by stroke count.  This still requires the user to count strokes carefully, but eliminates the issue of which root is the radical of the character.

Recognizing that radicals are at least somewhat arbitrary in nature, some lexicographers devised new schemes for Chinese dictionaries.  Most of these are poorly represented in print, although the four-corner method, in which characters are organized according to the kind of strokes used in the four corners of the character, has some enthusiastic adherents.

Written Chinese.

The relationship among the Chinese spoken and written languages is complex. It is compounded by the fact that spoken variations evolved for centuries, since at least the late Hàn Dynasty, while written Chinese changed less.

Until the 20th century, most formal Chinese writing was done in Classical Chinese or Literary Chinese (   wényán), which was very different from any spoken variety of Chinese, much as Classical Latin differs from modern Romance languages. Since the May Fourth Movement of 1919, the formal standard for written Chinese was changed to Vernacular Chinese (/ báihuà), which, while not completely identical to the grammar and vocabulary of dialects of Mandarin, was based mostly on them. The term standard written Chinese now refers to Vernacular Chinese.

Chinese characters represent morphemes or part of a morpheme independent of phonetic change. For example, although the number "one" is yi in Mandarin, yat in Cantonese and tsit in Hokkien (form of Min), they derive from a common ancient Chinese word and can be written with an identical character (" "). Nevertheless, the orthographies of Chinese dialect groups are not completely identical, and their vocabularies have diverged. In addition, while colloquial vocabularies are often different they also share vocabulary that is derived from the Classical written language . Colloquial non-standard written Chinese usually involves "dialectal characters" which are not used in other dialects or characters that are considered archaic in standard written Chinese. 

Cantonese is unique among non-Mandarin regional languages in having a written colloquial standard, used in Hong Kong and by non-Standard Mandarin speaking Cantonese speakers overseas, with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this variety of Chinese. By contrast, the other regional languages do not have such widely used alternative written standards. Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging, although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use standard written Chinese.

Also, in Hunan, some women wrote their local language in Nü Shu, a syllabary derived from Chinese characters. The Dungan language, considered a dialect of Mandarin, is also nowadays written in Cyrillic, and was formerly written in the Arabic alphabet, although the Dungan people live outside China.

 Written standards .

One can classify Chinese writing into the following basic types:
 Wényán (  ) (Classical Chinese);
 ;
 Poems and other Chinese constrained writings;

The relationship between the Chinese spoken and written languages is complex.  This complexity is compounded by the fact that the numerous variations of spoken Chinese have gone through centuries of evolution since at least the late Hàn Dynasty. However, written Chinese has changed much less than the spoken language.

Until the 20th century, most formal Chinese writing was done in wényán, translated as Classical Chinese or Literary Chinese, which was very different from any of the spoken varieties of Chinese in much the same way that Classical Latin is different from modern Romance languages.  Chinese characters that are closer to the spoken language were used to write informal works such as colloquial novels.

In the May Fourth Movement of 1919, the formal standard for written Chinese was changed to báihuà , or Vernacular Chinese, which, while not completely identical to the grammar and vocabulary of Standard Mandarin, was based mostly on the dialects of modern spoken Mandarin.  The term standard written Chinese now refers to Vernacular Chinese. Although few new works are now written in classical Chinese, it is still taught in middle and high school and forms part of college entrance examinations. Classical Chinese forms are also sometimes included in written works to give them a highly formal or archaic flavor.

The Chinese script also was the base for some other East Asian scripts like the scripts of Khitan and Jurchen, Kanji in Japan, Ch -nho in Vietnam and Nushu, a script since the 15th century exclusively for Chinese women in Hunan.

Transcending intelligibility of speech.
Chinese characters are understood as logosyllabic morphemes that are independent of phonetic change. Thus for example, although the number one is "y " in Mandarin, "yat" in Cantonese and "tsit" in Hokkien, they derive from a common ancient Chinese word and are written with the same character:  . Nevertheless, the orthographies of Chinese dialects are not identical. The vocabularies used in the different dialects have also diverged. In addition, while literary vocabulary is often shared among all dialects (at least in orthography), colloquial vocabularies vary widely. Colloquially written Chinese usually involves the use of "dialectal characters" which may not be understood in other dialects or characters that are considered archaic in báihuà.

The complex interaction between the Chinese written and spoken languages can be illustrated with Cantonese. In Hong Kong, Cantonese speakers are all taught standard written Chinese in school even though its grammar and vocabulary are based on Mandarin, which is not generally spoken in Hong Kong. As every character in standard written Chinese has a Cantonese pronunciation, standard written Chinese can be read aloud using Cantonese pronunciation but the result is very different from normal spoken Cantonese. For Cantonese speakers in Guangdong Province where nearly everyone can also speak Mandarin, this difference between the written and spoken language is much less pronounced as standard written Chinese can be read aloud in its standard pronunciation, which is Mandarin.

In most written communication, Cantonese speakers, whether they also speak Mandarin or not, will write in standard written Chinese.  A literate Chinese typically can read such communication without much difficulty. However, colloquially spoken Cantonese features different grammar and vocabulary, which, if written down, can be largely unreadable by an untrained non-Cantonese speaker. Standard written Chinese essentially functions as a different register for Cantonese speakers who don't speak Mandarin, because they do not write in the way they usually speak.  In Hong Kong, standard written Chinese spoken aloud using Cantonese pronunciation (usually with some colloquial words substituted in) serves as an acrolect used in newscasts and other formal contexts.

Written colloquial Cantonese does exist however, and Cantonese is unique among non-Mandarin regional languages in having a widely used written colloquial standard. This is due in part to the fact that Hong Kong, a large Cantonese speaking territory, was outside of Chinese control for over a hundred years before the British returned it to the People's Republic of China in 1997. In contrast, the other regional languages do not have such widely used alternative written standards. Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in certain tabloids, online chat rooms, and instant messaging. Even so, Cantonese speakers will use standard written Chinese in most formal written communications.

As with other aspects of the Chinese language, the contrast between different written standards is not sharp and there can be a socially accepted continuum between the written standards. For example, in writing an informal love letter, one may use informal báihuà .  In writing a newspaper article, the language used is different and begins to include aspects of wényán.  In writing a ceremonial document, one would use even more wényán.  The language used in the ceremonial document may be completely different from that of the love letter, but there is a socially accepted continuum existing between the two. Pure wényán, however, is rarely used in modern times.

Note: The concept of "language independence" for written Chinese was sharply criticized by John DeFrancis in his book The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy; he claims that the standard written Chinese is strongly tied to the Mandarin spoken language.

 Chinese characters (1).
Main articles: Chinese character, Punctuation: East Asian punctuation

The Chinese written language employs the Hàn characters (  /   pinyin hànzì), which are named after the Hàn culture to which they are largely attributed. Many Chinese characters appear to have originated as depicting concrete objects.  The first examples we have of Chinese characters are Sh ng dynasty inscriptions on oracle bones, which are animal bones used in osteomancy (divination using bones). The materials used were, with very few exceptions, the scapulas of oxen (leading to the term scapulimancy), and turtle plastrons (lower shells; thus the term plastromancy). From these shells and bones is derived the modern Chinese term for the earliest Chinese writing:     ji g wén (lit. "shell-bone-script", see Oracle bone script). 

Over the course of the Zh u and Hàn dynasties, the characters became more and more stylized. Abstract symbols, such as those indicating up and down, combined characters and phonetic loans were already fully developed in even the earliest known oracle bones. For example,   rén, meaning "person", originated from a pictogram (    xiàngxíngzì, lit. "like-shape-words") of a man; the concepts "trust", "trustworthiness" etc. are represented by  , a combination of "man" and "speech/word"; and  , the pictogram of a hand with the arm bent at the elbow, thus representing zh u "elbow", had already been borrowed for ji  "nine", which had the same or similar pronunciation. Also, additional components were added so that many characters contain one element that gives (or at least once gave) a fairly good indication of the pronunciation (the "phonetic component"), and another component (the "semantic" component) gives an indication of the general meaning of the character. Such     xíngsh ngzì, lit. "shape-sound-words" are termed picto-phonetic, phono-semantic, phonetic compounds, etc.. In the modern Chinese languages, the majority of characters are thusly phono-semantically based rather than logographically based. An example would be the character for the word   àn that means "to press down". It contains    n (peace), which serves as its phonetic component, and   sh u (hand), that indicates that the action is frequently one that is done using one's hand.  

A number of Chinese characters are derived out of each other; as a result some classical dictionaries contain circular references of words having identical radicals and meanings.  However, new meanings have been injected into these redundant words through popular usage.  Some words were also "borrowed" (ie. additional meanings were attributed thereto) because they bore phonetic resemblance with a concept that had no assigned written character.

Many styles of Chinese calligraphic writing developed over the centuries, such as seal script (  , seal-script), cursive script (  ), clerical script (  ) and regular script (  , aka k ish  or standard script).

In Japan and Korea, Hàn characters were adopted and integrated into their languages and became Kanji and Hanja respectively, the names being Japanised and Koreanised pronunciations of   . Japan still uses Kanji as an integral part of its writing system, while Korea's use of Hanja has diminished considerably: it was abolished in North Korea in the 1950s, but revived in the 1960s as cultural continuation proved inadequate without Chinese characters; South Korea has entirely deprecated Hanja use outside of obscure academic, medical or other jargon. 

In the field of software and communications internationalization, CJK is a collective term for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and the rarer CJKV for the same plus Vietnamese, all of which are double-byte languages, as they have more than 256 characters in their "alphabet". The computerized processing of Chinese characters involves some special issues both in input and character encoding schemes, as the standard 100+ key keyboards of today's computers do not allow input of that many characters with a single key-press.

The Chinese writing system is mostly logographic, i.e., each character expresses a monosyllabic word part, also known as a morpheme. This is helped by the fact that over 90% of Chinese morphemes are monosyllabic. The majority of modern words, however, are multisyllable and multigraphic. Multisyllabic words have a separate logogram for each syllable. Most Han Chinese characters have forms that were based on their pronunciation plus meaning combined, rather than their meanings alone, and they do not directly express ideas.

Character forms.

There are currently two standards for printed Chinese characters.  One is the Traditional Chinese characters (    fánt zì), used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.  Mainland China and Singapore use the Simplified Chinese characters (    ji nt zì) developed by the PRC government in the 1950s and finalised in the 1964 list.  Many simplified versions were derived from historically-established, albeit sometimes obscure, simplifications, mostly calligraphic simplifications (through cursive script), others through the replacement of a complex part of a character with a phonetically-similar glyph. In Taiwan, some simplifications are used when characters are handwritten, for the sake of speed and convenience, but in printing traditional characters are the norm.  In addition, most Chinese use some personal simplifications.

The simplification process is actually not restricted to the Simplified system.  In order to computerize Chinese, the authorities in Taiwan have tried to "standardize" the glyphs of characters being used, in order to eliminate unnecessary variations.  As a result, several characters are combined into one, and some characters have their written form altered to ease the glyph generation process by computing technologies at that time.  However, these simplification processes are rather minor as compared to those done by the Mainland government.

Writing direction.
Due to their unique block, square nature and the morphologically inactive nature of the language, Chinese characters are generally written without spaces at word boundaries, and can be written either horizontally or vertically and from right to left or left to right, or from top to bottom or bottom to top. Traditionally, writing was done vertically, going from top to bottom and arranged in columns going from right to left; on signboards etc. which were horizontal, the columns were reduced to a character each, effectively resulting in horizontal right-to-left writing. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, television subtitles still ran from right to left.

After the modernisation efforts of the PRC government in those same decades took a stronger hold there, however, horizontal left-to-right writing à la Latin has become usual practice. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, a parallel process developed with increased exposure to the West, especially the United States, and especially with the advent of technology. Singapore, for its part, has been dually influenced by both its tradition of adopting PRC guidelines with regard to Chinese writing, and by its predominantly Anglophone society. Despite the rise of horizontal writing (which facilitates inclusion of Hindu-Arabic numerals and Roman-lettered acronyms, inter alia), vertical right-to-left writing has persisted in Taiwan and Hong Kong especially in literature, due to the absence of government official policy on adopting horizontal writing.

Chinese characters (2).


The Chinese written language employs Chinese characters (/ pinyin: hànzì), which are logograms: each symbol represents a sememe or morpheme (a meaningful unit of language), as well as one syllable; the written language can thus be termed a morphemo-syllabic script.

They are not just pictographs (pictures of their meanings), but are highly stylized and carry much abstract meaning. Only some characters are derived from pictographs.  In 100 AD, the famed scholar X  Shèn in the Hàn Dynasty classified characters into 6 categories, only 4% as pictographs, and 82% as phonetic complexes consisting of a semantic element that indicates meaning, and a phonetic element that arguably once indicated the pronunciation.

All modern characters are or are based on the standard script (/ k ish ) (see styles, below). There are currently two standards for Chinese characters. One is the traditional system, still used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau. The other is the simplified system first introduced by the government of the People's Republic of China in the 1950s and finalized in 1986. The simplified system requires fewer strokes to write certain components and has fewer synonymous characters. Singapore, which has a large Chinese community, is the first and only foreign country to recognize and officially adopt the simplified characters.

Various written styles are used in Chinese calligraphy, including seal script (/ zhuànsh ), cursive script (/ c osh ), clerical script (/ lìsh ), and standard script (/ k ish , aka regular script). Calligraphers can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.

As with Latin script, a wide variety of typefaces exist for printed Chinese characters, a great number of which are often based on the styles of single calligraphers or schools of calligraphy.

There is no concrete record of the origin of Chinese characters. Legend suggests that C ng Jié, a bureaucrat of the legendary emperor Huángdì of China about 2600 BC, invented Chinese characters. A few symbols exist on pottery shards from the Neolithic period in China, but whether or not they constitute writing or are ancestral to the Chinese writing system is a topic of much controversy among scholars (see also proto-writing). Archaeological evidence, mainly the oracle bones found in the 19-20th centuries, at present only dates Chinese characters to the Sh ng dynasty, specifically to the 14th to 11th centuries BC, although this fully mature script implies an earlier period of development.

The vast majority of oracle bone inscriptions were found in the ruins of Y n of the late Sh ng Dynasty, although a few Zh u dynasty-related ones were also found. The forms of the characters in the inscriptions changed slightly over the 200 to 300 years, and scholars date the inscriptions of the Sh ng to the ruler by the content, particularly from the name of the diviners who inscribed the shell or bone artifacts.

Contemporaneous with the late Sh ng and the Western Zh u periods are a number of bronze inscriptions. Over the last century, a great many ancient bronze artifacts have been unearthed in China which contain dedicational texts of the Zh u aristocrats where the characters show similarities and innovations compared to the oracle bone inscriptions. In the period between the oracle bones and the bamboo books of the Warring States period, inscriptions on bronzes are the most important record of the written script. Note however that since this spans such a broad period of time, it is hardly meaningful to speak of bronzeware script or bronze script as a single entity.

Romanization.
Romanization is the process of transcribing a language in the Latin alphabet. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese languages; this is due to the complex history of interaction between China and the West, and to the Chinese languages' lack of phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western Christian missionaries of the 16th century, but may have been written down by Western travelers or missionaries of earlier periods.

At present, the most common romanization system for Standard Mandarin is Hanyu Pinyin /, also known simply as Pinyin. Pinyin is the official Mandarin romanization system for the People's Republic of China, and the official one used in Singapore (see also Chinese language romanisation in Singapore). It was adopted by the International Standards Organization in 1979, shortly after the United Nations and the normalization of relations between the US and the PRC.  Pinyin is now commonly used when teaching Mandarin in schools and universities of North America and Europe.  It is also the system which the Library of Congress and American Library Association now use for Chinese materials.

Perhaps the second-most common system of romanization for Mandarin is Wade-Giles. This system was probably the most common system of romanization for Mandarin before Hanyu Pinyin was developed. Wade-Giles is often found in academic use in the U.S., and until recently was widely used in Taiwan (Taipei city now officially uses Hanyu Pinyin and the rest of the island officially uses T ngyòng Pinyin /).

Here are a few examples of Hanyu Pinyin and Wade-Giles, for comparison:




Regardless of system, tone transcription is often left out, either due to difficulties of typesetting or propriety for audience. Wade-Giles' extensive use of easily-forgotten apostrophes adds to the confusion. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with Beijing than they will be with B ij ng, and with Taipei than with T'ai²-pei³.

Regardless of romanization, the words are pronounced the same. Learning a system of romanization requires occasional deviations from the learner's own language, so, for example, Hanyu Pinyin uses  q  for very different values than an English speaker would probably be used to; the sound represented is similar to the English  ch  but pronounced further forward (an aspirated alveolo-palatal fricative, /t  /). This is a cause of confusion but is unavoidable, as Mandarin (and any language transcribed) will have phonemes different from those of the learner's own. On the other hand, this can be beneficial, since learners can immediately be made aware of the fact that they will have to learn a new pronunciation. With languages that use similar orthography, the temptation to pronounce words just as in one's mother tongue can lead to great misunderstanding.

There are many other systems of romanization for Mandarin, as well as systems for Cantonese, Minnan, Hakka, and other Chinese languages. See the article category .

Other transcriptions.
Chinese languages have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The Phagspa script, for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciation of pre-modern forms of Chinese.

Zhuyin (; also known as bopomofo) is still widely used in Taiwan's elementary schools. A comparison table of Zhuyin to Pinyin exists in the Zhuyin article. Syllables based on Pinyin and Zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:
Pinyin table;
Zhuyin table;

There are also at least two systems of cyrillization for Chinese. The most widespread is the Palladius system. Since the Dungan language is usually considered a dialect of Mandarin Chinese, the Dungan alphabet can also be considered a cyrillization of one dialect of the Chinese language, albeit one used in a very specific context.

Giovanni Carrara  (born March 4, 1968 in Anzoátegui State, Venezuela) is a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who currently plays with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Carrara bats and throws right handed. He has established himself as a valuable middle relief man.

Failed starter converted to an effective long reliever, Carrara is a 90-92 MPH fireballer. He also throws a couple of breaking balls: a deceptive slow curve, as his off-speed pitch, and a hard one that is somewhere between a slider and cut fastball. He controls the running game as well, with a good move to both first base and second, and a quick delivery to the plate. On August 26, 2006, Carrara was designated for assignment by the Dodgers.



Fact.
On August 15, 2001, Carrara combined with fellow Venezuelan pitchers Omar Daal, Kelvim Escobar and Freddy García to win their respective starts: Carrara, of the Dodgers, facing  Montreal, 13-1; Daal, in a Phillies victory over the Brewers, 8-6; Escobar, of the Blue Jays, over Oakland, 5-2, and García, of Seattle, against the Red Sox, 6-2. This marked the first time in major league history that four pitchers coming from Venezuela have recorded a winning game in their respective starts in the same day.

James R. Caldwell (   7 August 1804) was an officer in the United States Navy, who served in the Quasi-War with France and the First Barbary War. 



Caldwell was appointed a midshipman 22 May 1798. During the Quasi-War with France, he served in the frigate United States, schooner Experiment and armed ship Ganges in the West Indies.

Commissioned a lieutenant in 1800, from late 1801 into 1803 Lieutenant Caldwell was an officer of the frigate Constellation during the initial phase of the war with Tripoli. In mid-1803, he returned to the Mediterranean in the brig Siren to participate in further operations against that piratical North African state. Caldwell distinguished himself in a boat action on 7 July 1804 and also took part in an attack on 3 August that resulted in the capture of three vessels that were taken into the Navy as gunboats. One of these, Gunboat Number 9, was under Caldwell's command when the U.S. squadron again bombarded Tripoli on 7 August 1804. While hotly engaged with an enemy battery, a hot shot penetrated her magazine and Gunboat Number 9 blew up. Lieutenant Caldwell and eleven others were killed or mortally wounded in the explosion.

Two ships have been named USS Caldwell for him.

Princess Anne redirects here. For other princesses called Anne, and other meanings of this name, see Princess Anne (disambiguation).;

The Princess Anne, Princess Royal (Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise Laurence; née Windsor, later Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Phillips; 15 August 1950), is a member of the British Royal Family and the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II. She is the seventh holder of the title Princess Royal, and is currently ninth in the line of succession to the British Throne.  At the time of her birth she was third in line, but moved to second place from when her mother became Queen until the birth of her brother, Prince Andrew, in 1960.

The Princess Royal is most famous for her charitable work. She is the only member of the British Royal Family to have competed in the Olympic Games.

Early life.
Princess Anne was born on 15 August 1950 at Clarence House, London. Her father is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and the former Princess Alice of Battenberg. Her mother was The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (now Queen Elizabeth II), the eldest daughter of King George VI and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. 

She was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on 21 October 1950 by Cyril Garbett, Archbishop of York. Her godparents were: The Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Andrew Elphinstone, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Gottfried of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

Shortly before the birth of her elder brother, Charles, Prince of Wales, in 1948, King George VI issued Letters Patent granting the titular dignity of Prince or Princess of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the style Royal Highness to any children born to the Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Princess Anne was educated in Buckingham Palace and then at Benenden School, a public boarding school in Kent.

Princess Anne.
On 6 February 1952, when Anne's grandfather, King George VI, died, her mother ascended the throne. Anne was now styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Anne. Given her young age, she did not attend her mother's coronation. Princess Anne began to undertake royal and official duties as a teenager in the late 1960s. 

Anne was also keen on horses, and equine pursuits have been an important part of her life. At the age of 21, she won the individual title at the European Eventing Championship held at Burghley and was voted BBC's BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1971 (Her daughter Zara Phillips, would win the same award 35 years later, on 10 December 2006). For over five years she competed with the British eventing team, winning a silver medal in both individual and team disciplines in the 1975 European Eventing Championships held in Germany riding the homebred Doublet. The following year she participated in the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games as a member of the British team riding the Queen's horse Goodwill.


First marriage.
On 14 November 1973 Princess Anne married Mark Phillips, a Lieutenant and later Captain in the 1st Queen's Dragoon Guards at Westminster Abbey, London. The marriage was televised around the world with an estimated audience of 100 million. The couple have two children, both of whom, like their mother, were born on the 15th day of a month:
Peter Phillips (born 15 November 1977);
Zara Phillips (born 15 May 1981);

As is customary, The Queen is believed to have offered Mark Phillips an earldom on his wedding day, which he turned down. This may also have been the specific wish of Princess Anne, who wanted to shield future children from the publicity that courtesy titles might bring. They thus become the first grandchildren of a sovereign to carry no title.

After their wedding, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, as he has subsequently styled himself, lived at Gatcombe Park, in Gloucestershire.

Kidnap attempt.

Princess Anne was the target of a failed kidnap attempt on 20 March 1974. To this day, it remains the closest any individual has come to kidnapping a member of the Royal Family. 

The incident occurred as Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were returning to Buckingham Palace from a London charity event on Pall Mall. Their Rolls Royce was forced to stop by a Ford Escort.. The driver of the Escort, Ian Ball (later judged to be mentally unstable) jumped from his car, firing a gun. Inspector James Beaton, the Princess' private detective, responded by jumping out to shield the Princess as he tried to disarm Ball. However, his gun jammed and he was shot in the head and chest. The chauffeur, Alex Callender was also shot as he tried to disarm Ball. Journalist Brian McConnell, who was passing by, also tried to intervene and was shot once in the chest. As Ball told the Princess of his kidnapping plan and asked her to get out of the car, she replied "Not bloody likely!" and briefly considered hitting Ball. Eventually, the Princess dived out of the car on the other side. A second passer-by, Ron Russell, punched Ball in the back of the head and led Anne away from the scene. PC Michael Hills discovered the scene, but was shot by Ball. However he managed to call for backup. A nearby police officer, DC Peter Edmonds gave chase and finally arrested Ball. 

Ball later pleaded guilty to attempted murder and attempted kidnap and was detained under the Mental Health Act. He was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, where he remains. Ball planned to ransom the Princess for a sum given in various sources as £2 million  or £3 million.  to the NHS. The incident prompted higher security levels for the Royal Family. Beaton was awarded the George Cross. Alex Callender, Brian McConnell, Ron Russell, PC Michael Hills, and DC Peter Edmonds were awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal.

Princess Royal.

On 13 June 1987, the Queen bestowed the title of Princess Royal on Princess Anne, the seventh creation of this title. Anne was now to be styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal. The title is only given to the eldest daughter of the sovereign, the last holder being King George V's daughter, Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood.

In 1996, Princess Anne served as Her Majesty's High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

Divorce and remarriage.
In August, 1989, the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips announced their intention to separate. The marriage had been under strain for many years. The couple divorced in April, 1992. On 12 December 1992, Anne remarried, the first royal divorcee since Victoria of Edinburgh to do so. She chose to remarry in the Church of Scotland since the Church of England forbade divorcees from remarrying in their churches, a stance that is now softening. 

She married Timothy Laurence in Crathie Kirk near the Balmoral Estate, Aberdeenshire. At the time of their marriage, he was a Royal Navy commander, and has since risen to the rank of Rear Admiral. They have no children together.

Charity work.
The Princess Royal carries out the most engagements of any member of the Royal Family. This current popularity is a contrast to her previous reputation when she earned the nickname Princess Sourpuss.

The Princess Royal is involved with over 200 charities and organisations in an official capacity.  The Princess Royal works extensively for the charity Save the Children of which she has been president since 1970.  The Princess Royal Trust for Carers  was created on the initiative of HRH The Princess Royal in 1991. Her work for the charity takes her all over the world, including many poverty stricken African nations. Also her extensive work for St. John Ambulance as Commandant-in-Chief of St. John Ambulance Cadets has helped to develop many young people as she annually attends the Grand Prior Award Reception. She is also a British representative in the International Olympic Committee as an administrator, and is a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.

Since 1981, she has served as the chancellor of the University of London.

The Princess Royal is also patron of the Scottish Rugby Union and attends most international games at Murrayfield. She is patron of the Wooden_Spoon_Society the Charity of British and Irish rugby.

Honorary military appointments.

Like other senior royals, The Princess Royal holds a number of honorary appointments in the British Armed Forces and those of several Commonwealth countries. In 2002, she made history by being the first non-reigning woman to wear military uniform at a funeral, when she wore a Royal Navy uniform at the funeral of her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.

She is Colonel-in-Chief of the following regiments, corps, and branches:
United Kingdom;

Court cases.
In 2001, the Princess Royal became the first member of the royal family to face criminal charges since King Charles I was charged with treason in 1649. She pleaded guilty to driving at 93 mph on a dual carriageway on her way to Hartpury College in Gloucestershire. She was fined £400 by Cheltenham Magistrates' Court and was given five points on her driving licence.

In 2002, the Princess Royal was convicted of a second criminal offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. She pleaded guilty to the charge that her dog, Dotty, attacked two boys while she and her husband were taking her for a walk in Windsor Great Park. The Princess Royal was fined £500 by Berkshire Magistrates' Court and ordered to give more training for Dotty. In December 2003, one of the Queen's Corgis had to be put down, after being savaged by another of the Princess Royal's dogs, Florence.

Barby is a village and civil parish in the Daventry district of Northamptonshire, England. In 2001 it had a population of 2,083.

Barby is located approximately 5 miles (8km) south of Rugby, and about 7 miles north of Daventry. The village is located upon a hill overlooking the Rains Brook and Leam valleys. The Oxford Canal is near. The village contains two garden centres, a pub, a general shop and Post Office, and a Church of England primary school. The village church is dedicated to St Mary. In 1965 Owen Maclaren designed and patented the first baby buggy at Arnold House, a restored medieval farmhouse. The village is twinned with Vulaines sur Seine in France.

The earth works from a Norman castle can be found on the northern edge of the village, off Castle Mound road.  

Its name came from Old Norse Bergbýr = "hill dwelling"; like Rugby, Kilsby, Badby and Oadby it was likely settled or renamed by Vikings.

<doc id="1347388" title="Makuhita" nonfiltered="1233" processed="1222" dbindex="451248">


 are one of the  fictional species of Pokémon creatures from the multi-billion-dollar Pokémon media franchise   a collection of video games, anime, manga, books, trading cards and other media created by Satoshi Tajiri. The purpose of Makuhita in the games, anime and manga, as with all other Pokémon, is to battle both wild Pokémon, untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments, and tamed Pokémon owned by Pokémon trainers. 

Its name relates to a rank of sumo wrestling, Makushita. It is speculated that the "s" in Makushita was dropped in order to avoid pronunciation mishaps when the Pokémon was translated to English. The name Makuhita refers to both the species, and to individual characters in the games, anime and manga. 

In the Pokémon universe, Makuhita are moderately large, plump creatures with more weight than a standard full-grown human. They have yellow bodies with gray boxing-glove-like hands, and gray bib-like markings on their collar, two red ring markings on its cheeks, a head with a bowtie-shaped outgrowth, and a peculiar facial expression worn constantly. The appearances of Makuhita and, more notably, its evolved form Hariyama, are inspired by the traditional Japanese sumo wrestler.

Characteristics.
Makuhita have been described as having a spirit that is tireless, gutsy, and tenacious. Its daily routine is said to involve a lot of harsh training, much like the Pokémon Machop, and their training increases their power and durability. It is thought that Makuhita regularly train in the secluded environs of a cave, and people around these caves have often reported hearing rumbling tremors from within the caves. Its bodily training is noted to always be accompanied by ample food consumption and sleep, for it is the goal of a Makuhita to gain enough weight and body mass to evolve into its bigger, fatter form of Hariyama.

Even when it has not yet achieved evolution into the stronger Hariyama, Makuhita are theoretically buff enough to withstand attacks launched against it. When engaged in battle with opponents, it would continuously attempt to attack its foe even if it is continuously knocked down. They are said to never give up hope, even against physically superior opponents.

 In the Pokémon video games .



Makuhita is commonly found on the upper floors of Granite Cave, in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, as well as occasionally in the top floor of the Victory Road. In Ruby and Sapphire, a Makuhita named Makit can also be traded for a Slakoth with a trainer named Elyssa in Rustboro City. Makuhita can also be captured in other games, for instance it can be snagged as a Shadow Pokémon, a Pokémon who's heart is closed, in both Pokémon Colosseum, and Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. The Dewford City Gym leader Brawly also owns a Makuhita in his party.

Makuhita has exceptionally high Hit Point and Attack ratings among basic Pokémon but very low statistics everywhere else, making it moderately hard to train for evolution into Hariyama at level 24. Makuhita (and Hariyama) can learn moves such as Fake Out, Knock Off, and Smellingsalt, which can make it a powerful battler against popular Pokémon such as Blissey and Skarmory.
In Pokémon Mystery Dungeon on the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, a Makuhita runs the dojo in Pokémon Square.

It is also notable that it is the 1st snagable Pokemon in Pokemon Colloseum

 In the Pokémon anime .
The Pokémon anime series and films are a meta-series of adventures separate from the canon that most of the Pokémon video games follow (with the exception of Pokémon Yellow, a game based on the anime storyline).  The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum an in-training Pokémon Master as he and his friends travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners.

Makuhita first appeared in Episode 296. "Brave the Wave", when Ash Ketchum and his friends arrived in Dewford Town. Ash soon met Brawly, the Dewford Town gym leader, who owned a Makuhita, along with other Fighting-type Pokémon. Makuhita and Brawly trained together, by surfing the surrounding waves of the island, using this ability to dodge the attacks of opponents. When Ash battled Brawly for the first time, his Treecko was defeated by Makuhita, which then evolved into Hariyama. 

 In other media .


In the Pokémon Adventures, a manga series based on the Advanced Generation games, Sapphire, the female protagonist, battles a Makuhita during her gym battle with Brawly in Chapter 195, "VS. Makuhita". Sapphire uses Ronono, her Lairon, and Chaka, her Combusken, against Makuhita, defeating Brawly. Despite this, at the end of the chapter, Brawly's Makuhita evolves into a Hariyama.

The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a collectible card game similar in goal to a Pokémon battle in the video game series; players must use cards (with individual strengths and weaknesses) in an attempt to defeat their opponent by "knocking out" all of his cards. The game was first published in North America by Wizards of the Coast in 1999, until Nintendo USA started publishing the series in 2003.  

Makuhita has appeared in the Pokémon Trading Card Game as Basic Fighting-type Pokémon several times. It first appeared in the "EX Ruby and Sapphire" set on three separate cards, then again in the "EX Deoxys", "EX Emerald", and "EX Delta Species" sets, every time as a Common card, meaning that it isn't particularly rare. Most Makuhita cards can only attack at full power through luck, as it required to flip a coin when using various attacks, the result producing different results which can help or hinder the player.

Several Makuhita products have been released.  A Makuhita action figure bundled with a Treecko figure is equipped with an Arm Thrust attack.

Mamakating is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 11,002 at the 2000 census. 

The Town of Mamataking is in the southeast part of the county. 

 History . 
The town of Mamakating was organized on March 7th, 1788 and was the first township of Sullivan County. The first county seat was Bloomingburgh; incorporated in 1833. According to historical records Johanis Hardenburgh, a resident of Kingston, N.Y., purchased a large tract of land known as the Hardenburgh patent. This land and another patent known as the Minisink patent were what is now most of Orange and Sullivan Counties. On December17th, 1743 a precinct was formed called Mamakating. Some say it was called Mamacotten.  It included what is now all of Sullivan County but was still a part of Ulster County.

During the early and middle 1700`s the construction of forts all along the old mine road (Route 209) was necessary to protect the settlers from hostile Indians. There were three forts built in Mamakating. Fort Westbrookville was built in 1750 on what is now the Sullivan and Orange county border and until several years ago it was a restaurant. In 1757 a fort was built north of the village of Wurtsboro and it was called Fort Devans. A building was later added to make it larger and it is now the home of the Barone family, the owners and operators of the Wurtsboro airport. Another fort was built on the east side of the Bloomingburgh Mountain. It was called Fort Roosa and was built in 1731. It is still standing and is considered the oldest building in Sullivan County. Many people traveling the old mine road from Kingston found land that was good for planting crops, plenty of game to hunt, streams filled with fish, and virgin trees to build homes. They decided that it was a good place to settle down and raise a family.

In 1788 Mamakating was reduced to its present size with the forming of Deerpark, Orange County in 1788. Lumberland was formed from Mamakating in 1798, Thompson in 1803 and part of Forestburgh in1837.

In 1788 the first school in Sullivan County was built in Bloomingburgh. In 1825 two brothers by the name of Wurts decided to build a canal.

This canal was known as the D and H Canal because it traveled between the Delaware and the Hudson Rivers. It carried coal from Pennsylvania to the people in New York City. The first canal boats loaded with coal arrived at the Hudson River in November 1828. On their return trip they brought back many of the things that were needed by the people of Sullivan County. By doing this, the canal made money each way on their trip. The D and H Canal helped bring prosperity to Mamakating and all of Sullivan County. In 1899 the railroad came and marked the beginning of the end for the D and H canal. In recent years there has been a effort by interested citizens of Sullivan County to save what is left of the D and H canal. There are many places where you can see what the D and H looked like. One is on the line between Summitville and Phillipsport where a lone stretch of the canal and the towpath, along with a dry-dock have been cleaned up. The county has posted signs explaining the various parts of the canal.
There are several historic places in Mamakating one of the most important is the grave of Manual Gonsalus, the first non-Indian settler. His tombstone is dated April 18,1752 and is one of the oldest tombstones in the state. Other historic places are the Phillipsport Church built in 1819 and the Bloomingburgh Reformed Church built in 1820 and now a county historic landmark. There is also an old cemetery located north of Wurtsboro called the Stanton Cemetery where many of the oldest settlers are buried. This is a popular place for genealogy hunters looking to locate links to their past. Up on the east mountain above the Wurtsboro airport there can still be seen the remains of the old lead mine. Some of the lead mined there was used to make the bullets used by the northern army during the civil war.

During the early 1800`s there were several hundred tanneries in Sullivan county with several in Mamakating. The leather from these tanneries was of superior quality and during the civil war was used to make many of the boots, saddles and other leather goods used by the Union Army. In fact Mamakating tanneries, in the year 1850, produced 29,000 hides of leather from five water and horse powered tanneries.

        

The Town of Mamakating town board asked me if I would care to form a historical society in the town of Mamakating. They took ownership of the old school building in Summitville and completely renovated it. I eagerly accepted the offer and today we have an archive room, a great meeting room with many pictures and histories of all the areas of Mamakating and many artifacts of our area. We have165 members and we are growing fast. I hope to someday have a web page for Mamakating keep tuned. John Masten Co-Historian

Millsdale is an abandoned village located in Channahon Township in Will County, Illinois.  

History.
Millsdale was named after Oscar Mills, a wealthy farmer on whose property both the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe and the Chicago and Alton railroads established small depots.  A post office was established in Millsdale in 1887.  Oscar mills also constructed a brick factory near the railroad, but it never proved to be particularly successful.  His other venture, however, a stockyard for cattle headed for Chicago was quite successful. According to residents who lived in Millsdale around 1916, the community also boasted a store and a few nearby houses.  The Mills home was said to be quite lavish.  Less fortunate immigrant railroad section workers, however lived in converted boxcars.  A one-room school was located at the edge of a nearby farm. The Station Master for the shared Santa Fe and C&A depot was on call 24 hours a day.  He could be called to tend to a train in the middle of the night if necessary.  In 1916 the Station Master lived in a house adjacent to the depot with his wife and children and paid $3 a month in rent (most likely to Mr. Mills). Millsdale never grew much beyond that, however.  The post office closed in 1902.  Oscar Mills son Arthur took control of the stock yards in the early 20th century, and they were active as late as 1928.  The community was still active through the 1920s, though still quite small. The real demise of Millsdale occurred in the late 1930s, when the U.S. Government bought up all the property in the area to create the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant.  Homes were razed, as was the school.  The depots ceased operation, too.  Today, there is nothing left to see in Millsdale, except for a few crumbling bricks.  Stepan Chemicals opened a plant in the area in the early 1950s and it is still in operation.  The plant, called the Millsdale Plant, is located on Millsdale Road.

Peter Pratt (March 21 1923 January 11 1995) was an English actor and singer who started his career in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, and later moved to radio and television work. He was born in Eastbourne and died in London.

D'Oyly Carte years.
Peter Pratt joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in September 1945, having had only amateur theatrical experience previously. He began to play small roles with the company in 1947. In the 1948 49 season, he became second understudy to Martyn Green and continued to play several of the smaller roles. He got his big break when he was called upon to play Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore on short notice in May 1949 (and several of the other "patter" roles that summer), when both Green and the principal understudy fell ill. He was soon given the primary understudy responsibilities, filling in for most of the comic "patter" roles, as well as playing several of the other smaller roles from time to time. 

In September 1951, exactly six years after joining the company, Pratt became the principal comedian following Green's departure, and he served in that capacity for the next eight seasons. He suffered an illness in the spring of 1959, and his last appearance with the company was on May 30 1959.  During his tenure with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Pratt recorded Major Murgatroyd (Patience, 1951), John Wellington Wells (The Sorcerer, 1953), King Gama (Princess Ida, 1955), Ko-Ko (The Mikado, 1957), and Major-General Stanley (The Pirates of Penzance, 1957).

Later years.
After leaving the D'Oyly Carte organisation, Pratt turned his attention to theatre, television, concert, and radio work. He was a member of the BBC Drama Repertory Company in the early 1960s. His love of Gilbert and Sullivan remained undiminished, however, and he frequently turned to their operas for inspiration. As a writer, narrator, and performer he presented a television play called Jack Point, and radio programs such as Afternoon at the Savoy, Evening at the Savoy, and Take a Sparkling Pair. Pratt also toured his own company, "Music Mosaic," presenting Gilbert and Sullivan and other works to audiences in Britain, North America, and Australia. He appeared in a full costume production of The Mikado at Royal Albert Hall. 

In 1966, BBC Radio presented a complete cycle of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with Pratt starring in most of them and working behind the scenes as co-producer. Pratt became probably the first professional to have sung the comic "patter" lead in all thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas, when he recorded Utopia Limited and The Grand Duke for that series. He also appeared as a soloist in the concert video recording "Gilbert & Sullivan Present their Greatest Hits," made at Royal Albert Hall in 1982.

He appeared in the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who in the role of the Master in the serial The Deadly Assassin, primarily because an actor with a strong voice was required to portray a character whose face was unseen for most of the serial.

Pratt was married to D'Oyly Carte soubrette Joyce Wright during his days with the Company. He later married Patience Sheffield, daughter of former D'Oyly Carte baritone Leo Sheffield.

Bernard Richard Meirion Darwin CBE JP (September 7 1876 18 October 1961)  a grandson of the British naturalist Charles Darwin, was a golf writer.

 Biography .
Darwin was the son of Francis Darwin and Amy Ruck, his mother dying from a fever on 11 September, four days after his birth.  Darwin was the first grandson of Charles Darwin (see Darwin   Wedgwood family) and was brought up by Charles and his wife Emma.  His younger half-sister was the poet Frances Cornford.

Darwin was educated at Eton College, and Cambridge University where he was a Cambridge Blue in golf  1895-1897 and captain in his final year.

He married the engraver Elinor Monsell in 1906.  Their children were Sir Robert Vere Darwin and Ursula Mommens, who married the painter and etcher Julian Trevelyan.

After Cambridge, Darwin became a court lawyer.  He covered golf for The Times from 1907 to 1953 and for Country Life from 1907 to 1961, the first writer ever to cover golf on a daily basis, instead of an occasional feature.  He was Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in 1934.

<doc id="2313854" title="Feast at Hong Gate" nonfiltered="1242" processed="1231" dbindex="451257">


The Feast at Hong Gate () was a historical event (206 BC or 205 BC -- it happened around the new year) later often memorialized in Chinese history, novels, and drama, including in Beijing opera.

The feast came about due to the jealousy and resentment of Xiang Yu (  /  ) towards Liu Bang (  /  ), who had conquered the heartland of Qin Dynasty and caused its destruction; Xiang had considered the destruction of Qin to be the prize reserved only for him.  Xiang was also angry that Liu, assuming that he would be made the Prince of Qin, appeared to be about to make the last ruler of Qin, Ying Ying, his prime minister in governing Qin.  Outnumbering Liu by about three-to-one and considering himself to be the superior general, and further instigated by his advisor Fan Zeng (  ), Xiang was set to attack Liu and annihilate Liu's army.

Xiang Yu's uncle Xiang Bo (  /  ), a general in his army, found out about this plan.  Being a good friend of Liu's strategist Zhang Liang (  ), he secretly rode to Liu's camp at night and told Zhang what was happening, trying to persuade Zhang to return to Xiang's camp with him and avoid the slaughter.  Zhang, arguing that he had an obligation to Liu, refused, and further arranged a meeting between Xiang Bo and Liu.  Liu flattered Xiang Bo and promised to be subservient to Xiang Yu and to pay respect to Xiang Yu the next morning, and Xiang Bo believed him.  Returning to Xiang Yu's camp, Xiang Bo persuaded Xiang Yu that it was inappropriate and ungrateful to destroy Liu and his army.  Instead, Xiang Yu began to set up a feast to entertain Liu the next day.

The next morning, Liu rode to Xiang Yu's camp with a small contingent of guards to pay respect to Xiang.  He apologized to Xiang for robbing him of his glory but at the same time extolling Xiang's valor in battle.  Xiang responded with sarcastic words but then started the feast.  During the feast, Xiang considered killing Liu, and Fan gave him multiple signals to do so, but Xiang could not make the decision to do so.  Fan then summoned Xiang's cousin Xiang Zhuang (  ), giving him instructions to do a sword dance as part of the entertainment and to stab Liu to death during the dance.  With Fan's instructions, Xiang Zhuang indeed offered to do a sword dance, and with Xiang Yu's approval, started dancing.  Xiang Bo, who had by this point been convinced that killing Liu was wrong, saw through the plan and started dancing as well and blocking Xiang Zhuang from being able to stab Liu.

When Zhang, who was also at the feast, saw what danger Liu was in, he went outside and summoned Liu's chief guard and brother-in-law Fan Ceng (  ), who advanced in full armor into the feast tent despite not having been invited, interrupting the sword dance.  While offended, Xiang was also impressed by Fan Ceng's bravado, and gave him an urn of wine and a pork shoulder -- which Fan proceeded to eat, using his shield as a plate.  Xiang was further impressed.  Fan then gave a lengthy speech about Liu's accomplishments and how it would be unjust for Xiang to kill him, but also implicitly confirming that Liu would not challenge Xiang's authority.  Xiang did not respond but invited Fan Ceng to join the table.  Fan Ceng sat next to Zhang, and they planned an escape.  Soon, when Liu was going to the latrine, Fan accompanied him, and they took a single horse (to avoid attention) for Liu to ride on to escape, with only Fan and several other guards -- Xiahou Ying (   ), Jin Jiang (  ), and Ji Xin (  ) accompanying him on foot.

Zhang Liang remained at the feast.  After a sufficient time period, in which he thought was enough for Liu to escape, he bowed to Xiang and apolologized on Liu's behalf for leaving, giving as the rationale that Liu had become drunk and unable to continue at the feast.  He offered, as gifts, a precious jade tablet for Xiang and a pair of jade measuring cups for Fan Zeng.  Xiang accepted his gift, but Fan, in disgust, threw the cups on the ground and cut them to pieces with his sword, predicting that now that Xiang had failed to kill Liu when he could, Liu would eventually lead to Xiang's downfall -- words that would turn out to be prophetic.

In Chinese idiomatic usage, "the Feast at Hong Gate" has often been used to refer to a trap or a situation ostensibly joyous but in fact treacherous.  Another idiom that relates to the event is "Xiang Zhuang's sword dance is aimed at the Duke of Pei" (Xiang Zhuang wujian, yi zai Pei Gong; "Duke of Pei" being a title that Liu had at the time), meaning that a person's acts were intended to be a veiled attack on another person.

Arthur Bayley was a gold prospector who discovered gold at Fly Flat, Australia on 17 September 1892, around which the town of Coolgardie grew. 
He was born in 1865 and died in 1896, his father was John Bayeley, a butcher and wife to one Rosanna. 
Bayley discovered the gold with William Ford. Bayley hastily reported the discovery of 554 ounces of gold to J.M. Finnerty, the then resident mining warden at Southern Cross. At the time 554 ounces of gold was worth 2200 pounds - a great deal of money at the time - and in accordance with Western Australian mining regulations, Bayley was offered a "reward claim" covering 20 acres of land at Fly Flat. Bayley's reward claim proved to be a very profitable one indeed, and was continually worked until 1963. During the 70 years of its existence this mining claim recovered over 500,000 ounces gold.

Pietro Antonio Fiocco  (or Pier Antonio or Pierre-Antoine) (February 31654 - September 31714) was an Italian Baroque composer.

Pietro Antonio Fiocco was born in Venice.  Nothing is known of his childhood and his musical formation in Italy, but it is known that he soon made a name for himself, since the consul of Holland had him come to Amsterdam.  In 1681 the booklet of Helena rapita da Paride appeared, for which Fiocco composed some parts.  The same year he composed a prologue for Alceste by Jean-Baptiste Lully sung in Hanover.  In the summer of 1682, he went to Brussels to enter to the service of prince Eugène-Alexandre of Thurn and Taxis.  Named choirmaster of the church Notre-Dame des Victoires, Fiocco composed religious works, including masses and motets.  He died in Brussels in 1714. He was the proud father of Melissa Amelia Fiocco. She died at the young age of 23, leaving her husband, Angelo Pertioniro and 3 children, Sabrina Pertioniro, Gabriella Pertioniro and Claudio Pertioniro.

His son Joseph-Hector Fiocco (1703-1741) was also a composer and violinist of note.

<doc id="1981146" title="Southern Partisan" nonfiltered="1251" processed="1240" dbindex="451266">
Southern Partisan is a political magazine published in the United States founded in 1979 that focuses on its Southern region and those states that were formerly members of the Confederate States of America. Its first editor was Thomas Fleming. Since 1999 it has been edited by Christopher Sullivan.

The magazine generally espouses political paleoconservatism and a pro-southern perspective on political issues and the American Civil War. The magazine features commentary on southern culture, history, literature, the Southern Agrarians, the Civil War and Confederacy, and current political issues. It carries a news section entitled "CSA Today" covering stories from each of the 13 former Confederate states.

The magazine is harshly critical of political correctness and highlights news events involving what it describes as "politically correct" policy-making, such as the removal of Confederate historical monuments. It also gives out a "Scalawag Award" in each issue to politicians who support politically correct actions.

Book reviews of current texts pertaining to all aspects of the southern United States appear in each issue, as do general political opinion pieces from conservative and libertarian perspectives. The magazine carries columns by syndicated opinion commentators including Walter Williams, William Murchison, Joseph Sobran, and Charley Reese. It is currently published on a bimonthly basis.

Although the magazine is frequently found in the historical racks in mainstream bookstores, it would be more fitting to find it in the current events section. Its emphasis is also cultural and political. Its statement of purpose, stated at the top of its masthead in every issue, is taken from a letter written by Donald Davidson (poet) to Allen Tate in May 1927: "If there were a Southern magazine, intelligently conducted and aimed specifically, under the doctrine of provincialism, at renewing a certain sort of sectional consciousness and drawing separate groups of Southern thought together, something might be done to save the South."

Critics and commentary.
Due to its conservative political leaning and advocacy of the southern side in the American Civil War, Southern Partisan has been the subject of controversy. The New York Times described Southern Partisan as "one of the (southern) region's most right-wing magazines," notes its disapproval of Abraham Lincoln and the Union during the Civil War, and tendency to "venerate the rebel soldiers who fought to secede from the United States." According to the Times, it is also socially conservative as evidenced by a 1999 editorial denouncing the Miami Herald's coverage of gay issues. Though critical of these beliefs, the Times nevertheless notes that "Many of (Southern Partisan's) articles, however, are more high-minded historical reviews in the tradition of the Southern agrarian movement, which glorified the South's slow-paced traditions of farms and small towns." (New York Times, 2/8/2000)

Several sources on the political left have openly accused the magazine of racism. Ed Sebesta, an anti-neo-confederate fringe partisan based in Dallas, Texas commonly attacks the magazine, asserting that Southern Partisan, along with Chronicles (magazine), are the " major publications" of the Neo-Confederate movement. Slate online magazine has described the Southern Partisan as a "crypto-racist, pro-Confederate magazine." In 2000, the president of People for the American Way called it "racist" and pointed to columns that criticize Martin Luther King, Jr and Nelson Mandela, and alleged that it views slavery favorably.  The Times report quotes a passage about the "myth that vicious white slave traders dragged Africans from their idyllic homeland to serve as chattel for arrogant white Americans."  They also note that the same article describes white slave traders as being better to the blacks than the African warlords. The Times notes that "(t)he magazine rarely writes about slavery," preferring to focus on more genteel aspects of the past. According to the Times article, Southern Partisan "takes the position that the Civil War was fought not over slavery, but over the preservation of a Southern way of life that to this day is worth preserving." (2/8/2000)

The magazine rejects many of its critics' characterizations, arguing that they derive primarily from the far left wing of the political spectrum and from advocates of political correctness. Responding to critics the magazine's Christopher Sullivan charged them with taking "quotes out of context to paint a picture of racial and historical bigotry in the Partisan." (The Never Ending Struggle by Christopher Sullivan, Southern Partisan 1999 4th Quarter) As a prime example, Sullivan pointed to excerpted quotations that critics purported to speak favorably about slavery but were in fact a synopsis of statistical data from Time on the Cross, a scholarly study on slavery authored by socialist cliometrists Stanley Engerman and Nobel prize recipient Robert Fogel. Sullivan contended that other quotations had been similarly misconstrued by critics on the left and rejected their attacks as the product of a politically correct and politically motivated "feeding frenzy."

Responding to the allegations of racism, the magazine's editors are quick to point out that they regularly publish articles by African American writers such as Williams. Sullivan dismisses these allegations as ad hominem attacks and predicts they will continue from sources in the media and on the political left as long as the magazine is published. "Will it end? As King Lear put it, 'Never, never, never, never, never.' And that's why our resistance to the assaults must also never end."

John Ashcroft nomination.
Southern Partisan received national attention in 2001 during the confirmation hearings of U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. Democrats in the U.S. Senate criticized Ashcroft over a 1998 interview he gave with the magazine in which he praised Robert E. Lee. It was alleged that Ashcroft's statements exhibited racial insensitivity since Lee was a former general for the Confederacy. The magazine responded that Ashcroft's critics were engaging in political correctness and playing the "race card" for political reasons. When pressed by Democratic Senators Joseph Biden and Ted Kennedy about the interview during his confirmation hearings, Ashcroft replied "I would rather be falsely accused of racism than to falsely accuse others."

<doc id="2758028" title="Menelaus (general)" nonfiltered="1252" processed="1241" dbindex="451267">
Menelaus (in Greek M     o ; lived 4th century BC) was son of Lagus and brother of Ptolemy I Soter, king of Egypt. His name does not occur among the officers or generals of Alexander the Great (336 323 BC) during the lifetime of that monarch, though it is incidentally mentioned by Phylarchus in terms that would seem to imply that he then already occupied a distinguished position. The first occasion, on which he appears in history is 315 BC, when he was appointed by his brother to the chief command of the forces dispatched to Cyprus, where they were destined to co-operate with the fleet of Seleucus, and with Nicocreon, king of Salamis. By their combined efforts, they soon reduced all the cities of Cyprus to subjection, with the exception of Citium; and that also, it would appear, must have ultimately submitted. Menelaus now remained in the island, which he governed with almost absolute authority, the petty princes of the several cities being deposed, imprisoned, or assassinated on the slightest symptom of disaffection. He still held the chief command in 306 BC, when Demetrius Poliorcetes arrived in Cyprus with a powerful fleet and army. Unable to contend with this formidable antagonist in the open field, Menelaus drew together all his forces, and shut himself up within the walls of Salamis, which he prepared to defend to the utmost. But having risked an action under the walls of the town, he was defeated with much loss; and Demetrius pressed the siege with his wonted vigour. Menelaus, however, succeeded in burning his battering engines; and by the most strenuous exertions, made good his defence until the arrival of Ptolemy himself, with a powerful fleet, to the relief of the island. In the great sea-fight that ensued, Menelaus sent a squadron of sixty ships to assist Ptolemy; but though these succeeded in forcing their way out of the harbour of Salamis, they came too late to retrieve the fortune of the day; and the total defeat of the Egyptian fleet having extinguished all his hopes of succour, he immediately afterwards surrendered the city of Salamis, with all his forces, both military and naval, into the hands of Demetrius. The conqueror, with characteristic magnanimity, sent him back to Egypt, accompanied by his friends, and carrying with him all his private property. From this time we hear no more of Menelaus. There are some coins, attributed to him, which must have been struck during the period of his occupation of Cyprus.

Robin F. Neill (1931   ) is a Canadian economic historian teaching at the University of Prince Edward Island. Prior to his present appointment, he was a longstanding professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.

Over the past 40 years, Neill has written three books and over forty academic articles. His writings in the Journal of Canadian Studies have been extensive   with subjects including Adam Shortt, Harold Adams Innis, Social Credit, economic activity in Quebec, the state of economic history in the 1970s, and the Saskatchewan school of economic historiography.  His work offers a right-wing analysis of Canadian economic history.  

He established himself as a critic of H.A. Innis  staple thesis, which explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east-west conception of trade. Neill advocates a post-Innisian thesis, explaining the development as an expression of variegated regions (population density, cultural politics, geographic characteristics) and of their particular north-south relations with the United States.

Rugby league has been played in France since the 1930s. As with rugby union, the heartland of the game is the south of the country.

History.
Rugby football was introduced into France by the British in the early 1870s. It quickly began to flourish in the poorer, more rural south. The French Rugby clubs remained in affiliation with the southern British Rugby Union and IRB when Rugby split in 1895. By the 1930s the rugby union authorities concluded that France rugby union was breaching amateur regulations, and they were suspended from playing against the other nations. Looking round for an alternative, many French players turned to rugby league, which soon became a popular game in France, particularly in the south west of the country. 

- 6th of April 1934: the French rugby league was born with the constitution of the Ligue Française de Rugby à XIII (i.e. the French RL Federation).
- 12th of January 1938: Recognition of the Ligue Française de Rugby à XIII (i.e. the French RL Federation) by the French government of Prime Minister C. Chautemps (it is the Prime minister who took the decision, the Ministry for Sports was not in favour of such a decision; 2 days after, for other reasons, resignation of the government)
.. Note: the FRL's governmental Recognition remained valid till Oct. 1940 and returned in full force as from Sept. 1944 till the present time (even if the name changed during 42 years 2 months 2 days). 
(Rugby league became associated with socialist politics in France whereas rugby union remained the game of the establishment.)

The defeat of France in the Second World War had serious implications for rugby league. 
. 15 October 1940: the French RL federation instructed its clubs to play RU games (as from 22 Oct. 1940), it is the beginning of the ban (excepted for under 18 years old players authorised to play RL 1 year more).
. 29th of December 1941: by a decree of the Vichy regime rugby league was banned on demand of Berlin and numerous players, clubs and officials entered in Union. (Note: between end of 1940 and mid of 1942, at least 6 other French amateur sport federations were also banned and destroyed by the Vichy regime). A BBC reporter explained it thus: " This year (2002) a French government inquiry found that "influential officials in the French Rugby Federation endeavoured to eliminate the competitor, which they claimed was a deviant form of rugby union."" 
"They just came to the club. I was there training in the Under 13's. They told us we had to stop playing Rugby 13. They took our kit, and even the balls" - 1942, Unknown

- End of September 1944: reinstallation of the French rugby league and of the Ligue Française de Rugby à XIII (i.e. the French RL Federation) in the French sport community.

The consequences of the vichy regime ban reverberate to this day; seized assets were never returned but: the French Republic by giving (since numerous years) to the French Rugby League the "Sport de Haut Niveau" statute (FRL doesn't comply with all laws and regulations for this statute (1)) compensates for the losses by important annual subsidies, and although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from using the word rugby in its title until 1991, having to use the name Jeu à Treize (Game of Thirteen, in reference to the number of player in a rugby league side) from 24th of April 1949 to 26th of June 1991 (in compliance with the Official Documents of the French Republic i.e. during 42 years, 2 months and 2 days).

After the war the French game was re-established and the French became one rugby league s major powers. The first Rugby League World Cup was held in France in 1954 in order to raise funds. France played major international series against Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The 1951 and 1955 French tours of Australia are still regarded as two of the strongest sides ever to tour Australia.

However the game has since declined in France. Over the years many players have defected to play rugby union, which has overshadowed league since the war. Indeed in 2005, during a scheduled game between France and Australia, the local rugby union forced the rescheduling of the match to a less opportunistic period for it.

Governing body.
The governing body for rugby league in France is, since the 26th of June 1991, the Fédération Francaise de Rugby à Treize (i.e. formerly Ligue Française de Rugby à XIII then, Fédération Française de Jeu à XIII).
The Federation is a founding member of and a full member of the Rugby League International Federation (i.e. IRLB Jan. 1948) and of the Rugby League European Federation (i.e. May 2003).

Competitions.
The French rugby league championship  has been the major rugby league tournament for semi-professional clubs in France since the sport was introduced to the country in the thirties. The championship is divided into several divisions; the top league is currently titled Elite Championship. The premier knock-out cup is the Lord Derby Cup.

In the early Super League (Europe) -Feb. 1996- a new team, Paris Saint Germain took part, the players being drawn from the French league. It failed -Oct. 1997- partly because Paris was not in the southern heartland of French rugby league and partly because the players had the double burden of playing for both Paris and their original club.

However the links between French and English rugby league did not die with the demise of the Paris club. Each year four French teams take part in the Challenge Cup, and the French club based in Perpignan, formerly known as UTC (Union Treiziste Catalan), now known as Les Catalans play, since Feb. 2006, in Super League. Other French clubs such as Toulouse may perhaps follow.

Popularity.
In 2002, it was estimated that around rugby league had around 10,000 regular players in France, compared with around 215,000 for rugby union. The game struggles for attention in the national media, but is covered by local outlets in the south. However the introduction of Catalans Dragons in to Super League has seen substantial articles appearing in national newspapers such as L'Équipe, Libération and Le Figaro during 2006. It is assumed that the game will reach its previous levels of popularity and make inroads into rugby union's dominance.

The national team.


The French national rugby league team are often nicknamed les Chanteclairs, after the cockerel which is the emblem of the team, or as les Tricolores. They have competed in every World Cup and European Nations Cup, as well as playing in other tournaments such the Victory Cup.

It was announced that from 2009, France would enter into the current Tri-Nations setup involving Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain.  The introduction of the Les Catalans side in the British Super League, and recent strong outings from the international side led to this decision.  This should benefit the Rugby League world as a whole.

<doc id="8571814" title="Sason (spider)" nonfiltered="1264" processed="1252" dbindex="451279">


Sason is a genus of mygalomorph bark-dwelling trapdoor spiders of the family Barychelidae. It is distributed throughout the Australasian region. The closest related species seems to be the monotypic Paracenobiopelma gerecormophilum.

Description.
The small (five to ten millimeters long), compact, stout-legged spiders of the subfamily Sasoninae resemble those of the family Migidae in general appearance. Spiders of the genus Sason are strongly patterned. Especially the males have many short bristles on the glabrous carapace.

Distribution.
Most Sason species are endemic to rather small areas. Two factors are believed to have contributed to the distribution pattern of Sason. For one, some are found on small islands that emerged from the ocean floor in recent geological times, without ever having been connected to the mainland. These were likely inhabited by pregnant females surviving in floating logs. However, most of the speciation is believed to have occured due to fragmentation of the former supercontinent Gondwana.

Name.
The genus name, an abbreviation of the biblical name Samson, and an earlier name for the genus, Sarpedon (a legendary king at the siege of Troy), both allude to the regal appearence of these spiders. Sason was a replacement name for Sarpedon when Simon found out that Sarpedon was already preoccupied for a genus of beetles.

Species.
 Sason andamanicum Simon, 1888 (Andaman Is.);
 Sason colemani Raven, 1986 (Queensland);
 Sason hirsutum Schwendinger, 2003 (Indonesia);
 Sason maculatum (Roewer, 1963) (Mariana Is., Caroline Is.);

The Shire of Busselton is a Local Government Area of Western Australia.  It is located in the state's South West region, approximately 220km south of Perth. The shire covers an area of 1455 km² and has a population of about 22,000. It contains two large towns, Busselton and Dunsborough, and a number of smaller towns. The shire office is located on Southern Drive, Busselton.

History.
The Shire of Busselton began in 1871 as two entities - the Busselton Municipal District, governing the town of Busselton, and the Sussex Road District, governing the rural area. The two merged in 1951 to become the Busselton Road District. On 1 July 1961, the Road Board became the Busselton Shire Council.

The Shire of Busselton, together with neighbouring Capel, are among the state's fastest growing areas.

Wards.
The shire has been divided into 6 wards.
Central Rural Ward (1 Councillor);
Central Urban Ward (5 Councillors);
East Rural Ward (1 Councillor);
East Urban Ward (2 Councillors);

<doc id="1048718" title="Ford CHT engine" nonfiltered="1267" processed="1255" dbindex="451282">
The letters CHT denote a particular type of 4-cylinder internal combustion engine produced by the Ford Motor Company in Brazil during the 1980s. It is a completely different engine from the CVH engine and should not be mistaken with it.

The CHT (Compound High Turbulence) engine was introduced by Ford in 1984 in the Mark 3 version of the Ford Escort, the first of the series to be released in Brazil. It was later used in the Ford Del Rey, the Ford Verona (a Brazilian Ford Orion), as well as the Volkswagen Gol.

The engine itself is an evolution of the very efficient Renault Ventoux engine, which Ford inherited upon buying the Brazilian Willys/Renault plant in the late 1960s. It has 8 overhead valves OHV, of the rotating valve design.

It was very robust and economic with modest performance compared to the competing Volkswagen AP engine.

It was unusual in being available in an alcohol-fuelled version, which generated at least 10% more power than the petrol model, with about 25% increase on the fuel consumption. It had no problems at all for cold starts and high fuel consumption unlike the cars of major competitor General Motors had at that time.

Three models were available:
 1.6 petrol (65 hp);
 1.6 alcohol (74 hp);
 1.6 XR alcohol (83hp) for the Escort XR3;

In 1987, with the release of the Mark 4 Ford Escort, this engine benefited from some revisions, resulting in the CHT E-Max (maximised economy) version. All the new models featured better torque.

In 1992, a smaller version was released for the Escort and the Gol:
 1.0 petrol (50 hp);

During the Autolatina period (1990-1996) VW used this engine, naming it AE-1600 and AE-1000, but it is basically the same engine. AE = Alta Economia (High Economy).

In 1996 and 1997 the CHT was gradually replaced by the Volkswagen AP and the new Volkswagen AT, in the VW cars, or the newer Zetec 16-valve unit and the inferior Endura-E engine, in the Ford cars.

Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (Pashto/Arabic:                   ) (b. at Hashtnagar in Utmanzai, Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province, India, c. 1890; d. in Peshawar, NWFP, Pakistan, 20 January 1988) was a Pashtun (Afghan) political and spiritual leader known for his non-violent opposition to British Rule during the final years of the Imperial rule in  the Indian sub-continent. He was a lifelong pacifist and a devout Muslim. He was known as Badshah Khan (sometimes written as Bacha Khan), the King of Chiefs, and Frontier Gandhi.

 Early years .
Ghaffar Khan was born into a generally peaceful and prosperous family in the Peshawar Valley. His father, Behram Khan, was a land owner, farmer, and the chief of the Mohammedzais ("sons of Mohamed") tribe of the Pashtun (Pathan) people.

Ghaffar was the second son of Behram to attend the British run Edward's mission school -- an unusual arrangement since it was discouraged by the local mullahs. At school the young Ghaffar did well in his studies and was inspired by his mentor Reverend Wigram to see the importance of education in service to the community. In his 10th and final year of high school he was offered a highly prestigious commission in The Guides, an elite corp of Pashtun and Sikh soldiers of the British Raj. Ghaffar refused the commission after realizing even Guide officers were still second-class citizens in their own country. He resumed his intention of University study and Reverend Wigram offered him the opportunity to follow his brother, Khan Sahib, to study in London. While he eventually received the permission of his father, Ghaffar's mother wasn't willing to lose another son to London -- and their own culture and religion as the mullahs warned her. So Ghaffar began working on his father's lands while attempting to discern what more he might do with his life.

 Badshah Khan .

In response to his inability to continue his own education, Ghaffar Khan turned to helping others start theirs. Like many such regions of the world, the strategic importance of the newly formed North West Frontier Province (NWFP) as a buffer for the British Raj from Russian influence was of little benefit to its residents. The oppression of the British, the repression of the mullahs, and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted Ghaffar to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education. At 20 years of age, Ghaffar opened his first school in Utmanzai. It was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers.

While he faced much opposition and personal difficulties, including the loss of his first wife in 1915 to an influenza epidemic, Ghaffar Khan worked tirelessly to organize and raise the consciousness of his fellow Pushtuns. Between 1915 and 1918 he visited every one of the 500 settled districts of the Frontier. It was in this frenzied activity that he had come to be known as the Badshah Khan (King of Chiefs).

 Khudai Khidmatgar .

In time, Ghaffar Khan's goal came to be the formulation of a united, independent, secular India. To achieve this end, he founded the Khudai Khidmatgar ("Servants of God"), commonly known as the "Red Shirts" (Surkh Posh), during the 1920s. 

The Khudai Khidmatgar was founded on a belief in the power of Gandhi's notion of Satyagraha, a form of active non-violence as captured in an oath. He told its members: I am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army will not be able to stand against it. It is the weapon of the Prophet, but you are not aware of it. That weapon is patience and righteousness. No power on earth can stand against it.

The organization recruited over 100,000 members and became legendary in opposing (and dying at the hands of) the British-controlled police and army.  Through strikes, political organisation and non-violent opposition, the Khudai Khidmatgar were able to achieve some success and came to dominate the politics of the NWFP. His brother, Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (known as Dr. Khan Sahib), led the political wing of the movement, and was the Chief Minister of the province (from the late 1920s until 1947 when his government was dismissed by Mohammad Ali Jinnah of the Muslim League).

 Gandhi and the National Congress Party .
 
Ghaffar Khan forged a close, spiritual, and uninhibited friendship with Mahatma Gandhi, the pioneer of non-violent mass civil disobedience in India. The two had a deep admiration towards each other and worked together closely till 1947.

The Khudai Khidmatgar agitated and worked cohesively with the Indian National Congress, the leading national organization fighting for freedom, of which Ghaffar Khan was a senior and respected member. On several occasions when the Congress seemed to disagree with Gandhi on policy, Ghaffar Khan remained his staunchest ally. In 1931 the Congress offered him the presidency of the party, but he refused saying, "I am a simple soldier and Khudai Khidmatgar, and I only want to serve." But he remained a member of the Congress Working Committee for a long time, resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the Party's War Policy. He rejoined the Congress Party when the War Policy was revised.

Ghaffar Khan was a champion of women's rights and nonviolence. He became a hero in a society dominated by violence; notwithstanding his liberal views, his unswerving faith and obvious bravery led to immense respect. Throughout his life, he never lost faith in his non-violent methods or in the compatibility of Islam and nonviolence. He viewed his struggle as a jihad with only the enemy holding swords. He was closely identified with Gandhi and he is known in India as the `Frontier Gandhi'.

"O Pathans! Your house has fallen into ruin. Arise and rebuild it, and remember to what race you belong." -- Ghaffar Khan

 The Partition .

Ghaffar Khan strongly opposed the partition of India. While the Red Shirts were willing to work with Indian politicians, some Pashtuns desired independence from both India and the newly created state of Pakistan following the departure of the British. Targeted with being Anti-Muslim Ghaffar was attacked by fellow Muslims in 1946, leading to his hospitalisation in Peshawar.

The Congress party refused last ditch compromises to prevent the partion, like the Cabinet mission plan and Gandhi's suggestion to offer the Prime Ministership to Jinnah. As a result Bacha Khan and his followers felt a sense of betrayal by both Pakistan and India. Bacha Khan's last words to Gandhi and his erstwhile allies in the Congress party were: "You have thrown us to the wolves."

When given a choice between Pakistan and India, most voters chose Pakistan by a margin of 9 to 1 in 1947. A loya jirga in the Tribal Areas garnered a similar result as most preferred to become part of Pakistan.  Khan asked his supporters to boycott the polls only 7% came to vote while the rest 93% of NWFP population boycotted the elections. 

In February 1948, Khan took the oath of allegiance to the new nation of Pakistan. Shortly afterwards he addressed the Pakistan constituent assembly and announced his support for Pakistan, while at the same time his Khudai Khidmatgar movement pledged allegiance to Pakistan and severed all links to the Congress Party.



In his speech to the assembly he said: "Whenever I had an opportunity to address the people in different parts of our province, I told them clearly that indeed, I was of the opinion that India should not be divided because today in India we have witnessed the result. Thousands and thousands of young and old, children, men, and women were massacred and ruined. But now that the division is an accomplished fact, the dispute is over.
"I delivered many speeches against the division of India, but the question is: has anybody listened to me? You may hold any opinion about me, but I am not a man of destruction but of construction. If you study my life, you will find that I devoted it to the welfare of our country. We have proclaimed that if the Government of Pakistan would work for our people and our country the Khudai Khidmatgars would be with them. I repeat that I am not for the destruction of Pakistan. In destruction lies no good.
"Neither Hindus nor Muslims, nor the Frontier, not Punjab, Bengal or Sindh stands to gain from it. There is advantage only in construction. I want to tell you categorically I will not support anybody in destruction. If any constructive programme is before you, if you want to do something constructive for our people, not in theory, but in practice, I declare before this House that I and my people are at your service..." (Puri, pp 188-190).

 Arrest and Exile .

Under the new Pakistani government, Ghaffar Khan was under house arrest without charge from 1948 till 1954. Released from prison he gave a speech again on the floor of the constituent assembly, this time condemning the massacre of his supporters at Babra Sharif.

"I had to go to prison many a time in the days of the Britishers. Although we were at loggerheads with them, yet their treatment was to some extent tolerant and polite. But the treatment which was meted out to me in this Islamic state of ours was such that I would not even like to mention it to you." Badshah Khan, Budget session of Assembly on March 20th, 1954."

He went on to say:
"Six years ago, I announced on the floor of this House that Pakistan is our country and its solidarity and protection is our duty and that any program that will be submitted by any party for its progress and its reconstruction shall have my fullest cooperation. I repeat those words of mind even today. But still there are some persons who suspect my loyalty. I therefore think that it would be advisable to set up a tribunal to enquire not only into the question of loyalty or treason but also into the general massacre, arson and loot and the dishonouring of women and children and old men at Charsadda and the oppressive treatment meted out to us in jail."  Badshah Khan, Budget session of Assembly on March 20, 1954. 

Despite his vitriol he confounded his opponents and Indian supporters, who had long agitated for Ghaffar Khan's release, when to cheering crowds he supported Pakistan's claim to the disputed territory of Kashmir and went on to claim that he had twice offered his services in Kashmir on Pakistan's behalf.

Re-arrested in 1956 or his opposition to the One-Unit scheme he remained in prison till 1959. Upon being released he went into exile in Kabul. In 1969, he was invited to India to attend the 100th birthday of Gandhi, his first visit after independence. 

In 1962, Abdul Ghaffar Khan was named an "Amnesty International Prisoner of the Year." Amnesty's statement about him said, "His example symbolizes the suffering of upward of a million people all over the world who are in prison for their conscience." 

His autobiography My life and struggle: Autobiography of Badshah Khan was published in 1969.

He visited India and participated in the centenary celebrations of the Indian National Congress in 1985; he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 1987.

Ghaffar Khan died in Peshawar under house arrest in 1988 and was buried in Jalalabad according to his wishes. Although he had been repeatedly imprisoned and persecuted, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, marching through the historic Khyber Pass from Peshawar to Jalalabad. A cease fire was announced in the Afghan Civil War to allow the funeral to take place, even though it was marred by bomb explosions kllling 15.

"Better be poisoned in one's own blood then to be poisoned in one's principle."

His eldest son Ghani Khan was a poet. Another son Khan Wali Khan is the founder and leader of the Awami National Party and was the Leader of the Opposition in the Pakistan National Assembly. His third son Ali Khan was non-political and a distinguished educator, and served as Vice-Chancellor of University of Peshawar. Ali Khan was also the head of Aitchison College, Lahore, and Fazle Haq college, Mardan.

Alien Breed 2004 (sometimes AB2K4 or AB2004) is an unfinished and shelved game in Team17's Alien Breed franchise, a series of Science Fiction-themed shooters largely inspired by the Alien films. It was announced as in development in 2003, and was shelved in early 2005.

This is the second known title in the Alien Breed series to be cancelled, after the aborted PC first-person shooter title Alien Breed: Conflict.

 Information .
The game was reportedly being developed using the Snowblind Engine that Snowblind Studios had been using for the Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath franchises. Early screenshots released on the CVG website (and later seen on Dream17's page for AB2004) showed that the game was returning to its roots with a semi-top-down perspective rather than the first-person perspective seen in the previous two games, AB3D & TKG.

Despite enthusiastic discussion on Team17's official Forum from both fans of the series and Team17 Staff, a lack of publisher interest resulted in the shelving. Martyn Brown, creative director at Team17, has stated that there is a new Alien Breed project in the works.

 Speculation .
Given that the game had taken a step away from the first-person genre, some people view this game as an attempted remake of the original Alien Breed. This is also implied by the title, although titles such as x 2004' are usually placeholder titles until a final title is decided upon, and are more often indicative of the intended year of release.

Please also keep in mind that the Play Mode, Media and Input information in the Infobox above is also speculative. A Multiplayer mode is assumed to have been in development as screenshots show two players in a spaceship-like environment, as well as the fact that all previous Alien Breed games have had Multiplayer modes. The DVD-ROM mediatype and DualShock 2 controller information is also speculative based on the specifications for the PlayStation 2, however it is unlikely that the game would have come on another format, or that it would have used a different, game-specific controller.

<doc id="8719210" title="Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan" nonfiltered="1276" processed="1264" dbindex="451291">
General Mohammed Said (or Siad) Hersi Morgan was the son-in-law of Siad Barre and minister of defense of Somalia, responsible for the 1988 bombing of Hargeisa and Burao, two cities in Somaliland. Thousands of civilians were killed in these bombardments. Said Hersi Morgan is thought to be responsible for many other atrocities committed against the Somali population during the Barre government and during the civil war of the 90's in the region of Kismayu. His military campaign in Southern Somalia in 1992 was one of the main causes of the famine in Somalia in that same year. As a consequence 300.000 Somali may have died.He is also accused of drug-dealing. and controlling the supply routes of khat.;

Career.
Siad Barre Government.
Mohammed Said Hersi (Majeerteen from the sub-clan Abdirahim) received his military training in both Italy and the USA. As a colonel he was commander of the Mogadishu sector, where the elite units of the Armed Forces were stationed (ca. 1980).
He then went on to become commander of the Red Barets, responsible for the suppression of the revolt of The Majerteen united in the SSDF in 1982. From 1986 to 1988, as a general, he was the military commander of the 26th military district (the region of Somaliland) and in September 1990 he was appointed as minister of defense and substitute head of state.

In 1988 operations conducted by the Barre government against Somali National Movement (SNM) rebels in the northern part of the country led to the death and imprisonment of thousands of Somali civilians by the Somali National Army.

 Hersi Morgan was in charge of these operations, and thus became known as the "Butcher of Hargeisa."

Somali Civil War.


After the fall of the government on 26 January 1992 Mohammed Said Hersi together with Siad Barre fled from Mogadishu to the South-West of the the country. In Gedo he regrouped the army. Together with Barre s son General Maslah, Mohammed Said Hersi  went abroad through Kenya on an arms purchasing mission. According to a report of the Minority Rights Group based in Britain  they purchased $27 Million worth of arms and petroleum at various black markets. Mohammed Said Hersi became the chairman of the newly founded Somali National Front (SNF); the remains of the Somali National Army functioned as its militia. The SNF made two efforts (one in April 1991 and the other in April 1992) to recapture the capital Mogadishu. Both efforts failed. The SNF was vanquished by the USC and pushed back to the Kenyan border. It later survived in a diminished form in and around Kismayo. Mohammed Said Hersi then tried to unite the Marehan with the other Darod  (Ogaden and Majeerteen ) to conquer the region around Kismayo. Siad Barre fled from Somalia to Kenya in April 1992.
On January 8, 1993 Mohammed Said Hersi was one of the signatories of agreement reached at the UN-sponsored Informal Preparatory Meeting on National Reconciliation, and the March 1993 Conference on National Reconciliation in Somalia, both in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. However, fighting continued in the country unabated.

In December 1993, Mohammed Said Hersi's troops captured Kismayo, and awaited the departure of Belgian UN peacekeepers who were stationed there. His troops had taken advantage of the UN's preoccupation with Mohamed Farah Aidid and had rearmed and regrouped. Mohammed Said Hersi remained in control of Kismayo until 1999. In that period Hersi Morgan cooperated with his former enemies, the Majerteen of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF).Operating from Kismayo Mohammed Said Hersi was also active in the Kenyan border area . His militia rarely fought  those  Siyad Hussein, Col. Omar Jess, Ahmed Hashi which also operated in this region. Instead, they devoted most of their energies to preying upon IDPs and refugees. The area around Dobley refugee camp earned a reputation as one of the most dangerous and violent places in the entire region; women gathering firewood in the bush were routinely raped by predatory militiamen, aid convoys were looted, and refugees subjected to extortion and shakedowns.

After the SNF had split up between Marehan and other factions Hersi had lost his position as leader in that faction. He then joined the Somali Patriot Movement (SPM), which consisted of Darod tribe militias, the Rahanweyn Resistance Army, and the South Somali National Movement (SSNM). 
Hersi Morgan was head of the self created entity Jubaland between September 3 1998 June 11, 1999.  However he lost the territory to the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA) under Ahmed Warsame in 1999 and only briefly recaptured Kismayo on 6-7 Aug 2001. The town remained in the hands of the Juba Valley Alliance until 2006.

Transitional National Government.
Hersi Morgan was present at the conclusion of the peace Talks in Kenya  (2002-2004) in which a transitional Somali Transitional National Government (later to become the Transitional Federal Government) was formed. This conclusion, however, was put to risk in September 2004 by the withdrawal of Said Hersi Morgan, who prepared his forces to attack Kismayu, controlled by the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA) which had ousted him in 1999.

Ambassador Kiplagat requested IGAD to impose sanctions against Hersi Morgan for withdrawing from the peace process. The JVA and other warlords began to mobilize forces to oppose him. In September there was some fighting at a distance from Kismayu and the local population fled, but within some days the conference facilitators had persuaded Hersi Morgan to return to Nairobi and re-join the reconciliation conference, although he was not selected as a member of parliament. According to Amnesty International "his presence at the peace talks, more than any of the other warlords, had highlighted the significance of the issue of impunity and its effect on human rights in the future."

In May 2005 Said Hersi Morgan left Nairobi to pay a short visit with his militia in Mogadishu and talked to representatives of the USC. The battle between the militia and the ICU for the control of the capital would start February 2006 (see Second Battle of Mogadishu). Members of this same USC have been the victim of atrocities of troops of Said Hersi Morgan in 1992. In that year  the SNF retook with assistance of the Kenyan military (in violation of a United Nations Security Council arms embargo), the Gedo region. In October 1992, the SNF captured the town of Bardera, committing atrocities against civilians who were thought to have supported the USC (solely on the basis of hteir clan identity) and greatly disrupting relief efforts.

In 1991, when Said Hersi was minister of defense in the Barre government, there still were 54,000 soldiers under his command. Fourteen years later only 1,000 of those remain.

Morgan's militia is currently based in Gode, in southern Ogaden,  Ethiopia. The family of Mohammed Hersi Morgan lives in the United States.

Accusations of war crimes.
Mohammed Said Hersi "Morgan" is held to be a war criminal by many in Somalia and abroad. A member of the British Parliament, Andrew Robathan, stated that "it is generally accepted that General Morgan, who was in Siad Barre's Government at the time, was responsible for the shooting of a large part of the male population Hargeysa."
(4 Feb 2004) An independent paper written for the UNHCR by Professor Kenneth Menkhaus in August 2003 stated, "General Morgan is a political pariah, likely to be the first Somali leader charged with war crimes at some point in the future." However, as yet no charges have been leveled against General "Morgan" by any international criminal court.

Eastern Creek is a suburb in the City of Blacktown, in Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is adjacent to Erskine Park and Rooty Hill.

It is most notable for containing the former Wonderland Sydney amusement park, and the Eastern Creek Raceway, which adjoins the Prospect Reservoir.

The suburb's name origin lies in the fact the eastern branch of South Creek became to known as "Eastern Creek". The village that then grew where the road crossed the creek became known as Eastern Creek.

Given the industrial nature of the area, this suburb is managed as a part of the Eastern Creek Area, along with Arndell Park and Huntingwood. With this in mind most statistics and demographic information is not available for this suburb by itself.

After practice is broken up, Slater chases after Jenny, played by Ami Dolenz whom was doing sprint training next to the football field. Slater engages her in a playful conversation, trying his best to convince her to let him take her to the homecoming dance. Jenny teases Slater by not giving him an answer, before too long Slater has to run, as McGuinness and his friends see him and start to run towards him. As McGuinness and his team mates chase Slater, Slater takes refuge on a school bus, where he successfully hides from them. However, the school bus then gets filled with students, including McGuinness and Jenny which forces Slater to pose a potential physics student. The terrorists have entered the city's water and power plant, where they gather up all the staff as hostages.

The bus is on route to the same water and power plant, as a field excursion. When confronted by the Professor, the surprised guard, who is a terrorist is forced to give them entry into the plant so no suspicions would arise. Whilst passing through the gate, Slater spots an AK-47 in the guard's office, and what he believes was a dead body behind some trash cans. When he confronts the professor with his claims, she reminds him of his reputation as a practical joker and orders him to remain behind in the bus.

As the other students file off the bus, Slater is left by himself. He notes a couple of men who sport machine guns, and watches them, as they perform some type of liquid extraction in their van. Inside the plant, McGuinness stops Jenny and asks her to be his date as opposed to Slater; Jenny also turns him down, the pair then notices they have been left behind. The rest of the students and the professor are order to the hostage area. One of the terrorists, the American traitor, calls a military officer with their demands, it turns out the traitor was once a solider under the man he is calling, who left him behind in battle in the Persian Gulf in 1991. The terrorists demand that a prisoner is released or they will contaminate the city's water supply with the 'VX solution'.

Slater enters the plant and finds both Jenny and McGuinness, Slater attempts to explain that the plant is being held by terrorists, McGuinness however does not believe a word of it and asks one of the guards for assistance who shoots at them. Slater and Jenny get away but McGuinness is taken hostage. Slater and Jenny are forced to evade numerous attacks on them, as they run and hide in various locations around the plant, meanwhile the military start to gather around the perimeter. The pair shouts out to the military but instead get shot at by a terrorist, which starts a shooting frenzy between the military and the terrorists.

After a short period of time, the prisoner arrives, so the demands will be met. However, in the exchange of the prisoner, the American terrorist and his old military commander exchange words which sees the military agent being shot, which results in panic and more gunfire where the valuable prisoner is killed by an FBI agent.

In the plant, the hunt continues for the two missing hostages, Slater and Jenny, who take it upon themselves to try and foil the attack on the water supply. Jenny creates a diversion, as Slater is able to grab the terrorists, as Jenny uses her speed to get to the small bomb in time and throw it off the water supply entry. Slater then grabs the VX solution, which he saw being extracted earlier when he was left on the bus. Slater and Jenny rejoin the hostages as McGuinness also helps, as they overthrow the few remaining terrorists. The party survives, despite McGuinness getting injured from a shot in the shoulder. The film ends with Slater and Jenny, Slater still trying to get a date.

Trivia.
 The film is the sequel to Demolition High;

10/18 is a French publishing house established in 1962 by Paul Chanterelle and Michel-Claude Jalard, which publishes only mass market paperbacks.  At the time of its inception "éditions 10/18" comprised philosophical works (Descartes, Nietzsche...), historical works, and some French fiction, in particular the genre of nouveau roman.

In 1968, Christian Bourgois took charge of 10/18, after the events of May of that year, which were followed by a véritable explosion in the social sciences. He proposed selling part of the catalogue and remaking the covers.  Between 1969 and 1979, 10/18 published 1000 titles, ranging from university texts to militant works, including reviews, conferences, and even mathematics texts along the way. 10/18 also republished the great literary classics, and the main nouveau roman works. Amongst the best-sellers of that time were : Boris Vian, Sade, London...

In the 1980s, Christian Bourgois decided to concentrate his efforts on foreign romantic fiction. And thus was born, under the direction of Jean-Claude Zylberstein, several new ranges of books:
 Domaine étranger in 1980, which was aimed at letting readers discover the best works of contemporary international fiction.
 Grands détectives in 1983, a collection of detective novels, by authors such as Ellis Peters, Lilian Jackson Braun or Robert van Gulik, Dashiell Hammett, William Irish  ;
 10/18 also published Bibliothèque médiévale in 1979 comprising the great classics of medieval literature (Lancelot, Le Morte d'Arthur, Le roman de Renart...).

In 1992, Christian Bourgois left 10/18, being succeeded by Leonello Brandolini and, since 1999, by Jean-Claude Dubost.

Penryn (Cornish: Pennrynn, from Pen-ryn meaning 'promontory') is a town in Cornwall, United Kingdom on the Penryn river.  Now the area is largely dominated by Falmouth, in the medieval period it was an important harbour in its own right, exporting granite and tin. There are 7,166 (2001 census) people living in Penryn. Penryn is twinned with Audierne in Brittany, France. The town has a station on the Maritime Line from Truro to Falmouth.


History.
Founded in 1216, Penryn is one of Cornwall's most ancient towns, with a wealth of charm, character and history. Standing at the head of the Penryn River, it occupies a sheltered position and was a port of some significance in the 15th century. 

By the 1600s, the port was thriving with the trade in Cornish tin and copper. From 1547, Penryn held a parliamentary constituency, which became Penryn and Falmouth in 1832. The consituency was abolished in 1950. It received a royal charter, as a borough in 1621.

In the early 19th century, granite works were established by the river and large quantities of the stone were shipped from its quays for construction projects both in the UK and abroad. Today, Penryn is a bustling town and has managed to retain an enormous amount of its heritage. With a large proportion of its buildings dating back to Tudor, Jacobean and Georgian times, the town has been designated as an important Conservation area. The local museum is housed in the Town Hall and brings the history to life.

penryn railway station]] was opened by the Cornwall Railway on 24 August 1863. It is towards the north west end of the town and is served by regular trains from Truro to Falmouth on the Maritime Line.

Education.

Higher Education.

Tremough

In 2004, the Tremough Campus was completed, creating the hub of the Combined Universities in Cornwall (CUC) project. It provides a new home for the Institute of Cornish Studies and the University of Exeter's world-renowned Camborne School of Mines, which has moved from Camborne, where it has been for over a century. The Campus also houses departments of University College Falmouth, which is based in the centre of Falmouth. Currently, the campus is undergoing work for its second phase, which includes increased student accommodation and new teaching areas.

The town was the site of a religious college, called Glasney College, before Henry VIII began disestablishing the Roman Catholic religion in the 1530s and 1540s.

For the Elvis Costello album, see Armed Forces.;

The armed forces of a state are its government sponsored defense and fighting forces and organizations. They exist to further the foreign and domestic policies of their governing body. In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces. Armed force is the use of armed forces to achieve political objectives.

The study of the use of Armed Forces is called military science.  Broadly speaking, this involves considering offense and defense at three "levels": strategy, operational art, and tactics. All of these areas study the application of the use of force in order to achieve a desired
objective.

Organization.
Britain invented the first armed forces in 1610. Armed forces may be organized as standing forces (e.g. regular army), which describes a professional army that is engaged in no other profession than preparing for and engaging in warfare.  In contrast, there is the citizen army.  A citizen army (also known as a militia or reserve army) is only mobilized as needed.  Its advantage lies in the fact that it is dramatically less expensive (in terms of wealth, manpower, and opportunity cost) for the organizing society to support.  The disadvantage is that such a "citizen's army" is less well trained and organized.    

A compromise between the two has a small cadre of professional NCOs (non-commissioned officers) and officers who act as a skeleton for a much larger force.  When war comes, this skeleton is filled out with conscripts or reservists (former full-time soldiers who volunteer for a small stipend to occasionally train with the cadre to keep their military skills intact), who form the wartime unit.  This balances the pros and cons of each basic organization, and allows the formation of huge armies (in terms of millions of combatants), necessary in modern large scale warfare.  

The armed forces in many larger countries are divided into three forces: an army, an air force, and usually a navy (unless geography dictates otherwise).  These forces may be solely for the purposes of training and support, or may be completely independent branches responsible for conducting operations independently of other services.  Most smaller countries have a single organization that encompasses all armed forces employed by the country in question.

Various countries have a variation on this standard model of three basic forces. Some, following the French model, use four forces, an army, a navy, an air force, and a gendarmerie, all with equal status. Other variations include South Africa (army, navy, air force, military health service), and Egypt (army, navy, air force, air defence.) The United States has five armed forces or services; the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Marine Corps, and the US Coast Guard. A unique version is Canada's Canadian Forces which is a unified force. (Army, Navy and Air Force combined together.)

In larger armed forces the culture between the different branches of a countries armed forces can be quite different. It has been said that "a navy and an air force man equipment" whereas "an army equips men".

The state of readiness of a military organisation may be indicated by its Alert state.

Benefits and costs.


The obvious benefit to a country in maintaining armed forces, is in providing protection from foreign threats, and from internal conflict. In recent decades armed forces personnel have also been used as emergency civil support roles in post-disaster situations. On the other hand they may also harm a society by engaging in counter-productive (or merely unsuccessful) warfare.

Expenditure on science and technology to develop weapons and systems sometimes produces side benefits, although some claim that greater benefits could come from targeting the money directly. 

Excessive expenditure on armed forces can drain a society of needed manpower and material, significantly reducing civilian living standards. If continued over a significant period of time,

<doc id="261635" title="Inline speed skating" nonfiltered="1294" processed="1282" dbindex="451309">

Inline speed skating is the sport of racing on inline skates. It is often called inline racing by participants. Although it primarily evolved from racing on "quad" roller skates, the sport is similar enough to ice speed skating that many competitors are now known to switch between inline and ice speed skating according to the season.

 The skate .
Videos of skating

An inline speed skate is a specialized version of the inline skate. The boot or shoe is close-fitting, without much padding and usually made of leather and/or carbon composites. For best performance the boot must conform closely to the shape of the foot, so most inline speed skating boots are heat-moldable, which allows the user to re-shape the boots to some extent when heat is applied.

The frame (sometimes called the chassis or plate) which holds the wheels is made of aircraft-quality aluminum and sometimes magnesium and usually mounts four to five polyurethane wheels of between 78 mm and 110 mm diameter. Each wheel contains 2 precision bearings with an aluminum spacer.

Bearing sizes have been standardized around the 608 series, though some manufacturers have tried 688 series or smaller in hopes of reducing weight.  These smaller bearings have been met with limited success due to frame design issues and the need for proprietary design wheels.  Bearing precisions run from ABEC-1 to ABEC-9.  While the ABEC system characterizes most bearings, some quality bearings do not have an ABEC rating.  Rather, they may simply be described as "Swiss" bearings. Additionally, bearings with ceramic balls have been marketed since the late 1990s. These presumably do not have the potential corrosion problems of metal ball bearings, but they come at a significantly higher purchase price. Ceramic bearings are also considered more fragile and less durable than metal bearings.

Wheels made for inline speed skating tend to have a higher durometer, so they are harder than recreational wheels but less hard than aggressive wheels.  The higher durometer contributes to less wear and greater speed, but also less resistance, a factor that can increase a skater's endurance.  Different wheels types are designed for particular skating conditions, such as indoor or outdoor, road or track, wet or dry, and rough or smooth surfaces. Preferable conditions (dry, indoor, smooth) lend themselves to harder wheels and higher speeds.

Although clap skate frames similar to those used in long track ice speed skating have been designed for inline racing, they have so far not proven to be superior to the normal fixed frame that inline racers use.  In the past, most speed skaters used either four or five 80 mm wheels.  Beginning in about 2002, elite inline speed skaters began employing fixed-frame "big-wheel" skates which have recently become the standard. These frames hold four or five wheels that may be from 84 mm to 110 mm in diameter.

A somewhat different form of inline speed skate uses a monocoque design. The boot and frame are made as one piece of carbon fiber material and offer noticeable savings in weight. They are, however, not widely used because they cost about four to five times the price of a high-quality standard boot-frame combination and require custom casting of the skater's feet, which is a costly and laborious process.

Technique and control.

Mechanically, strokes in speed skating are deeper and faster (to a sharper angle, closer to the point of losing traction) than recreational skating but not as deep and faster than ice speed skating.  This is because of the greater frictional forces in the direction of travel and lesser ability to apply friction without slipping of wheels on a hard surface compared to a steel blade on ice.

Speedskaters may also move each foot across the centerline of travel, leading to the double push method popularized by  the United States skater Chad Hedrick. The technique literally allows for two pushes in each stroke of the skate. However, it can also be tiring and even pro-elite skaters will often save it until needed, such as the latter stages or final sprint of a distance race. The double push is usually only used for outdoor racing.

Turning is significantly more difficult with inline speed skates than recreational skates because of more and larger wheels, creating a longer wheelbase.  The wheel profile, that is, the cross-section,  is parabolic, with a sharper shape than recreational or aggressive wheels, allowing the skater to essentially skate on a smaller, and hence more agile, wheel when leaned over in a turn.

Brakes are not generally used on speed skates so various other techniques to slow down are used, such as slaloming (skating s-curves) or v-plowing, where the heels are pushed outward and the toes inward.  It is not readily obvious to an observer from a skater's stance that the skater is v-plowing, if it were the skater would quickly crash.  The v-plow is often the stop used in situations where there is little lateral and forward room to stop.  One technique is the T-stop, essentially dragging one foot perpendicular to and behind the other, however this wears the wheels of that skate quickly.  Another stop involves picking up one foot and setting it down quickly and repeatedly somewhat perpendicular to the forward motion while keeping weight on the other foot.  Hockey stops are possible on speed skates, but require a very deep lean in order to cause the wheels to lose traction and slide, also the fact that wheels are sliding means that the wheels are also wearing down very quickly.  Grass runouts are always a last option, given an adjacent grassy area.

Generally a bicycle needs a longer stopping distance than a car and has less options in an emergency situation, thus the cyclist must plan further ahead and look further ahead. An inline speedskater takes much longer to stop than even a cyclist and often has still fewer options in an emergency, often taking several hundred feet on a level surface to come to a stop at a full, controlled deceleration.  Thus, a skater should be familiar with and proficient in stopping techniques before attempting difficult situations such as heavily travelled roads or hills.

An excellent book on inline racing technique and training is Speed on Skates by Barry Publow (ISBN 0-88011-721-4). Although dated because it was published in 1999 prior to significant changes in skate designs, the book nevertheless remains a valuable resource and is the only inline racing text widely available in North America.

 Race venues and formats .

Inline speed skating races are held in a variety of formats and on a variety of surfaces.

Indoor races are most common in the United States, which has a long tradition of racing on skates at rinks.  The competitions are generally held at roller skating rinks with plastic coated wood floors and less commonly, a plastic coated cement floor. The track is about 100 m in circumference.  At USARS events, tracks are marked by four pylons set in a rectangular shape, while at NIRA events, tracks are marked by multiple pylons that create an oval shaped track. Events, or meets, are typically structured so that members of numerous age groups race in three or four distances.  For the more populous divisions, there may be a number of heats in order to qualify for the final race. To some extent, indoor inline races are similar to short track speed skating.

Outdoor races may be held on regular pavement on city streets or park roads, or they may be held at specialized venues similar to velodromes, sometimes called patinodromes. A patinodrome is generally about 400 m in circumference and may be surfaced with asphalt, concrete or similar material. The curves may be banked. Such specialized skating tracks are relatively common in Europe but rare in the United States.

Race formats include:

Time trials: Held "against the clock", each skater races individually or in pairs over a distance of 100 m to 300 m, attempting to establish the best time. Time trials are occasionally held over longer distances, but they are very physically demanding and not popular.

Sprints: Skating in small groups of about a half dozen over a distance of 500 m to 1500 m, skaters advance in a series of heats to a final round.

Elimination races: In these moderate-distance races, also known as last man out, the hindmost skater is eliminated from the competition each time the pack of skaters complete a lap or when they complete certain specified lap numbers. At one or two laps to before the finish, the group has usually been pared down to four or five skaters.  At this point the first across the finish line is the winner.

Points races: In these moderate-distance races, the first, second and third skaters to cross the start/finish line at certain specified laps are awarded points. Laps late in the race are worth more points, with the final lap worth the most points of all. It is possible to win a points race without actually being the first to cross the finish line at the end.

Points-elimination races: A combination of elimination races and points races.

Relays: Relay events include teams of two to four skaters each. Indoor meets may include "mixed" relay events in which teams have either one girl and one boy OR two girls and two boys, but outdoor relays (usually held on tracks) are usually if not always single-sex events.  In a mix relay, it is traditional that a female goes to the starting line as the first skater to race.

Criterium races: Instead of racing a specified distance or number laps, the skaters skate for a certain amount of time, then plus a (small) number of laps. The time is typically between 15 and 45 minutes, after which a bell is rung and the skaters informed the race is over when they skate one or two more laps around the course. The portion of the race skated after the bell is rung is known as the bell lap (or laps).

Distance races: Although events such as points-elimination races and criteriums may cover a distance of 10 to 25 km, a distance race usually refers to a race over a set distance of about 5 km or longer and without specialized points or elimination rules. The event may be truly point-to-point or may held on a repeating course with a circumference of at least 1 km. Distance races are often marketed to the general populace and not just to members of inline racing clubs.

In the early days of inline racing, sponsors of distance races were often also running event organizers, and the races they organized were commonly the same distances as those of running races, about 5-10 km. By the mid-1990s such events were proving to not be very popular and in the United States, where sales of inline skates were also beginning to slip, there was a decline in participation at races. However, at about that time in Europe, where inline skate sales were beginning to rise, race sponsors began to regularly organize longer events, particularly inline marathons. Such events proved to be enormously popular among fitness skaters, with some events such as the Berlin Inline Marathon and the Engadin Inline Marathon in St. Moritz, Switzerland, regularly attracting over 5000 skaters each year.

In about 2000 American event sponsors followed suit, and inline half-marathons and marathons were scheduled more and more frequently around the country. As in Europe the events proved a big draw with fitness skaters looking for events which would give their training a focus. However, by 2005 this surge was tempered as some major events were either postponed for a year or cancelled permanently. In the United States the most popular inline marathon has continued to be the NorthShore Inline Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. 

Dryland triathlons: Occasionally organized by triathlon sponsors, these events substitute inline skating for the swimming component of the race. These event were infrequent even during the mid 1990s boom in inline skating participation. Today they are rare to non-existent.

Downhill races: An event most popular in the Alpine countries of Europe, these races are timed events down a steep course. Racers usually skate alone and the event commonly uses the best time of two heats to establish the winner. Downhill inline racers usually wear skates much more like "regular" inline skates than inline speed skates, along with extensive body covering and protective gear, and strong helmets. They may reach speeds of up to 75 km/h.

 Tactics .

Tactics in outdoor inline racing are similar to those of marathon ice speed skating and of road bicycle racing. Skaters tend to form packs or pacelines in which skaters line up behind a lead skater, thereby saving energy by skating in his draft. Sportsmanship requires that skaters in the paceline share the duty as paceline leader. Those who never take a pull at the front will likely find other skaters tacitly working together to defeat them.

During the course of a race skaters may make attacks, speeding up the pace in an effort to weed out the weaker and slower competition. These attacks may include breakaways and fliers, in which skaters try to create new smaller and faster packs or else to escape entirely from the other skaters. Depending on the length of the race and the skills and the cooperative effort of the chasers, these breakaways may or may not prove successful. If a skater escapes a pack in order to join a successful breakaway group, it is known as bridging up.

When skaters who are member of teams participate in a race together, they often have pre-determined roles. One or two would be designated attackers whose role it is to tire out the competition. Another skater may be the designated winner for the team, and he may avoid chasing any breakaways until late in a race, possibly until the final sprint if the lead pack has never broken up. Professional teams usually also include skaters whose role is to slow down the chase group when it looks like a team member is on a potentially successful breakaway.

 Olympic status .

As of 2006, inline speed skating is not an Olympic sport, and prospects that it will gain such status are dim. Attempts by the world governing body for roller sports, the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS), to gain Olympic status for any of its disciplines were distinctly insufficient in the closing decades of the 20th century. Most notably, it failed to capitalize when rink hockey (a form of roller hockey) appeared as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Efforts by FIRS to obtain Olympic status became more coherent in about 2000, with inline speed skating promoted as the roller sport best suited for the Olympics. However, the federation faces competition from approximately 20 other sports also seeking entry into the Olympics, while at the same time the president of the International Olympic Committee has expressed a desire to reduce the size of the summer Olympic Games.

Because inline racing does not have Olympic status, a number of inline speed skaters have switched to ice speed skating in order to have a chance at attending the Olympics. The first of these was KC Boutiette, who made the switch in late 1993 and skated at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. This migration to ice proved successful in 2002 when three former inline speed skaters from the United States won five medals in long track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They were Derek Parra, Jennifer Rodriguez and Joey Cheek. In late 2002, American inline champion Chad Hedrick similarly switched to ice, and in February 2004, he won the World Allround Speed Skating Championships. He was the first American to win that event since Eric Flaim in 1988. In 2006,  Hedrick and Cheek also won one gold medal each at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.

USA Roller Sports is the official American national governing body recognized by the US Olympic Committee.

Glymdrápa ("Drápa of din") is a skaldic poem composed by Þorbjörn hornklofi toward the end of the 9th century. It recounts several battles waged by Haraldr hárfagri ("Fairhair"), mostly as he was subduing Norway. 

Composed in dróttkvætt, only seven stanzas and two half-stanzas of it were preserved, chiefly in the Heimskringla (Haralds saga hárfagra). Glymdrápa is the oldest praise poem to a king (konungsdrápa) which has come down to us.

The poem recounts Haraldr's fight against the people of Orkdal at Oppdal forest (Uppdalsskógr), the two battles of Solskjel, the first against king of Møre Húnþjófr, his son Sölvi and his father-in-law Nökkvi, king of Romsdal, the second against Sölvi and his allies Arnviðr, king of Sunnmøre, and Auðbjörn, who ruled over the Fjords, his battles agains the Gotlanders and finally his expedition westwards to fight vikings, which led him to the Isle of Man.

Manipur is a region of India.  Some varieties of folk music from the area include the rural love songs khullong ishei, the rhythmic Lai Haraoba ishei, which contain lyrics with veiled references to erotic mysticism and pena ishei, which is accompanied by a pena, an instrument made from a bamboo rod and the shell of a gourd or coconut.  The pena is an ancient instrument that is a sort of national symbol for Manipuris.

Other songs include the religious thabal chongba, the classical nat music performed at various special occasions, the women's devotional napi pala songs, Gaur Padas, sung in praise of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and dhob, sung accompanied by the jhal, a large cymbal.  Manohar Sai is another important class of songs, devoted to a 19th century man of the same name.  Khubaishei is a kind of song accompanied entirely by clapping.
